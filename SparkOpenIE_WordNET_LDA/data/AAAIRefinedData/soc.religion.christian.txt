rograms I spend
about half the time talking about absitinence 
I find that most people who object
to sex education actually object to the teaching anything other than
abstinencne and that IMO is just as irresponsible as only talking
about comdom use

I'm under the impression that most sex ed instructors andor policy makers
actually object to making any more than a passing reference to abstinence
wishing to spend time only on the realistic choices 

In the sex ed portion of the  high school health course I took
in  it was impressed that the only  positive way to not
get pregnant was to not have sex

Other methods of contraception were discussed in the framework of
a chart which showed both the expected failure rate theoretical
assumes no mistakes and the actual failure rate based on research
Top of the chart was something like this


 Method                  Expected         Actual 
                  Failure Rate    Failure Rate
 Abstinence                                


And NFP Natural Family Planning was on the bottom The teacher even
said I've had some students tell me that they can't use anything for
birth control because they're Catholic Well if you're not married and
you're a practicing Catholic the top of the list is your slot not 
the bottom  Even if you're not religious the top of the list is
safest

Yes this was a public school and after Dr Koop's failing abstinence
use a condom statement on the prevention of AIDS

Hi

I'm new to this group and maybe this has been covered already
but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the
environment being turned unintentionally of course into
pantheism

I've debated this quite a bit and while I think a legitimate
concern for the planet is a great thing I can easily see it
being perverted into something dangerous

As evidence may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL of all
things April  Editorial page
We suspect that's because one party to the environmental
dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified  It's clear that much
of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been
called the Religious Left a SECULAR or even PAGAN fanaticism
that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a
reverence formerly accorded real religions  EMPHASIS MINE

I am fairly new to this group 
I was wondering about people's opinions on 
ethical uses of the net and of technology in general

the classic references in this area are Jacques Ellul for a
liberalevangelical perspective and Os Guiness for a straight
evangelical view  If you want to look at nonchristian sources
try Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist  His views while
blatently non christian explore where technology may be going

For example there are some chain letters going
around which claim to have been written by a Christian missionary but
which present a misleading image of the Christian religion 

This is regardless of technology  Be careful to separate the issues of
related to speed and dispersion of technology how far the letter
went and how quickly it got there and the message being passed in the
technology something that seems to be totally wrong

How can we help to make best use of computer technology 

When lecturing in this area I challenge my nonchristanatheistic class
about the impact technology has on life quality of life and the rights
that they consider important  Depending on how you work out your
faith will determine your response to the use of technology  For example
friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the
wife is going through when it is over they will have the baby God
willing  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to
decide what to do  In all cases though you must decide if the technology
is against God's revealed word

Matt  'Go therefore to the main highways and as many as you find
there invite to the wedding feast'

hmmmmmm  Sounds like your theology and Christ's are at odds Which one am I 
to believe

In this parable Jesus tells the parable of the wedding feast The kingdom
of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son
So the wedding clothes were customary  and given to those who chose to
attend  This man refused to wear the clothes  The wedding clothes are
equalivant to the clothes of righteousness  When Jesus died for our sins
those clothes were then provided  Like that man it is our decision to
put the clothes on

I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract It is a
bit lengthy for a posting but I thought I'd share it with all of you
anyway Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might
benefit from what it says May God richly bless those who read it
 

 
                   D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U 
 
 
Q What  kind  of  question  is that   Anyone who can read sees signs
   tracts books and bumper stickers that say God Loves You  Isn't
   that true
 
A It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world as we read
   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible
 
      For  God  so  loved  the world that he gave his only begotten
      Son that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish  but
      have everlasting life                               John 
 
   However God's love is qualified  The Bible says
 
      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD  but he
      loveth him that followeth after righteousness   Proverbs 
 
      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of
      the ungodly shall perish                            Psalm 
 
 
Q But  I am not wicked  I am a decent moral person  Surely the good
   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done   How
   can these verses apply to me
 
A By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is
   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell    The
   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven
   On  the  contrary  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before
   God
 
      As it is written There is none righteous no not one  There
      is  none  that understandeth there is none that seeketh after
      God                                            Romans 
 
      The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things and desperately
      wicked who can know it                         Jeremiah 
 
 
Q If I am such a wicked person in God's sight what will God do to me
 
A The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will
   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell
 
      For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the
      lowest hell and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase
      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains  I will heap
      mischiefs upon them I will spend mine arrows upon them  They
      shall  be  burnt  with hunger and devoured with burning heat
      and  with  bitter  destruction  I will also send the teeth of
      beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust
                                                Deuteronomy 
 
 
Q Oh  come  on now   Hell is not real is it  Surely things are not
   that bad
 
A Indeed  Hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ
   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior    The  Bible
   makes  many  references  to Hell indicating that it is both eternal
   and consists of perpetual suffering
 
      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was
      cast into the lake of fire                   Revelation 
 
      So  shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come
      forth and sever the wicked from among  the  just  And  shall
      cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and
      gnashing of teeth                            Matthew 
 
          when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
      his mighty angels In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them
      that  know  not  God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord
      Jesus   Christ    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting
      destruction  from the presence of the Lord and from the glory
      of his power                             Thessalonians 
 
 
Q That is terrible  Why would God create a Hell
 
A Hell  is  terrible  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be
   accountable to God for his actions  God's perfect  justice  demands
   payment for sin
 
      For the wages of sin is death                     Romans 
 
      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ
      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body
      according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad
                                                   Corinthians 
 
      But I say unto you That every idle word that men shall speak
      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment
                                                       Matthew 
 
 
Q Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought
   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell
 
A Indeed  it  does  that  is  unless  we  can find someone to be our
   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our
   sins    That  someone  is  God  Himself who came to earth as Jesus
   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him
 
      All  we  like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one
      to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of
      us all                                            Isaiah 
 
      But  he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for
      our iniquities the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him
      and with his stripes we are healed                Isaiah 
 
      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also
      received how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the
      scriptures And that he was buried and that he rose again the
      third day according to the scriptures     Corinthians 
 
      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that
      we might be made the righteousness of God in him
                                                   Corinthians 
 
 
Q Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute Who was
   already punished for my sins then I will not have  to  worry  about
   Hell anymore
 
A Yes this is so  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior then it
   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God
   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins
 
      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life and he
      that believeth not the Son shall not see life but  the  wrath
      of God abideth on him                               John 
 
 
Q But  what  does it mean to believe on Him  If I agree with all that
   the Bible says about Christ as Savior then am I saved from going to
   Hell
 
A Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our
   minds with the truths of the Bible  It means that we hang our whole
   lives  on Him   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to
   the  truths  of the Bible  It means that we turn away from our sins
   and serve Christ as our Lord
 
      No man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one
      and  love  the  other  or  else  he will hold to the one and
      despise the other Ye cannot serve God and mammon
                                                        Matthew 
 
      Repent  ye  therefore and be converted that your sins may be
      blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from  the
      presence of the Lord                                Acts 
 
 
Q Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except
   through Jesus   What about all the other  religions    Will  their
   followers also go to Hell
 
A Yes indeed  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account
   able  for  our  sins   God demands that we pay for our sins  Other
   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their
   followers  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and
   save us
 
      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other for there is none
      other name under heaven given among men whereby  we  must  be
      saved                                               Acts 
 
   Jesus said
 
      I  am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the
      Father but by me                                   John 
 
      If  we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us
      our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
                                                           John 
 
 
Q Now I am desperate  I do not want to go to Hell  What can I do
 
A You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you  You
   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God   As  you  see
   your hopeless condition as a sinner cry out to God to save you
 
      And the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much
      as  his  eyes  unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying
      God be merciful to me a sinner                     Luke 
 
        Sirs what must I do to be saved  And they said Believe
      on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved 
                                                       Acts 
 
 
Q But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him
 
A Wonderfully  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus but He
   also gives us the faith to believe on Him  You can pray to God that
   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior
 
      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith and that not of
      yourselves it is the gift of God               Ephesians 
 
   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith  So
   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation you
   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible which is
   the only Word of God
   In  this  brochure  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented
   paragraphs  Give heed to them with all your heart
 
      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of
      God                                              Romans 
 
 
Q But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God
 
A Yes    God wants us to come to Him in total humility acknowledging
   our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in Him
 
      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit a broken and a
      contrite heart O God thou wilt not despise      Psalm 
 
   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins  Therefore we must begin
   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins    And  if  we
   sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins
   as  God  strengthens  us    We know that our sins are sending us to
   Hell
 
      Unto  you  first God having raised up his Son Jesus sent him
      to bless you in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his
      iniquities                                          Acts 
 
 
Q Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be
   baptized  Will these save me
 
A If  possible  we should do these things but they will not save us
   No work of any kind can secure our salvation   Salvation  is  God's
   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas
   ure  Salvation is
 
      Not of works lest any man should boast         Ephesians 
 
 
Q What else will happen at the end of the world
 
A Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed
   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever
   more
 
      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout
      with the voice of the archangel and with the  trump  of  God
      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first  Then we which are
      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
      clouds  to meet the Lord in the air  and so shall we ever be
      with the Lord                          Thessalonians 
 
 
Q What will happen to the earth at that time
 
A God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens
   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever
   more
 
      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in
      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise  and
      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and
      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up    
      Nevertheless  we  according  to  his  promise  look  for new
      heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
                                                      Peter 
 
 
Q Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will
   come
 
A Yes    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to
   save
 
      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
      world for a witness unto all nations and then shall  the  end
      come                                            Matthew 
 
 
Q Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be
 
A Yes   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing
   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the
   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not
   come  as  a  thief for the believers  There is much evidence in the
   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be
   very very close All the time clues in the Bible point to this
 
      For  when  they  shall  say  Peace  and  safety  then sudden
      destruction cometh upon them as travail  upon  a  woman  with
      child and they shall not escape           Thessalonians 
 
      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing but he revealeth his
      secret unto his servants the prophets                Amos 
 
 
Q But that means Judgment Day is almost here
 
A Yes  it  does    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to
   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning
 
      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey and he
      cried  and  said  Yet  forty  days  and  Nineveh  shall  be
      overthrown                                          Jonah 
 
 
Q What did the people of Nineveh do
 
A From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God repented
   of their sins and cried to God for mercy
 
      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth and cry
      mightily unto God yea let them turn every one from his  evil
      way  and  from  the violence that is in their hands  Who can
      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent and turn away from his
      fierce anger that we perish not                  Jonah 
 
 
Q Did God hear their prayers
 
A Yes  God saved a great many people of Nineveh
 
 
Q Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg
   ment
 
A Yes   There is still time to become saved even though that time has
   become very short
 
      How  shall  we escape if we neglect so great salvation which
      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
      unto us by them that heard him                    Hebrews 
 
      In  God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength
      and my refuge is in God   Trust in  him  at  all  times  ye
      people  pour  out  your heart before him God is a refuge for
      us                                               Psalm

I have read Mr Camping's book compared it with what the Bible actual

there  is just too much data to ignore  While none of us is guaranteed
one  more  second  of  life and while we therefore should take these

    A very nice article on the DSS which I thought answered
     David CruzUribe's original queries quite well

   Here are some books I have read recently that helped me not only
   prepare for a  week series I taught in Sunday School but greatly
   increased my knowledge of the Qumran scrolls 

One other recent book I would heartily recommend is Joseph Fitzmyer's
Response to  Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls Paulist


Fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern NT scholars  He was also one
of the early workers on the DSS  His book is written in a
straightforward QA that allows it to serve as a source for a great
wealth of clearly presented basic uptothemoment information about
the DSS

This book is something of a companion volume to Raymond Brown's

I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my
wife and me lately liturgy in particular Catholic liturgy  In the last few
years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass  It's
driving me crazy  The most gracefilled aspect of a liturgical tradition is
that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how to 
do it  Led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we 
present to God  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers

Lately I think the proportion of participation has fallen and the proportion
of sitting there and watching or listening or generally being told what to do
which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next is growing
Example  Last Sunday Palm Sunday we went to the local church  Usually
on Palm Sunday the congregation participates in reading the Passion taking
the role of the mob  The theology behind this seems profoundwhen we say
Crucify him we mean it  We did it and if He came back today we'd do it
again  It always gives me chills  But last week we were invited to sit
during the Gospel Passion and listen  Besides the Orwellian invitation 
I was really saddened to have my and our little role taken away  This seems
typical of a shift of participation away from the people and toward the
musicians readers and so on  New things are introduced in the course of the
liturgy and since no one knows what's happening the new things have to be
explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the Mass we're just
sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the Mass is about
to be done  In my mind I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay
experts but that may not be just  I do think that a liturgy committee has a
bias toward doing something rather than nothingthat's just a fact of
bureaucratic lifeeven though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for
people to be aware of the Lord's presence

So we've been wonderingare we the oddballs or is the quality of the Mass
going down  I don't mean that facetiously  We go to Mass every Thursday or
Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware 
of God's presence  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Massesmaybe I should 
just offer it up   Has anyone else noticed declining congregational
participation in Catholic Masses lately

Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies  While I'm not real sure of
his credibility I do remember a book he wrote called A VISION or
something like that  He made a prediction that people who bought gold
would be hurt financially  At the time gold was up to about 
now it is less than half that  This prediction stuck in my mind
because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold

The problem is we tend to remember predictions that come true and
forget ones that didn't a la Jean Dixon  Does anyone know if there
any of his predictions perhaps from the book I mentioned that can
pretty definitely be said to have not come true

I am doing a dormitory bible discussion with my Christian roommate and
 of the nonChristian guys on my floor  They are very close to
accepting Christ so we have started to disciple them treat them like
baby believers and go into more indepth subjects than the parables etc
Our first discussion was on prayer  Eventually we got around to how
we should pray in Jesus' name  Then an excellent question came up one
that I don't have a real answer to  The question was If we need to pray
in Jesus' name what about the people before Jesus  They prayed to God
and he listened then in spite of their sins  Why can't it be the same
way now

I'll take a try at this

From the discussions I have been in and from how I have interpreted
the bible I feel that one can pray either way  BUT remember this
before Jesus the people talked to God no other way and he talked 
back  audible and dreams etc  Today we have the bible to know 
Gods will and we have his son you died for US  He was given as our
savior and while we still do things according to Gods will we pray
THROUGH his son  In the bible it says that if we are not known to 
Jesus we are not known to God  sorry I do not have the verses
with me  So if we are to be granted eternal life we must present
ourselves to Jesus first who will then present us to God

That seems a most peculiar interpretation of the text The apostles and

Remember the OT doctrine of  witnesses  Perhaps the prophets

After all what does prophesy mean  Secondly what is an Apostle  Answer
an especial witnessone who is suppose to be a personal witness  That means
to be a true apostle one must have Christ appear to them  Now lets see

Now as to the suggestion that all prophecy tends to be somewhat cyclical
can you elaborate  I'm not exactly sure what you mean  How does the
suggestion relate to Isaiah's prophecy of the birth of Christ by a virgin 
I don't see any cycles in that prophecy

Maybe cyclical is not the best word  That is one aspect of it  In the
case of the virgin birth prophecy it applied to the then and there and
also prophetically to Christ  The army that threatened the king would 
cease to be a threat in a very short time  Yet it also prophecied of 
Christ

Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the
time they were made  Out of Egypt have I called my Son refers both
to Israel and prophetically to Christ   Why do the heathen rage
was said of David and also of Christ  

Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas and his bishoprick
let another take  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His
disciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews the children thou
hast given me

How does the preterist view account for this phenomenon

 What exactly is a definition of sin and what are some examples How does a
 person know when they are committing sin
 

Anything that does not bring me closer to God is a sin 
If you think this is too strict just consider how ambiguous it is

This implies that staying the same is a sin A Christian should
never be satisfied It does not imply that
having fun is a sin It does not imply that sleeping is a sin
It does imply that I sin every day

A perhaps simpler definition
Anything that is counter to the two Great Commandments 
love God love your neighbor is a sin
Anything I do that is not from love is a sin

The same action can be a sin sometimes and not a sin sometimes

I could yell at my kids as discipline all the time loving them
considering only to teach them proper behavior or I could yell at my
kids out of anger or selfishness

I could post an excellent article because I am interested in sharing
my opinions and getting feedback and learning or I could post an
article because I want everyone to realize how wise I am

 something for Christians to consider

Jayne stands in pretty good company  CS Lewis wrote a whole book
promoting the idea contained in her first sentence quoted above  It is
called The Final Divorce  Excellent book on the subject of Heaven and

In article Aprathosrutgersedu evensontspotColoradoEDU EVENSON THOMAS RANDALL writes

Which brings me around to asking an open question  Is the Bible a closed
book of Scripture  Is it okay for us to go around saying God told
me this and Jesus told me that  Wouldn't that imply that God is STILL
pouring out new revelation to us  I know that some people will feel
that is okay and some will not  The concept of a closed canon would
certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets  On the other hand
an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes

There are a lot of people running around saying God told me this and 
God told me that these days  Some people really have heard God and others
heard their glands  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once  He
said someone told him The Lord gave me a song  He said that it was
the worst song he had ever heard

I know why he gave you that song Murillo said He didn't want it anymore

But God does still speak to His people today and the idea is contrary to the
idea of a closed cannon  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit
in the church of His day nd and rd century and he was one of the first
to put forth a New Testament cannon which was almost identical to the one
we have today  He believed in a closed cannon  

Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures
For example one prophet in Kings whose name starts with an M who
prophecied that the king would lose a battle  That is the only prophecy
he gave recorded in Scripture and we no that he had given other prophecies
because the king complained before he heard the prophecy He never prophesies
anything good about me  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his 
lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture  There are numerous examples
Barnabas was a prophet Acts says before he was even sent out as an 
apostle  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture  Only two of
Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture  He was already a prophet
before he gave them  

So prophecy may be genuine and from God but that does not make it 
Scripture  

Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new
but rather an inspired translation of scripture  Is it right to call
that prophecy  Misleading  Wouldn't that be more having to do with
knowledge

I don't know about translations of Scripture but I am familiar with 
prophecies that give applications for Scripture  There are also 
similar examples in the Bible  Several times Peter interprets prophecies
in a seemingly prophetic way for example And his bishoprick let another
take concerning Judas office

A clearer example can be found in Matthew   Jesus is prophesying about
what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel
about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood  So Scriptural
prophecy can be used in later prophecy  

Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge
but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap  Words of knowledge and wisdom
can overlap  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap  
Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy  Healings are often
considered miracles  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a 
bit hazy  Imho it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to
label a phenomenon as long as we recognize them as the work of the 
Spirit and use them according to His leading

Many Christians believe in abstinence but in a moment will be overcome
by desire  We all compromise and rationalize poor choices sin  Last
week I was guilty of anger jealousy and whole mess of other stuff
yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with AIDs  To even
suggest that AIDS is deserved is ludicrous

Some rules are made because at some point man is too stupid
to know better Yet eventually man learns But only after
getting a lesson from experience

Yes it's important to realize that all actions have consequences
and that rules were made for our own good  But to suggest that a
disease is a punishment for certain types of sin I think is 
taking things much too far  If we got some kind of mouth disease
for lying would any of us have mouths left  What if we developed
blindness every time we lusted after someone or something  I dare
say all of us would be walking into walls

I wonder if AIDS would be a problem now if people didn't get
involved in deviant sexual behaviour Certainly people who
received tainted blood are not to blame But it just goes
to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few

Yes sin can have terrible consequences but we need to be real
careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for 
sin  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the
result of a sin  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was
blind to show the glory of God not because of sin  If AIDS or any
other STD is a punishment for sexual sin what do we do with 
diseases like cancer or multiple sclerosis which are just as
debilitating and terrible as AIDS yet are not usually linked to a
specific behavior or lifestyle

In addition IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things
There is still the matter of atonement Is it AIDS 
I don't know

Atonement is extremely important but I think you've missed the mark
about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin
The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST  period  This is the central
message of the Gospel  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins
and was made in the Lamb of God  His sacrifice atoned for all of
our sins past present and future  God does not require pennance for
our sins nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement  He
has graciously already done that for us  To suggest that AIDS or 
some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting
on the sacrifice that Jesus made

In case you couldn't tell I get extremely angry and upset when
I see things like this  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and
phobias we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other
socially unacceptable diseases  Whether they got the disease through
their own actions or not is irrelevant  They still need Jesus Christ
no more and no less than we do  I've said this before but I think
it's a good analogy  People with AIDS are modernday lepers  Jesus
healed many lepers  He can also heal people with AIDS maybe not on
this earth but in an ultimate sense  My nextdoor neighbor has AIDS
She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed 
relationship with God  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be
but God's grace covers her  The amazing thing is that she is gaining
weight she's had the disease for over  years and her health is
excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such  She attributes
her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life  Who
are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment  It
seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease

Paul Overstreet the country singer has a good song title that I 
think applies to all of us  But for the Grace of God There Go I
or something like that

May we all experience and accept God's grace

I seldom see any posts in this group Is anyone out there in Christendom
listening If so why don't we get some dialog going here

Here's a topic to get things started My daughter's Christian school sends
home a weekly update on school related topics This week they sent
something very interesting It was an article written by the leader of a
national US Christian school organization about a trip he recently made
to Jerusalem While there he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is
working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem The article
included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in
preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the
specifications given in the Bible 

What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are
complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli
government before beginning the building The other startling fact is the
very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is
unoccupied and available for building Previously it has been thought that
the original site was underneath what is now a mosque making rebuilding
impossible without sparking a holy war 

Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming
sacrifices as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days
Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start I think
it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it
happen Brothers and sisters the time is at hand Our redemption is
drawing near Look up

much of the excellent post deleted for space  TjL

With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer  
it
would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed  
conspiracy
would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax   
Yet
not one did  It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not  
make
up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually  
risen
from the dead especially in light of the sufferings that came upon  
those
who believed


I was at the Jubilee conference this year in Pittsburgh PA and the  
speaker there spoke of this as well He talked about many of the same  
things you mentioned in your post but here he went into a little more  
detail  I'll paraphrase as best I can

Suppose you were part of the Christian consipracy' which was going to  
tell people that Christ had risen  Never mind the stoning the being  
burned alive the possible crucifixion  let's just talk about a  
scourging  The whip that would be used would have broken pottery metal  
bone and anything else that they could find attached to it  You would be  
stood facing a wall with nothing to protect you

When the whip hit you the first time it would tear the flesh off you  
with instant incredibly intense pain  You would think to yourself All  
this for a lie'  The second hit would drop you to your knees you would  
scream out in agony that your raw back was being torn at again  You would  
say to yourself All this for a lie'  And you had  more coming

At the third hit you would scream out that it was all a lie beg for them  
to stop and tell them that you would swear on your life that it had all  
been a lie if they would only stop

It is amazing enough that those who believed kept their faith under such  
torture but for a lie  There is no one fool enough to do that And  
no one came forward

Excellent post John thanks for taking the time

	Is life a passfail course and does God grade on a
curve
	I'm new here and only vaguely religious but I want to
know what some of you people think  Specifically are there an
infinite number of Heavens and a person goes to the one that
heshe deserves  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing Hell
Also are we graded by those around us or has there always
been some unchanging method  Is the person's childhood taken
into account
	I'm sure these must sound like oversimplifications to
most of you but I figure that you're the experts

						Quinn

Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree  I suspect
that's because our primary source of information is prophets and
visionaries and their writings tend to be highly symbolic  However
both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation
to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and
eternal death  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that
imply some sort of differentiation eg Lk  and a number of
similar passages where Jesus says things like even XXX will be better
off than you in the judgement  Also I Cor  talks about someone who
gets into heaven but by the skin of his teeth as it were  But these
passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens
so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or
hell and not all Christians would even go as far as that  The only
Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the
Mormons and they are very far from mainstream Christianity far
enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian  Their
ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations in addition
to the Bible and Holy Tradition of a more generic Christian sort

Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of
associating grading with God  The whole point of Christ was to free
us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass  If you
like test analogies God grades on a very strict and unbending scale
but he also cheats  he replaces our test papers with an exam that
was prepared by the teacher before actually doing the grading
Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell it's easy to
see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading  While there are
differences among branches of Christianity on details I think we all
agree that in one way or another God cheats

I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly
how far God's cheating extends  Will he accept people who don't
explicitly acknowledge Christ but somehow still follow him in their
hearts  Many Christians believe that this is possible at least in
principle but certainly not all do  Jesus provided us with a clear
description of how to be saved but it's not clear to me that he
provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing
line  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether
other individuals are saved or not

evensontspotColoradoEDU EVENSON THOMAS RANDALL writes

Yes I suppose it is true that people make mistakes  It is interesting to
note that in those long ago OT days if you weren't  correct in
your prophecies people got very mad and you were no longer believed
even put to death

This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy  In the
NT it is expected that when believers gather
   people will prophesy
   the prophecy must be judged  Cor 
There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake

To say that we make mistakes is true  To say that we make mistakes
while filled with the spirit is not true  Were that true the entire
Bible having been written by men inspired by God would be subject also
to those errors for what is prophecy but like those revelations given
in scripture

Scripture is scripture there is no gift of scripture  And I don't know
about you but I know that I have made mistakes while filled with the
spirit  If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes they
will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts

When we minister in my small group I encourage people to speak out any
impressions or images they think might be from the Lord  Only by trying
will they know whether they were right or wrong  and in either case
they'll have a better handle on it the next time

Didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle  But you kept on
trying and you learned both from your failures and your successes
Spiritual gifts are no different  you get better with experience

Which brings me around to asking an open question  Is the Bible a closed
book of Scripture  Is it okay for us to go around saying God told
me this and Jesus told me that  Wouldn't that imply that God is STILL
pouring out new revelation to us  I know that some people will feel
that is okay and some will not  The concept of a closed canon would
certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets  On the other hand
an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes

The canon of Scripture is complete  Does this mean that God no longer
speaks  I have heard his voice  not audibly though some have but
clearly nonetheless  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture  No  I have
never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the
Lord is on the same level as Scripture on the contrary those who are
mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow
believers for judgement  And the most reliable yardstick for judging
prophecies is certainly the Scriptures themselves  The canon is closed
 but God is not silent

Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new
but rather an inspired translation of scripture  Is it right to call
that prophecy  Misleading  Wouldn't that be more having to do with
knowledge  I know the gift of knowledge may not be as exciting to
talk about but shouldn't we call a horse a horse

Does it matter what it is called  The question is not how to label it but
how to receive it  Words of knowledge incidentally are similar to
prophecy and sometimes the two overlap but generally it is supernatural
knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise

I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the
weekend accident the moderator described  This is an improved
version anyway so no loss the first time  HL

The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents 
is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass Hermeneutrik und 
Kritik Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen vol  of
Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums wissenshaft Noerdlingen
Beck   Portions of this are described in Nibley The 
Prophetic Book op Mormon pp  SLC  Deseret Book 
If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned  Nibley
describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little
knowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subject
and the reader  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form
of rules for forgers  It makes interesting reading

I confess that I have not read Blass's work only Nibley's extract
thereof  My German falls far short of what would be required and
as far as I know there is no English translation available  However
I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that 
any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient
document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one 
would expect of a genuine document of that time frame  We will not 
be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to 
determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and 
culture or is a later forgery

Actually there are  types of purportedly ancient documents

  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof  For example
the Dead Sea Scrolls  These can be tested by various scientific
means to determine the age of the paper inks and objects found
with them  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual
physical objects

  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the
copy itself may be much more recent  For example we might find a
document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something
from centuries ago perhaps even having been through several
generations of copists  This is more of a problem but can still 
be tested although the test is not likely to be simple  We cannot
expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so
we must confine our testing to the text itself

It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if
the document is really what it claims to be  They can only date the
document and identify its culture of origin  For example I've heard
of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king
in what is now Iraq  If this document were to actually turn up
scholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have the
holograph  They could check the language content and writing
style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a
Palestinian Jew of that time  However even if all test results were
positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually
wrote it  We would know what time and culture it came from but
barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for 
comparison scholarship must stop there  There is seldom any way to
determine who the actual author was

As I say I'm no expert on Blas's work  I do remember some of the
tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works  
Specifically we might ask

  Is the document internally consistent  Does it contradict
itself  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to 
maintain internal consistency even if it is a forgery  The 
longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency
For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents

  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time
Again a short nonspecific work might not be testable but if the
writing is of any significant length no latterday forger would be
able to escape detection  Here we look for the minor inconspicuous
things which someone from that culture would get right without even
thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous 
and trivial to check  The devil is in the details

  What about the literary style of the work figures of speech
etc  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that 
seem strange to us  Are there any such odd phrases in this book  
If so do they fit in with the culture

Of course there are complications if the document has been
translated or possibly even if somebody just updated language
when he copied it  A few cases of language not from the culture
claimed may be allowed in recent copies  They cause problems and
reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery

These tests can be quite effective given enough material to work 
with but they are not easy  They require the skills of the 
historian the linguist the anthropologist etc  The questions to 
ask are Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we 
know about the culture of claimed origin  If there are things 
which don't fit how significant are they  Are problem areas due to
our lack of knowledge later changes by copists or are they really 
significant  There will often be some ambiguity since we never
know everything about the culture

The end result of any such testing is occasionally certain
particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies
However often it may just be a probability or an indication that
the document or maybe parts of it is probably authentic or
sometimes maybe other parts are later additions  This is often 
unsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems are
solved in  to  minutes with time out for commercials  It is 
however the real world and what scholarship has to offer

I was brought up christian but I am not christian any longer
I also have a bad taste in my mouth over christianity  I in
my own faith accept and live my life by many if not most of the
teachings of christ but I cannot let myself be called a christian
beacuse to me too many things are done on the name of christianity
that I can not be associated with  

A question for you  can you give me the name of an organization or a
philosophy or a political movement etc which has never had anything
evil done in its name  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity 
man is inherently sinful  We are saved through faith by grace  Knowing
that believing that does not make us without sin  Furthermore not all
who consider themselves christians are even those who manage to head
their own churches  Not everyone who says to me 'Lord Lord' will
enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my Father who
is in heaven  Matt 

I also have a problem with the inconsistancies in the Bible and
how it seems to me that too many people have edited the original
documents to fit their own world views thereby leaving the Bible
an unbelievable source

Again what historical documents do you trust  Do you think Hannibal
crossed the Alps  How do you know  How do you know for sure  What
historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis
credit it as well as the Bible has

I don't have dislike of christians except for a few who won't
quit witnessing to me no matter how many times I tell them to stop 
but the christian faithorganized religion will never as far as i can 
see at the moment get my support

Well it's really a shame you feel this way  No one can browbeat you
into believing and those who try will probably only succeed in driving
you further away  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions
 is there an afterlife and if so does man require salvation to attain
it  If the answer is yes the next question is  how does man attain this
salvation  can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain
modern offshoots like the new age movement teach or does he require God's
help   If the latter in what form does  indeed in what form can such
help come  Needless to say this discussion could take a lifetime and for
some people it did comprise their life's writings so I am hardly in a
position to offer the answers here  merely pointers to what to ask  Few
of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives certainly not me
The spritual life is a difficult journey if you've never read A Pilgrim's
Progress I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language

Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a
conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing  You
wrote that I in my own faith accept and live my life by many if not most
of the teachings of christ  Well Christ referred to God as My Father
not My Mother and while the maleness of God is not the same as the
maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome it does not
honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy nondiscriminatory
or politically correct  This in no way disparages women nor is it my intent
to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women  
english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns  After all God
chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human
population

Well I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of
the role of women in Christianity at am with only  hours of sleep in the
last  and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this
article  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply  I hope I
may have given you and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of
mind something to contemplate

Firstly I am an atheist I am not posting here as an immature flame
start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience

The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily  I live 
in fear of what will happen when I  die   

I bet some of you are licking your lips now because you think that
I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus             

I was raised in a religious atmosphere and attended  years of
religious educational institutions  I know the bible well So well
I can recognize many passages from memory  

Strong opinions start here

 The human being is an animal who has due to hisher advanced
mental facilities developed religious as a satisfiable solution to
explain the unexplainable  For example the ancient Greeks believed
that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real  Due
to the advancement of our technology we know this to be false  

Christianity is an infectious cult  The reasons it flourishes are 
because  it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life
a safety blanked to hide behind  Oh wowall i have to do is 
follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness
For all of you found jeezus  how many of you were on the brink

but i digress   The other reason christianity flourishes is its
infectious nature  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian
group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which
basicaly said this Priority  Spread the Word


We are just animals  We need sleep food and we reproduce  And we
die      

Religion especially Christianity is nothing more than a DRUG
Some people use drugs as an escape from reality  Christians inject
themselves with jeezus and live with that high 

It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious
wars of which Christianity has had no small part

When Christians see a nonbeliever they say that person is blind
to the truth but they cannot realize that it is they who live
with this mask of fakeness each day  Jesus was just prophet  
who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans
were circa ad dispersing the Jewish population and communities
needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time
of dire need

I must go  These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity

 	I just thought I'd share some words that I received in a letter 
 from Moody Bible Institute a couple of months ago  The words are by
 James M Stowell the president of MBI
 
 	The other day I was at the dry cleaner and the radio was playing
 It caught my attention because a talk show guest was criticizing evangelical
 Christians saying we believe in absolutes and think we are the only ones
 who know what the absolutes are
 
 	He missed the point

No IMO Mr Stowell missed the point

 	We affirm the absolutes of Scripture not because we are arrogant
 moralists but because we believe in God who is truth who has revealed His
 truth in His Word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance
 of those absolutes

Mr Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes
I don't see how that necessarily follows  

Are all truths also absolutes
Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes

If the answer to either of these questions is no then perhaps you can 
explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths and
which truths are absolutes  And who is qualified to make these 
determinations  There is hardly consensus even in evangelical 
Christianity not to mention the rest of Christianity regarding 
Biblical interpretation

I find Mr Stowell's statement terribly simpleminded

 But since the manuscripts are so close to the actual event especially as

As for the dating of the oldest extant texts of the NT  How would

 My advice is this  If you know someone that you have the hots for who is
 NOT a Christian befriend them and try to develop just a friendship with
 them  At the same time witness and share the gospel with them not so
 that you can date them but so that they can be saved  Once they become a
 Christian then it is quite possible to let the relationship progress
 beyond friendship  However if they don't accept Christ you still have a
 good friendship and you haven't wasted a lot of emotional energy and gotten
 hurt

While I agree with most of Jon says I deleted those parts of course I 
have serious reservations about this advice  Maintaining a just 
friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done  People 
usually end up getting hurt  This is especially likely to happen when 
they start off with feelings of attraction  

When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement  
I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't 
date nonChristians to believing that dating this man would be okay to 
believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each 
other  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to 
their original state  

This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home 
and fellowship  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most 
people  However it's important not to underestimate the power of 
feelings of attraction

 first paragraph and the mention of pantheism  Is pantheism perverted
 and dangerous or just not one's cup of tea  None of this is clear

I can't speak for Mr Cavano but I understood his comment to refer to 
the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians  If we 
unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity 
we can pervert our faith  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we 
encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with 
Christianity and reject what isn't    

We need to be alert always thinking and questioning  We must examine 
the underlying assumptions of every book we read tv program we watch 
and sociopolitical movement we participate in  Ideas are important  
Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our 
lives  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and 
service  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy
headed drifting from idea to idea 

 and that consumerism and our rapacious style of living
 are so rarely called by their appropriate name Greed

One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope  It is a frequent theme 
in his writings  Indeed thoughtful Christians from most traditions 
recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians  It 
too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith  Thank you Jack for 
pointing out the parallel

 In Quebec French the word for the celebration of the resurrection is

 better because it uses the right name

I was at my parents' Seder and noticed the labelling on one of the 
packages was English Hebrew and French  In the phrase kosher for 
passover the French word used was Paques   We've deliberately 
mistranslated this at the Kulikauskas home and keep referring to foods 
being kosher for Easter 

Back to the original questions in this thread concerning Christians of 
Jewish descent and the Law  I always wonder when I see posts on this 
subject whether the writers are Christians of Jewish descent relating 
the lifedecisions God has led them to or people who take only an 
academic interest in the topic  Having known Seanna since she was nine 
years old I do know in this case  I admit that the answer to this 
question affects the amount of weight I give to the writer's statement

    These figures don't seem to take account of rape Or is a woman who
is raped considered not to have been abstaining

I no longer have the textbook but abstinence was defined as something
like no contact between the penis and the vagina vulva or area 
immediately surrounding the vulva and no transfer of semen to the
vagina vulva or area surrounding the vulva  

That is abstinence wasn't discussed as sex outside of marriage is
morally wrong but as keep  the sperm away from the ovum and conception 
is impossible The moral question I recall the teacher asking was
is it okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent

	I am a good Catholic boy A convert no less attracted by the
rational tradition Aquinas et al and the emotional authenticity
in comp with the faddishness of Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism I
never had much time for the pope  or any other heirarchs  but I did and
do believe in the sacremental system I always felt quite happy to
look down my nose at those such as John Emery a few posts back who
had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith entirely
oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same with
miracles too and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the
Bible as God's sole revelation it was not very good logic to argue
that the Bible proved God No I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's
revelation It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible the
Church that choose under grace of course the canon of scripture Protestant
ludicrosity I thought was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance
of Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked
	But recently I read Peter Brown's Body and Society It is very
well researched and well written But is raises some very upsetting
questions The early Christians were weird  even more so than today's
carzy fundies They had odd views on sex odder views on the body 
totally ludicrous views about demons and distinctly uncharitable
views about other human beings 
	now the question is this were the first Christians just as
weird but we've got used to them or did the pristine Fall of the
Church happen within one generation It certainly did'nt have to
wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine If so
wha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church
It's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church
not being an organization at me It's a community or it is nothing
and it was the early communities that were weird The institional
church was a model of sanity by comparison
	I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to
this entirely serious issue I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants
with their soul alone with Jesus approach but for we who see the
ecclesia as a koinoia over time and space the weird early
Christians are a problem

This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view  Many Protestants
have a strong appreciation for the role of the Church  The soul
alone with God is certainly important for Protestants but it's by no
means the whole story

I have read the sort of history you talk about  As you point out
Protestants don't have quite the same problem you do because we
believe that the church had a Fall at some point  However Protestant
mythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine or
more likely regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion
starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated
power during the medieval period  The consequences of having it
earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us  Most Protestants accept
the theological results of the early ecumenical councils including
such items as the Trinity and Incarnation  Indeed in the works of
Reformers such as Luther and Calvin you'll find Church Fathers such
as Augustine quoted all the time  I think you'll find many
Protestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was
wierd  There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't
much want to talk about in this context since it's been looked at
recently  that's the question of whether one can really think of
Augustine and other Fathers as being protoProtestants  Their views
on Mary the authority of the Pope etc are not entirely congenial to
Protestant thought

One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology
There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church  What
concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see  We
see every Christian who courted martyrdom  But I think there's good
reason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than
that  We see the heroic virgins  But I think there's good reason to
think that many Christians were happily married  I can't help
suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and
sane people that we do now  I think there's also a certain level of
revisionism active in history at the moment  I don't mean that
they're manufacturing things out of whole cloth  But don't you think
there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel

Quoth the Moderator

I have to say that I some qualms about giving you this explanation
because it raises additional problems If God is the source of all
existence then a complete separation from him would make existence
itself impossible  So does God maintain just enough connection with
those who are rejected to keep them in existence so he can punish
them

In a short poem God in His mercy made  the fixed pains of Hell
C S Lewis expresses an idea that I'm sure was current among others
but I haven't be able to find its source

that even Hell is an expression of mercy because God limits the amount
of separation from Him and hence the amount of agony that one can
achieve

The two historic facts that I think the most important are these

 If Jesus didn't rise from the dead then he must have done something
else equally impressive in order to create the observed amount of impact

 Nobody ever displayed the dead body of Jesus even though both the
Jewish and the Roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so
it would have discredited the Christians

 The WITNESS Of The LORD JESUS CHRIST

Mark  And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer
     many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests
     and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again
                                         
Mark  For He was teaching His disciples and telling them The Son
     of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men and they will
     kill Him and when He has been killed He will rise three days
     later                                
     
Mark  And they will mock Him and spit upon Him and scourge Him
     and kill Him and three days later He will rise again
                       
Mark  But regarding the fact that the dead rise again have you
     not read in the book of Moses in the passage about the burning
     bush how God spoke to him saying 'I am the God of Abraham and
     the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'

Luke  and after they have scourged Him they will kill Him and
     the third day He will rise again 
     
Luke  and He said to them Thus it is written that the Christ
     should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day
     
John  Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life he
     who believes in Me shall live even if he dies

John  For as yet they did not understand the Scripture that He
     must rise again from the dead                              
     
Acts  explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to
     suffer and rise again from the dead and saying This Jesus whom
     I am proclaiming to you is the Christ

 The WITNESS Of The APOSTLE PAUL   Corinthians 

  Now I make known to you brethren the gospel which I preached to
   you which also you received in which also you stand

  by which also you are saved if you hold fast the word which I
   preached to you unless you believed in vain

  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received
   that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures

  and that He was buried and that He was raised on the third day
   according to the Scriptures     

  and that He appeared to Cephas then to the twelve

  After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one
   time most of whom remain until now but some have fallen asleep

  then He appeared to James then to all the apostles

  and last of all as it were to one untimely born He appeared to me
   also

  For I am the least of the apostles who am not fit to be called an
   apostle because I persecuted the church of God

 But by the grace of God I am what I am and His grace toward me did
   not prove vain but I labored even more than all of them yet not I
   but the grace of God with me

 Whether then it was I or they so we preach and so you believed

 Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead
   how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead

 But if there is no resurrection of the dead not even Christ has
   been raised

 and if Christ has not been raised then our preaching is vain your
   faith also is vain

 Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God because we
   witnessed against God that He raised Christ whom He did not raise
   if in fact the dead are not raised

 For if the dead are not raised not even Christ has been raised

 and if Christ has not been raised your faith is worthless you are
   still in your sins

 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished

 If we have hoped in Christ in this life only we are of all men most
   to be pitied

 BUT NOW CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD the first fruits of
   those who are asleep

 For since by a man came death by a man also came the resurrection
   of the dead

 For as in Adam all die so also in Christ all shall be made alive

 But each in his own order Christ the first fruits after that those
   who are Christ's at His coming

 then comes the end when He delivers up the kingdom to the God and
   Father when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power

 For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet

 The last enemy that will be abolished is death


             LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION

              Jesus's enemies would not have stolen His
                body because that would have perpetrated the
                resurrectionthe very opposite of what they
                desired

              Jesus' disciples could not have stolen His
                body because Pontius Pilate established guards
                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be
                stolen

              Sadly and ironically many of Jesus' disciples
                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus
                had risen from the dead

              In nearly  centuries no body has ever been
                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He
                would indeed rise from the dead

              The probability of being able to perpetrate such
                a hoax successfully upon the entire world for
                nearly  centuries is astronomically negative

jemurraymagnusacsohiostateedu John E Murray writes

I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my
wife and me lately liturgy in particular Catholic liturgy  In the last few
years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass  It's
driving me crazy  The most gracefilled aspect of a liturgical tradition is
that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how 
to do it  Led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we 
present to God  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers

    

Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the s and s as the
Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting
their rosary beads during Mass I find this comment interesting  There
is a massively longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts
without active participation  If you know the Latin one really
beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three
deacons  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range Jesus chants
in the bass and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor
This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion
that John would prefer

But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations
Each pastor makes his own decisions it isn't a churchwide conspiracy
against participation  The Palm Sunday liturgy with its initial
blessing and distribution of the palms and procession is already
getting long before you get to the Passion some pastors feel that they
should not make the people stand through that long narrative  Also the
orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation
in the crowd quotations runs longer than the singlereader proclamation
 in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday it might be
necessary to go with the briefer options just to get 'em in and get 'em
out

Each parish is different  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to
their geographic parishes  It is possible that another Catholic parish
in the Columbus area based on the Ohio State address has a liturgy
closer to your preferences  Or talk to some of your fellow
parishioners and see how common your preferences are  pastors
generally ARE willing to listen to nonconfrontational requests  Though
you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly
to the shock of people asked for a longer Sunday Mass

Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow
the continuous evolution model the accumulation of small changes no
single one of which is too hard to take but rather the punctuated
equilibrium model things stay the same and we get accustomed to them
then the marked mutation hits  My apologies if I am misremembering
the names of the evolutionary theories

Many Christians believe in abstinence but in a moment will be overcome
by desire  We all compromise and rationalize poor choices sin  Last
week I was guilty of anger jealousy and whole mess of other stuff
yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with AIDs  To even
suggest that AIDS is deserved is ludicrous

When man was told not to have sex with relatives did they listen 
NO And man found out why 

So what's your point  Mark's comment still is valid  To suggest that
AIDS is deserved IS ludicrous  I sin  I can resolve to abstain from 
sin and do weekly more often actually  Yet I routinely fail
I surely do deserve what I get yet God compassionately provided 
the Incarnate Logos Jesus as a rememdy and a way out of our situation
If AIDS is deserved I surely deserve instant death just as much as do
we all as St Paul so cogently remids us

To willingly judge others as deserving punishment seems to me
to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility  
 
I wonder if AIDS would be a problem now if people didn't get
involved in deviant sexual behaviour Certainly people who
received tainted blood are not to blame But it just goes
to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few

So what's the point here  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in
deviant sexual behavior  In fact I could engage in LOTS
of deviant sexual behavior with HIV people and never be
infected  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors
many of which are not sexual  And not all sexual behaviors

In addition IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things
There is still the matter of atonement Is it AIDS 
I don't know

The end of all things is to know love and serve God growing
daily closer through prayer meditation and discipline  Even so
I could get AIDS  Anyone could unless they remain forever celibate

Yes it's important to realize that all actions have consequences
and that rules were made for our own good  But to suggest that a
disease is a punishment for certain types of sin I think is 
taking things much too far  
text deleted
Yes sin can have terrible consequences but we need to be real
careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for 
sin  

I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions
I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a punishment for certain
types of sin this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to
here  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that
curses will come on you and others  Although one definition of 'curse'
is 'retribution' I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the
word  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his
Bible  God doesn't cause curses he warns us of them

Kevin Davis wrote a while ago
Last week I was guilty of anger jealousy and whole mess of
other stuff yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with
AIDs  To even suggest that AIDS is deserved is ludicrous

The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death which is
much worse than AIDS  we have all hurt God with our sin

Paul Conditt reveals his feelings
In case you couldn't tell I get extremely angry and upset when
I see things like this  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and
phobias we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other
socially unacceptable diseases  Whether they got the disease through
their own actions or not is irrelevant  They still need Jesus

The first issue you bring up is your anger  It is obviously wrong to
be angry Gal  for any reason especially extremely angry
which is on par with hatred  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us
for putting him on the cross with our sin yet his prayer was forgive
them Father they know not what they do  Knowing how forgiving Jesus
has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of
love for Him  Please don't give in to anger it will only cause
foolish quarrels and more bad feelings

It's okay if you read something that bothers you but you need to
address it in a loving way  If right now I felt like someone out
there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with
AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would
frame a response something like this

It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS which is
simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other is God's punishment
for people who have committed certain sins  God loves all of his
children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him  We
will all be judged after we die but until then we all have the
opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with
all of our hearts believing the gospel's testimony repenting of our
sin confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism and living a new life
for him
 Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned  God's arm is not
to short to save  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart
or a misled person  He works for the good of all men  Even through
the worst of situations he has set the times and places for all men
that they may perhaps reach out and find him

The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears
of people with AIDS  Fortunately what you describe as seeing is
actually misperceiving  You have been missing the points made in the
earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been
expressed  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your
perceptions but please try to be openminded

You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people
because they all need Jesus  This is what my brothers and sisters and
I do on a daily basis  If you would like to send me the name of the
city and state you live in I will find and get you in touch with some
brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so
that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself

The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual
contracted AIDS  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their
salvation in that there may be repetence involved

The important point to be made however is that not listening to God's
commands or advice or warnings ie sinning causes harm or
misfortune to yourself and others  For this reason a good way to
prevent the misfortune of AIDS which can be transmitted in sinful ways
is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or
husband

I hope that you are feeling better now Paul

Love

Eventually we got around to how
we should pray in Jesus' name  Then an excellent question came up one
that I don't have a real answer to  The question was If we need to pray
in Jesus' name what about the people before Jesus  They prayed to God
and he listened then in spite of their sins  Why can't it be the same
way now

	And in that day you will ask Me no question  Truly truly I say to 
	you if you shall ask the Father for anything He will give it to you 
	in my name  Until now you have asked for nothing in My name ask and 
	you will receive that your joy may be made full
				John 

I don't believe that we necessarily have to say     In Christ's name  
Amen for our prayers to be heard but it glorifies the Son when we 
acknowledge that our prayer is made possible by Him  I believe that just as 
those who were saved in the OT could only be saved because Jesus would one day
reconcile God to man He is the only reason their prayers would be heard by 
God

	For all of us have become like one who is unclean
	And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment
	And all of us wither like a leaf
	and our iniquities like the wind take us away
				Isaiah  NAS

Our prayers like the rest of our deeds are too unholy to go directly to the
Father because they are tainted by our sin  Only by washing these prayers with
Christ's blood are they worthy to be lifted to to the Father

	First I thank my God through Christ Jesus   
				Romans  NAS

Some scholars believe that this is Paul recognizing that even his thanks are 
too unholy for the Father
	Basically prayer is a gift of grace I believe that only through Jesus
do our prayers have any power thus praying in His name glorifies and praises 
Jesus for this beautiful and powerful gift He has given us

 Since thedayuponwhichmostChristianscelebratetheresurrectionofJesus
 is approaching I thought I would comment on this
 
 In article Marathosrutgersedu dsegardnyxcsduedu Daniel Segard writes
 
 What is the objection to celebration of Easter  It is celebration of the
 resurrection of Jesus  I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to
 celebrate the resurrection but it is the sole and only reason that we
 are Christianshow could we not celebrate it  If it is only the name

Not quite correct  Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the
resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized
 Col Buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him
through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the
dead  Rom Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death
that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
Father even so we also should walk in newness of life
Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in
newness of life after baptism  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan
goddess in the process

       So as we see from Scripture those who are of Israel will observe
 the th Day FOREVER  The Gentiles who believe in the Messiah of Israel
 are welcome to observe the th Day as well but it is not required of them
 since the are adopted into the Commonwealth of Israel  The Gentiles who
 are grafted into the Commonwealth of Israel are only required to observe
 the basic commands given to those who came before Abram see also Acts
   No further requirements are placed upon them once they come to faith
 in Messiah
  
 So from this I infer that there are different rules for Christians of Jewish
 descent  What happened to there is neither Jew nor Greek slave nor free
 male nor female for all are one in Christ Jesus  Jewish ChristiansMessianics
 may find certain forms of worship and certain disciplines meaningful because
 of their cultural background but I have a hard time understanding the 
 justification for applying rules or commandments to those who have been 
 justified by grace through faith in Jesus Christ
 
Paul answered your question in Romans   In v  he stated that the
adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of
God and the promises were given to the Israelites  It is a package deal
 He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites  Vs  makes it
plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but
those who accept the promise of God  Paul continued to emphasize that he
was an Israelite in  Cor  then in Gal  he says that all those
who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed and heirs to all the promises
given to the Israelites  The promises come with the law  It is all or
nothing  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law 
Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you  Or do you
believe that adultery is no longer forbidden  Same law

BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only
required to observe the basis commandmants  Could you list those
please  Acts  deals with circumcision and the law of Moses which was
added because of transgression of God's eternal law Gal  Rom

In article Aprathosrutgersedu writes

 I can only reply with what it says in  Timothy  

I'm not here to discount parts of the Bible  Rather I'm
     here only to discount the notion of revelation
     The author of  Timothy told what he thought was the
     truth based on his belief in God his faith in Jesus
     as the resurrected Son and his readings of the Old
     Testament  But again what had been revealed to him
     was based on at best secondhand information given
     by friends and authors who may not have given the
     whole truth or who may have exaggerated a bit
 
First of all the original poster misquoted  The reference is from  Tim 
The author was Paul and his revelations were anything but at best 
secondhand

	And is came about that as Saul journeyed he was approaching
	 Damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him and
	 he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul
	 why are you persecuting Me  And he said Who art Thou Lord  And
	 He said I am Jesus whom you are persecuting   
		Acts  NAS

Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus  Pretty cool eh  He
became closely involved with the early church the leaders of which were 
followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth

Now you may say The Holy Spirit revealed these things
     unto him and we could go into that argument but
     you'd be hardpressed to convince me that the Holy
     Spirit exists  

I agree  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you 
the Spirit exists  Please don't complain about this being circular  I know
it is but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural
This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible

     Additionally what he has written is
     again secondhand info if it were given by the Spirit
     and still carries the chance it is not true

The Spirit is part of God  How much closer to the source can you get
The Greek in  Timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by God 
literally means Godbreathed  In other words God spoke the actual words 
into the scriptures  Many theologians and Bible scholars Dr James Boice is 
one that I can remember offhand get quite annoyed by the dryness and 
incompleteness of inspired by God

The only way you would be able to escape this notion of
     secondhand info is to have had the entire Bible
     written by God himself  And to tell the truth I've
     studied the Bible extensively and have yet to 
     hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence
     showing God as the first author of this collection of
     books

That's what the verse taken from  Timothy was all about  The continuity of a 
book written over a span of  years by more than  authors from all walks 
of life is a testimony to the single authorship of God

 And as for reason read what it says in  Corinthians  about
 human wisdom Basically it says that human wisdom is useless when
 compared with what God has written for our learning

If you knew of Jesus as well as you know the Bible you'd
     realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for 
     the common man  

What source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior
historicity to the Bible  Certainly not Josephus' writings or the writings 
of the Gnostics which were third century at the earliest

     And though some claim Jesus was 
     he was human with all of the human wisdom the
     apostle Paul set out to criticize  Yet would you not
     embrace the idea that Jesus was wise

Jesus was fully God as well  That's why I'd assert that he is wise

 I realise that you may not accept the authority of the Bible This is
 unfortunate to say the least because there is no other way of learning
 about God and Christ and God's purpose with the earth than reading the
 Bible and searching out its truth for yourself

For your information I was raised without any knowledge of
     God  By the time some of the faithful came to show me
     the Word and share with me its truth I was living
     happily and morally without acknowledging the existence
     of a supreme being  I have though read the Bible
     several times over in its entirety and have studied it
     thoroughly  It contains truth in it and I consider
     Jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to
     have lived in fact I darnnear idolize the guy  But
     there's no rational reason for me to except God's
     existence

Please rethink this last paragraph  If there is no God which seems to be your
current belief then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not
only did he assert that God exists but he claimed to be God himself  regards
to CS Lewis  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus
	In conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based
on gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims  
The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out
	About your reading of the Bible not only does the Spirit inspire the
writers but he guides the reader as well  We cannot understand it in the 
least without the Spirit's guidance

	For to us God revealed them through the Spirit for the Spirit 
	searches all things even the depths of God   Cor  NAS
 
Peace and may God guide us in wisdom

Other theologians get quite annoyed at the misleadingess of
Godbreathed  It's true that the Greek word has as its roots God
and breath  However etymology doesn't necessarily tell you what a
word means  Otherwise goodbye would be a religious expression
since it comes from God be with ye  You have to look at how the
word was actually used  In this case the word is used for wisdom or
dreams that come from God  But Godbreathed is an overtranslation

He doesn't contradict himself  The church is to last for all time
However there are those who use the church to bolster themselves  This
is evident in many letters  For instance Paul talks about the
superapostles to the Corinthians  Corinthians  he mentions
how people will be led away by miracles signs and wonders 
Thessalonians  he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will
abandon the faith and teach lies  Timothy  and that some will
search for teachers to suit what they want to hear  Timothy 
Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them
Matthew   But look at the promise in this last part  Verse
  And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world
as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come  Even today
there are false teachings  I can name two which I am well familiar
with  the nonneed of baptism and the praying of Jesus into your life
for salvation  Both are taught  Both are DEAD wrong  They have been
taken out of context from some verses interpreted from others and just
plain made up  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke  and
Luke   He then commands baptism in Matthew   The
church Jesus founded though is alive and well  It's not being
persecuted as much as back then the laws won't allow it yet but it is
being persecuted

Verses
    Corinthians 
   Colossians 

As for knowing when that's a bit tricky  People normally have
consciences which warn them about it  However as in my case a
conscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness Hebrews  so
that the person has no idea or doesn't care about it that they are
sinning  Of course there are those sins which we do when we don't know
that they're sinful to begin with  Those take searching and examining
of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and
change  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful
possibilities is  Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in
time  I know it sounds like a copout but it truly is a stifling
question

Hello fellownetters and fellow christians
about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches
to a bible study group Alltough I do have a personal opinion on this
issue I thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian
brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations

My background member of a orthodox Reformed Church Let us say a little
The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are
disciples  I came out of a church in which even the different
congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was
better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything
into practice from those messages  Since becoming a disciple I've
found that when I travel to another church in the same movement they
are just as accepting there as any other  We had a retreat back in
January when some of the congregation from Louisville KY came up this
retreat was for college students and it was as though I had known even
the people from Louisville for years and I had only become a disciple
the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky  One
of the keys to unity is unselfish love and selfsacrifice  That is only
one area in which disciples stand out from Christians  Also another
part of unity is a common depth of conviction  I've also been a part of
some Christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between
churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved  a lack of
conviction about everything they believed  That was why they could be
unified they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along
together

The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches
denominations with the same characteristics Both have the same
confessions there are only some differences with respect to  for
example  the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use
our creeds In essence a lot of people of these three churches have to
same faith and feel that they should become one church But how that is
the question

Creeds  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly
better

So here is a first question
 can the congregation of Christ be separated by walls of different
  denominations Or is this definitely an untolerable situation
  according to the Scriptures

According to the Scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going
to be there  As per a previous note I mentioned that there are those
who teach falsely by many means  There are also differences of opinion
and belief  However Scripture states  
   In the following directives I have no praise for you for your
meetings do more harm than good  In the first place I hear that when
you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some
extent I believe it  No doubt there have to be differences among you to
show which of you have God's approval  Corinthians 

How will God show his approval  By fruitfulness see Acts  but
before that there are these qualities
   devotion to the apostles teaching
   fellowship
   communion
   filling with awe for God
   all having everything in common
   glad and sincere hearts
   praising God
   enjoying the favor of the people
All these are mentioned in Acts   God also shows that those who
have these qualities are persecuted  Look at Stephen a man full of
faith and of the Holy Spirit Acts  who was later stoned Acts
  

 can one say that only one of these three churches is the
  true church of Jesus Christ

One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is
perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement  I
have yet to find that but the closest one I've found is the Boston
Church of Christ movement which constantly strives to have errors
pointed out and corrected  It is also the only one I've seen which is
totally sold out to God


A problem closely related to these question is
 can we cooperate with other Christians  from these two churches  
  before there is a unity This question is especially important
  for those who think that only one church can be the true one

As for cooperation that can always occur  Unity on the other hand may
never occur  As for those who think about only one church being the
true one I remind them that Mark  states that there are
disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they
will not lose their reward  As with the Boston movement I've heard
numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there
that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them
any less disciples  Of course few people admit that they've ever run
into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement
I know I haven't

Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you
For your information we have a lot of organizations here which
are founded by people of one specific church and whose members
are all members of that church This has been considered as
correct for years Only a few years ago people started to
discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process
Some organizations are opening their doors for people from
other churches etc

I must warn that this sounds cliquey to me  A clique is a group which
runs around together to some extent exclusively  This causes problems
in fellowship and causes divisions  I would not say at all that this is
something correct for a churchgroup to do for any reason  In one of
the churches I attended for example there was an internal clique of
people who were on the  different groupscommitteesorganizational
heads of the congregation  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of
the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another
office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in
Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he
nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch I wish he
would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a
disciple  Anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be
broken down but is still there  So I must warn against such division
within  There's enough division without

Thanks for your opinions in advance

Were the early Christians weird  Yes  So were their nonChristian
contemporaries the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome
or the Pricipate the weirder those people will seem  forget the
creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero
worship  So are modern nonChristians  And Christians

You are pretty weird yourself with your rather acid dismissal of
Luther and of Protestantism  and in apparently buying into a
simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism not being faddish  
Sure it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they
do in smaller denominations and local ones are not usually visible
unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands   May I recom
mend as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries' book
The Hour of our Death a longitudinal study of death customs in 
Western specifically Catholic Christendom

And it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian
century  Paul was pretty weird too as were Peter and the others in
the apparently quite weird circle around Jesus

What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity  try to
understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love
you would expect others to show YOUR notions  We are commanded to
love one another after all  And Brown's book is in fact a heroic
attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and
the gospel and their social contexts  If anything Brown is too
heroic here  he manages to overstrain himself at times 

I don't suggest that we follow any of these old cult paths  and
it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of
early Christianity was like the weird Christian and nonChristian
cults we see today  To that extent I think you raise a serious
problem and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly selfdeprecatory
and ironic

But the first principle for answering these questions is respect and
love for those we do not understand  And it helps to work at under
standing as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin
to withdraw our respect for them as people  I would advise in other
words MORE historical reading Brown's other books are also good most
especially his bio of Augustine also try Robin Lane Fox's Christians
and Pagans maybe the Paul Veyne ed History of Private Life some
of Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world 

Humanity is weird  we have known ONE sane person and we killed Him
Fortunately for us this has proved a Comedy rather than a Tragedy

Easter 

yes this is a tad early  our Vigil service here has been moved forward
because so many churches in the area have taken to doing their own Vigils
and the seminarians must therefore worshipandrun if they are to do it
here and there as well  Think of this as an Anglican fad

 DC Also what is Orthodox practice regarding communion  I read
 DC a throwaway remark someplace that the Orthodox receive less
 DC frequently than Catholics do but was is their current practice
 DC Have their been any variations historically

I think Orthodox practice varies from place to place from parish to parish and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants ie children under
  In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before and that one will have been fasting As we have to travel km to the church we don'
t receive communion every Sunday but about every third Sunday

  We suspect that's because one party to the environmental
  dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified  It's clear that much
  of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been
  called the Religious Left a SECULAR or even PAGAN fanaticism
  that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a
  reverence formerly accorded real religions  EMPHASIS MINE

 SHK First of all secular and pagan are not synonyms  Pagan which is
 SHK derived from the latin paganus means of the country  It is in
 SHK fact a cognate with the Italian paisano which means peasant
 SHK Paganism among other things includes a reverence for the planet and
 SHK all life on the planet  stemming from the belief that all life is
 SHK interconnected  So rather than be something secular it is something
 SHK very sacred

I would go further and say that much of the damage to the environment
has been caused by the secular worldview or by the humanist
worldview and especially by the secular humanist worldview

This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid
destroyers of the environment and I am sure that there are many who
are concerned about the environment But at the time of the
Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre
or the focus of culture hence humanism This consciousness was
also secular in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the
present age r ather than the age to come Capitalism arose at the
same time and the power of economics became central in philosophy
This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before simply that it
began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European
society and its offshoots This cultural shift was in its later
stages accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that
justified
 them

There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of economics 
from the Christian view of man as the economos the steward of
creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces
and powers There were denominational differences among the new
worshippers of Mammon For some the name of the deity was the free
rein of the market mechanism while for others it was the
dialectical forces of history But in both the capitalist West and
the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of
Mammon The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who
were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to
oppose what was happening and state their case

If I talk with an atheist and tell him the New Testament is an historically 
reliable document what reasons would I give him

  I have found that this isn't a very effective argument  Most atheists are
perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesusbut are
quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into 
misunderstandings hoaxes or simple fabrications  They can always make an
analogy with the Iliad a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan
War but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations
  I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of 
Christianity through argument  We have to help foster faith and an
understanding of God  I could be wrongare there any former atheists here who
were led to Christianity by argument

 Biblical prophecy tends to be somewhat cyclical  For example the virgin
 prophecy of Isaiah also prophecied of Christ  How does this apply to the 
 book of Revelation in regard to the perterist view

Much of the OT prophecies have a double application to the Jewish
captivity and to the end of time  But if Rev is dated at AD its
prophecies could not apply to the AD destructioin of Jerusalem

I am doing a dormitory bible discussion with my Christian roommate and
in Jesus' name what about the people before Jesus  They prayed to God
and he listened then in spite of their sins  Why can't it be the same
way now


insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little
relevance to what I've found

OK  The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus right so far I've
announced that space is a vacuum  The people who lived during the time
Jesus lived especially disciples were taught this  I tell you the
truth anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing  He
will do even greater things than these because I am going to the
Father  And I will do whatever you ask in my name so that the Son may
bring glory to the Father  You may ask me for anything in my name and
I will do it John 
So Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name  Since that time
the request has been the same not to ask for intercession from other
beings but from Jesus  Remember that there is one God and one
mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself as
a ransom for all menthe testimony given in its proper time 
Timothy   Also there have been many of those priests talking
about priests among the Hebrews since death prevented them from
continuing in office but because Jesus lives forever he has a
permanent priesthood  Therefore he is able to save completely those who
come to God through him because he always lives to intercede for them
Hebrews   Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus
being our mediator rather than any other man

Joe Fisher

The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus right may not be as
obvious as you think  In what sense to you mean didn't have
Christian thought has generally said that they had Jesus in the sense
that they were saved by his death  God is not bound by our
chronology  So in some real spiritual sense they did have Jesus
Even in terms of knowledge while they surely didn't have the explicit
knowledge that we have Christians have normally seen messianic
prophecy as knowledge of Jesus even if knowledge from afar

                   THE EMPTY TOMB  CAN WE TRUST IT

                   by the late Wilbur M Smith DD
                              

          When Jesus was on Earth He made an amazing prediction about
     Himself and frequently repeated it  Let me quote it for you

                 Behold we go up to Jerusalem and the Son
               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief
               priests and unto the scribes and they shall
               condemn Him to death and shall deliver Him
               to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and
               to crucify Him and the third day He shall
               rise again Matthew 

          Wholly different from the normal experience of men Jesus
     who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving
     reproval knew He would die before He was  years of age  He
     knew the very city where He would die  He knew that the religious
     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death  He knew that
     one of His own would betray Him  He knew that before His actual
     death took place He would be mocked and scourged  He knew exactly
     how He would dieby crucifixion

          All this is in itself remarkable  But more amazing than the
     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted
     would follow shortly after He was buriedthat He would rise
     again  He even designated the timeon the third day

          But since it is on this central factthe death and resurrec
     tion of Jesus Christthat the whole truth or untruth of Chris
     tianity turns let us examine it more closely

          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth
     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and
     ointments was distributed  The body was placed in a tomb which
     had never before been used and a great stone was rolled against
     the entrance  The Jewish authorities fully aware that Jesus had
     predicted He would rise again had the stone officially sealed and
     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the
     disciples from carrying away the body  Early Sunday morning some
     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the
     tomb to further anoint the body  To their utter astonishment
     they found the stone rolled away the body gone  They rushed back
     to tell the disciples  Shortly two of Jesus' friends Peter and
     John utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the
     tomb empty just as the women had said  Even the guards came
     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them
     to guard the tomb that the body was gone Matthew 

          How did this tomb become empty

          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America
     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological
     seminarywrote to the author in answer to my question of how
     the tomb became empty and wrote it in a letter not marked by
     bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb
     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the
     chimney at Christmas time

          But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down
     any chimney at Christmas time because there never was a Santa
     Claus  And there is a Jesus  He died He was buried in the
     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea and on Sunday the body was gone

          Those are facts of history  No one can escape the responsi
     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by
     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old

          Another professor Dr Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University
     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar
     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt
     that the women went to the wrong tomb

          The facts are these

          First so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to
     which by mistake they could have gone

          Second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or
     more people to forget the place where they have buried their
     dearest loved one within less than three days  Even if the women
     did miss the tomb when Peter and John came did they too go to
     the wrong tomb

          Third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb

          There is of course a record of an attempt to escape the
     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself

                  Now when they were going behold some
               of the watch came into the city and showed
               unto the chief priests all the things that
               were done  And when they were assembled
               with the leaders and had taken counsel they
               gave large money unto the soldiers Saying
               Say ye His disciples came by night and stole
               Him away while we slept  And if this come to
               the governor's ears we will persuade him and
               secure you  So they took the money and did
               as they were taught  and this saying is com
               monly reported among the Jews until this day
               Matthew 

          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the
     fact that the tomb was empty

          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never
     questioned but that the tomb was empty  They never even went out to
     see if what the guards had reported was truethey knew it was true

          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that
     the tomb was emptythe soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples
     came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep

          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep
     Obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court

          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject
     the explanation the very character and the later history of the
     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away
     the body of Jesus

          First as Professor Heffern points out the leaders of Judaism in
     Jerusalem who had put the Lord Jesus to death had nothing to offer to
     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His
     resurrectionbecause all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty  If there
     had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected
     then proved

          Second surely one of the disciples even most of them would
     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent
     It may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lieand most
     of these men did

          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ
     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded storiesit
     would have lost it power  Instead this truth swept the world closed
     pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to a despairing
     humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today
     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever

          But not only did Jesus come alive again He did not disappear to
     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to
     what had happened to Him

          Instead He appeared to themliterally visibly frequently

          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning
     Matthew  later that day to Mary Magdalene alone John 
      and to Simon Peter also alone Luke   In the afternoon He
     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus Luke  and that
     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper
     room at Jerusalem Mark  Luke  etc

          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at
     the same place John   Once He was seen by above  brethren
     on a mountain in Galilee I Corinthians  and finally to the
     apostles just before His ascension Mark  Luke  Acts 
     

          As with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor
     ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed
     attempting to deny their literalness  But these theories are
     unreasonable without supporting evidence  None has ever won the
     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the
     appearances

          Moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our
     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are
     antisuperanaturalistic let us not forget that some of the greatest
     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle
     Increase Mather president of Harvard Timothy Dwight president of Yale
     Nathan Lord president of Dartmouth Edward Hitchcock president of
     Amherst Mark Hopkins president of Williams John Witherspoon president
     of Princetonthese men and countless others have believed it

          But suppose Christ did rise from the dead what of it  What has
     it to do with my life  What has it to do with your life  Just this
     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ

          Jesus taught many great truthsespecially many about Himself  He
     claimed to have come down from God

          He said He was the way to God

          He said He was the Son of God who alone knew God perfectly

          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life and no one
     else had it

          He said that whatever we ask God in His name He would grant it to
     us

          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day He revealed
     that in these amazing unparalleled predictions He spoke the truth

          Do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe
     that His words are all true

          The point is does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us
     that He is none other than the One He claimed to bethe Son of God

          And then of course the fact that Christ rose from the dead
     testifies that He has broken the power of death and that He will some
     day raise us also up from the grave as He promised

          In other words if this Person Jesus Christ the Son of God in all
     this He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life  For
     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins His compan
     ionship and help a joy that no circumstances can ever take away and a
     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day

          Those who have tried it down through the agesand there have been
     manyhave given their testimony  And we today who believe also know

We can jillustrate this by pointing to the way God administers His judgment 
In the OT sins were not forgiven but rather covered up  In the age of the
Church not only are sins forgiven taken away but the power of SIN is put to
death  

My this distinction seems quite arbitrary

  Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven whose sin is covered
  Ps 

and quoted by the apostle Paul

  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God
  imputeth righteousness without works
  Saying Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
  are covered
  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin  Rom 

The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are
parallelequivalent concepts in both testaments  The dispensational
distinction is unwarranted

        During the millenium we read that sins are dealt with immediately
under the present ie that Christ is present on earth rulership of Christ

I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up  You're suggesting Jesus is
going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law  for
millions perhaps billions of people  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver
was considered unwise cf Ex ff  It makes for interesting
speculation though

I'll leave comments on the socalled bema seat vs throne judgments to
someone else  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala
dispensationalism

Adam I just finished a study on this not only looking at the
prophecies themselves but where they were fulfilled  While going only
through the OT I found  references  After starting to show their
fulfillment I found out that I had missed some so needless to say I
cannot post them here  However the study I did I intend to publish I
am in the process of organizing and showing the fulfillments then I
will be ready to write and send it to a publisher  With any luck
andor free time I should have it finally done sometime around
September I hope

Especially as we approach a time when Scientists are trying to match God's 
ability to create life we should use the utmost caution

  I question the implications of this statement namely that there are certain
physical acts which are limited to God and that attempting to replicate these
acts is blasphemy against God  God caused a bush to burn without being
consumedif I do the same thing am I usurping God's role  
  Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically
removing the physical proofs of God's existence  As time goes on we have to
rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase
science is removing our props  I don't think this is a bad thing

does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the
environment being turned unintentionally of course into
pantheism

I've debated this quite a bit and while I think a legitimate
concern for the planet is a great thing I can easily see it
being perverted into something dangerous

  Many pagans are involved in environmentalismthis is only natural since
respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations  This
doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong any more than supporting peace in
the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it

  Nonetheless paganism is certainly on the rise and we as Christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity  Like
it or not pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be
and isn't  
  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has
forgotten  This doesn't mean that paganism is right but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement
  First paganism respects the feminine  Christianity has a long history of
oppressing women and many if not most male Christians are still unable to
live in a nonsexist manner  The idea that God is sexless or that Christ 
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission is met with a great
deal of resistance  This insistance on a maledominated theology and the 
maledominated society that goes with it drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches
  Second paganism respects the physical world  This is an idea with great
ramifications  One of these is environmentalismrespect for our surroundings
and our world  Another is integration of sexuality  Christianity has a long
tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality  This is too muchsex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option  
Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic and paganism
is an attractive option
  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines no sex before marriage etc
should be changedjust that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality and neither one does much to bring us closer to God

  Here's how I talk to nonChristians who are complaining about Hell

ME	Do you believe you're going to Heaven
HIM	I don't believe in Heaven
ME	So are you going there
HIM	If there was a heaven I would
ME	But since there isn't a Heaven you're not going there are you
HIM	No

  The point is that Heaven is based on faithif you don't believe in heaven
there's no way you're going to be in it
  Of course the next step is I don't believe in Hell either so why will I
be there  It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God
Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever and never
see Godso they do in fact believe that they're going to Hell
  Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hellbecause it's eternal 
and it's a lot worse than Heaven  That's the only comparison that matters

I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance of
Christians and look forward to any responses  In my
encounters with Christians I find myself dismayed by their
belief that their faith is total truth  According to them
their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of
God and God is truth  thus they know the truth  This stance
makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own
hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way
Their way is the 'truth'

But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe
a particular way  That choice is part faith and part reason
but it seems to me a choice

My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard
discussions when I was in grade school

A kid would say All policemen are jerks  I'd ask How do
you know  Because my daddy told me so  How do you know
you're daddy is right  He says he's always right

Well the argument usually stops right there  In the end
aren't we all just kids groping for the truth  If so do we have
the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as
false



This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup  I
apologize if I'm covering tired old ground  Some of the
discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome
any comments

I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this  I
can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough
evidence to believe it or that there's just as good evidence for
other religions  I don't agree but clearly there are plenty of
intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing  But that
doesn't seem to be your point  Rather you seem upset that people who
believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict
it are false

This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than
the Christian one  It sounds more like an existentialist view where
people choose what value to follow but there's no actual independent
spiritual reality and so no way to say that a specific choice is in
some unique sense right  This sort of model  with modifications of
one sort or another  may be appropriate for some religions  But
Christianity is in its essense a historical religion  That is it's
based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out
there that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways
and that we see evidence of that in history  In the mundane world
we are not free to choose how things work  When we drop something it
falls aside from welldefined situations where it doesn't  The
Christian concept is that spiritual matters there is also an actual
external reality  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we
have perfect understanding  But while we may not think we know
everything we are confident that we know some things  And that
implies that we think things that contradict them are false  I don't
see how else we could proceed

This needn't result in arrogance  I'm certainly interested in talking
with people of other religions  They may have things to teach me and
even if they don't I respect them as fellow human beings  But it's
got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some
matters they are wrong  Maybe even disasterously wrong

phillaunchburyalmaccouk Phil Launchbury writes

 The apostate church of Revelation most likely refers to the st century
 Jews who rejected their Messiah and had Him crucified  John refers to them

 I'm afraid not It refers to the church that Christ founded Many many
 times he warns that the church will fall away into heresy as do the
 apostles For an example look at the parables in Matthew  They
 refer to 'the kingdom of heaven' the church and the process of how
 they will be corrupted

Sorry but I think this interpretation of the Matthew  parables is
nonsense Ie

 'yeast'  ALWAYS stands for sincorruptionheresy For example 'beware
 of the yeast of the Pharisees' 

Matthew  explains that by leaven of the Pharisees Jesus was simply
referring to their teaching not sincorruptionheresy

Jesus gaves His apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that
the gates of hell would not prevail against His church

					Pardon me a humble atheist but exactly what is the difference
between holding a revealed truth with blind faith as its basis ie
regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary as an
absolute truth fully expecting people to believe you and arrogance
     They sound like one and the same to me

                                       Pixie


     ps  If you do sincerely believe that a god exists why do you follow
it blindly  

	Why do we follow God so blindly  Have you ever asked a
physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog
The answer is quite simplethe dog can see and the blind person
cannot

	I acknowledge as a Christian that I am blind  I see
but I see  illusions as well as reality  Watched TV lately
I hear but I hear lies as well as truth  Listen to your 
radio or read a newspaper  Remember all that tastes well is
not healthy  So I rely one the one who can see hear and
taste everything and knows what is real and what is not
That is God

	Of course you may ask if I cannot trust my own senses
how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or
a lie  That is why we need faith to be saved  We must force
ourselves to believe that God knows the truth and loves us
enough to share it with us even when it defies what we think
we know  Why would He have created us if He did not love us 
enough to help us through this world

	I also do trust my experiences to some extent  When
I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience 
because it is what my Father commands me to do and I see
the results in the long term I find that He has led me
in the proper direction even though it did not feel right
at the time  This is where our works as Christians are
important  As exercises of the body make the body strong
excercises of faith make the faith strong  

	As for you no one can convert you  You must
choose to follow God of your own will if you are ever to
follow Him  All we as Christians wish to do is share with
you the love we have received from God  If you reject that
we have to accept your decision although we always keep
the offer open to you  If you really want to find out
why we believe what we believe I can only suggest you try
praying for faith reading the Bible and asking Christians
about their experiences personally  Then you may grow to
understand why we believe what we do in defiance of the
logic of this world

	May the Lord bring peace to you

but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the

Yes

I am adamantly an environmentalist  I will not use styrofoam table service
Please keep that in mind as you read this post  I do not wish to attack
environmentalism

A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie  A complete lie will
rarely be readily accepted while a half truth the lie subtly hidden is more
powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light

Satan has for some people loosened the grip on treating the earth as something
other than God's intricate handiwork something other than that on which the
health of future generations is based  It is being treated with respect  You
think he's going to happily leave it at that  No  When one error is rejected
it is his style to push people to the opposite error  Therefore the earth is
not God's intricate handiwork not because it is rubbish but because it is
God  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve

I see two facets of a response to it

 Care for the environment  Treat it with proper respect both because it is
   God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation and because
   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not
   constitute what the Apostle Paul called becoming all things to all men so
   that by all possible means I might save some

   Don't say Forget the environment I've got important things to spend my time
   on  putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your
   credibility in expressing the things that are more important

 Show that it is not the ultimate entity that it is creature and not

   glory  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry but one of many cords

I don't understand who this post is directed towards who are you
trying to convince By its subject i would assume you are directing
the argument towards people who do not believe that Christ rose
from the dead but in your proof you use the bible exclusively

The post is therefore immediately useless to anyone who doesn't
believe that the bible is an unadulterated truth and to everyone
else it is just a reaffirmation of a belief already held As far
as i know there is no disagreement between christians over
the resurrection of christ

so my question is what is the purpose of this post

For all of you found jeezus  how many of you were on the brink

Your very starting point is wrong  Christianity is not based on following
a moral standard  For it is by grace you have been saved through faith
NOT BY WORKS so that no man may boast  Eph   You say that
you know the Bible well and can recognize do you mean recite many

there are a few more passages that you should pay attention to  Titus

Obedience to the moral law is imporant  However it is supposed to be the

 Which brings me around to asking an open question  Is the
 Bible a closed book of Scripture  Is it okay for us to go
 around saying God told me this and Jesus told me that 

 Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies
 are nothing new but rather an inspired translation of
 scripture  Is it right to call that prophecy  Misleading 

Hi You might want to read Charismatic Chaos by John MacArthur  In it
he discussed exactly this queation amongst others  In my own words
VERY simplified his position is basically that one must decide what
is the most important  experience or Scripture  People tend to say
Scripture without living according to that  Their own
feelingprophecyetc tends to be put across without testing in the
light of Scripture

There's a lot more than this really worthwhile to read whether you're

Being a parent in need of some help I ask that you bear with me while I
describe the situation which plagues me

I am a divorced father Chance would have it that my weekend with my 
daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year

Although I am Presbyterian I had married a Catholic woman We decided
that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith
was too confining and restrictive due to time as we had already set a
date and we were married in a Christian Church which was nondenominational

During the years of our marriage we did not often attend church 

When our daughter was born some years later my wife insisted that she 
be baptised as Catholic This wasn't a problem with me

During a separation of five years my exwife was taken ill with a disease
that affected her mental capacities She was confined to a mental ward for
two months before it was diagnosed It has since been treated effectively

In other words professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society

During the recuperation my exwife has embraced Buddism Her influence over
my daughter has been substantial and has primarily allowed me only Saturday
visitation for a number of years During this period I have read Bible study
books to my daughter and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage

Last fall our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings
At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend At that time
I started taking my daughter to church quite often although not every weekend
I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a
religious community

Today Easter Sunday I took my daughter to church When it came time for 
Communion my daughter took the bread The body of Christ but left the wine
The blood of Christ professing that she was too young for wine She then
balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the
pew in front of us

I feel this was a slap in the face to me my religion and an afront to her
religious heritage It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments
if you try I really felt dishonored by the action

My daughter is only nine years old but I think she should have been old and
mature enough to realize her actions I have difficulty blaming her directly
for religious teachings her mother swears to but when I discussed this with
my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity

My initial response of anger moderated was to suggest if there is no faith
in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter or Christmas I suggested I
would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays
with her again

I do not want to drive her from the fold and would be willing to allow her
to continue practicing Buddhism as though I had a choice seeing her only
for two days out of fourteen but I want her to want to embrace Christianity

Any suggestions

If you have a response please email me a copy I'm not a regular reader
of this newsgroup Naturally feel free to post too

Thanks and I hope you've had a happy Easter

 Now as to the suggestion that all prophecy tends to be somewhat cyclical
 can you elaborate  I'm not exactly sure what you mean  How does the
 suggestion relate to Isaiah's prophecy of the birth of Christ by a virgin 
 I don't see any cycles in that prophecy
 
 Maybe cyclical is not the best word  
 
 Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas and his bishoprick
 let another take  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His
 disciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews the children thou
 hast given me
 
 How does the preterist view account for this phenomenon

Ah doublefulfillment  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all
the prophecies had doublefulfillment eg the Isaiah  prophecy

I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean
it will occur always especially with regard to NT prophecies The apostles
who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine
messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church  No one has
that authority today  No one has the apostolic authority to say that
suchandsuch a prophecy has doublefulfillment  If the imagry of
Revelation fits with events of the st century it is folly for us to try
and make it apply to events  centuries later

MODERATOR THIS IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN EARLIER MORE CLUMSILY WORDED
SUBMISSION ON THE SAME TOPIC WHICH I SUBMITTED A FEW MINUTES AGO

I think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning  Regardless of
how the word 'Easter' originated the fact is that it does not now
mean anything to Christians other than 'the feast day of the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ' 

The meaning of a word is only what people understand it to mean

And the same goes for other cultural practices  The festival of Easter
may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival
but today there are as far as I know no Christians who intend to
honor any kind of pagan goddess by celebrating Easter

It is nonsense to say this word or this practice 'really' means so
andso even though nobody realizes it  Words and practices don't mean
things people do  

This is basic semantics I'm a linguist they pay me to think about
things like this

Further Easter is specific to English  In many other languages
the word used is based on Passover or resurrection  Is it OK to
celebrate it in countries using those languages but not in those
using English  clh

	The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for
some time  The problem is in a nutshell this the Liturgy is a
symbolic action  in other words Catholics do or should believe that
the signs during the mass  Water Blessings Vestments Altar
Relics etc  are real That is the sprinkling of water bestows real
almost tangible holiness the Vestments are a real indication of real
sacred time The point of a symbol is that it is understood by all
to be connected to an underlying REAL referent This kind of thinking
precludes analysis holy water is not holy because of anything it
simply IS holy

But modern westerners find it extremely difficult especially if
well educated to think of the mass as a symbol We are more likely
to see it as a sign ie an action that represents grace but which
could be replaced with other signs In concrete terms this means the
mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real
thing You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't
dare with the real thing ask CocaCola Co These attitudes have
been encouraged by Liturgy workshops etc which instead of focusing
on how to do do liturgy have focused on how to create a meaning in
liturgy You can only create signs symbols have to come from God or
the heart or somewhere deeper than analysis The most dramatic
example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of
the sacred species the consecrated host and wine Now with pita
bread etc it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered
in particles If the Host is a sign of Grace this isnt and issue but
Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real
desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body

Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift We
try to perfrom the old rites but then we have some liturgomaniac
priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing  so we stop doing it and
start pretending to do it This is not a soul filling experience
It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and
three chord ersatzfolk music again a result of misanalysis complicated
tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones  this was the
genius of Wesley and the C Anglican hymn writers Taize' is only
slightly better

What are we to do Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it
doesn't work for you Search out a Church where the liturgy is well
prepared not wellexplained They exist in every city This is not BTW
a matter of particular style the music might be old or new It is
the attitude of the church that counts Also note that a conservative
liturgy  harking back to preVatican II days does not necessarily mean
the Church will be socially conservative

In NYC I can recommend
	Corpus Christi  W st St
	Corpus Christi  W st St  very conservative liturgy 
	St Joseph's Greenwich Village   Modern clean largely gay
	Oratorian Church Brooklyn  Very beautiful

Avoid anywhere anytime a church with electric candles

Happy Easter Christos Aneste' Christos Voskrezhne Christ is Risen

  Here's how I talk to nonChristians who are complaining about Hell

ME	Do you believe you're going to Heaven
HIM	I don't believe in Heaven
ME	So are you going there
HIM	If there was a heaven I would
ME	But since there isn't a Heaven you're not going there are you
HIM	No

  The point is that Heaven is based on faithif you don't believe in heaven
there's no way you're going to be in it

    Hmmm people in the americas before the time of Christ children who
die young etc 


  Of course the next step is I don't believe in Hell either so why will I
be there  It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God


   But of course the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect is
something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness at the very least


Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever and never
see Godso they do in fact believe that they're going to Hell

   I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond 
bodily death but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe
they're going to hell They believe they're going to die Understand
that you've turned Hell into a verb Using the same logic it also follows
that all animals are 'going to Hell' Are you sure this is what you want
to say presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven
but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell die
a final death

   I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of some
sort but if Hell is as you described final death and
not eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true that
there will never be a moment when I am aware of my nonexistence 
assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven In other words I'll
never know I'm dead Hmmm 


  Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hellbecause it's eternal

    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill and has died
 At least she's not suffering any more She's in Heaven now 

    Consider the following statement
 At least she's not suffering any more She's in Hell now

    The above statement sounds odd but according to your definition of Hell 
it would be a true statement The person in Hell would not be suffering 
Granted they wouldn't be anything wouldn't be having any
conscious experience whatsoever 

    You say Hell death is eternal However this loses its meaning 
to a dead person And to me it seems that the threat of some sort 
of eternal punishment only makes sensehas force if one expects to
be conscious throughout this eternity 

    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the
product of propaganda Friend do you want the FREE gift of eternal life
It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife
Can anyone back me up on this combined with the survival instinct all
animals share The difference is we have consciousness and once we get the
idea of eternal life drilled into our brains we then desire a sort of
supersurvival 

 
and it's a lot worse than Heaven  That's the only comparison that matters

    That would depend on what Heaven is like If God is a King and 
an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King
I might opt for Hell I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to
convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book The Illusion of Immortality
by Corliss Lamont The missionary started to speak about Heaven 
Are there seals in heaven Will we be able to go hunting asked an
Eskimo The missionary said no The group of Eskimos then said something
to the effect of Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting
Scram I highly recommend the above book IOI to anyone who wants an
account of the other side of the immortality coin that there is no 
immortality

No IMO Mr Stowell missed the point

 	We affirm the absolutes of Scripture not because we are arrogant
 moralists but because we believe in God who is truth who has revealed His
 truth in His Word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance
 of those absolutes

Mr Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes
I don't see how that necessarily follows  

Are all truths also absolutes
Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes

If the answer to either of these questions is no then perhaps you can 
explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths and
which truths are absolutes  

The answer to both questions is yes

All Scripture is true being inspired by God  The evidence for this
claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group

Similarly all truth is absolute  Indeed a nonabsolute truth is a 
contradiction in terms  When is something absolute  When it is always
true  Obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a
contradiction in terms  

Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world  Such a
statement is terribly selfcontradictory  Let me put it to you this
way  If there are no absolutes shouldn't we conclude that the statement
There are no absolutes is not absolutely true  Obviously we have a
contradiction here

This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming
that there are indeed absolutes in the universe

There is hardly consensus even in evangelical 
Christianity not to mention the rest of Christianity regarding 
Biblical interpretation

So  People sometimes disagree about what is true  This does not negate
the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe  Moreover
evangelical Christianity at least still professes to believe in certain
truths  Man is sinful man needs salvation and Jesus is the propitiation
for mankind's sins to name a few  Any group that does not profess to
believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical

The parable of the Prodigal Son is not about who is and who isn't an
immoral person It is about grace and the love of God Most people
would agree with that concerning the younger son The elder son is
simply a negative example of the some thing He thinks that he must
earn his father's love that he has earned it that he is entitled
to it His father tells him that he is on the wrong track He has always
been lovedfor the same reason his brother has always been he is
his father's son

We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point We are
willing to be saved by grace but once we are Christians we want to
go back to earning and deserving

While I will not take the time to rebut you point by point I will suggest
three current works which I think will be helpful in your quest to answer
this question  John Dominic Crossan Professor of Religion at De Paul Univ
The Cross That Spoke Harper and Row Pub  Also his latest work 
The Historical Jesus  The Life of A Mediterranean Jewish Peasant Harper
and Row Pub   Also two works of Burton Mack Professor of New Testament
at the Claremont Graduate School A Myth of Innocence Fortress Press 
And his latest book The Lost Gospel The Book of Q and Christian Origins
Harper and Row   You might start with Mack's book on Q and then 
examine the others afterward  However I think that once you do that you will
see that your evidence is not as sturdy as you'd like  Most of the tired
arguements you stated assume eyewitness accounts such is not the case But
Anyway look at Mack and Crossan and then get back to us

 Suppose you were part of the Christian consipracy' which was going to  
 tell people that Christ had risen  Never mind the stoning the being  
 burned alive the possible crucifixion  let's just talk about a  
 scourging  The whip that would be used would have broken pottery metal  
 bone and anything else that they could find attached to it  You would be  
 stood facing a wall with nothing to protect you   
 scream out in agony that your raw back was being torn at again  You would  
 say to yourself All this for a lie'  And you had  more coming
 
 At the third hit you would scream out that it was all a lie beg for them  
 to stop and tell them that you would swear on your life that it had all  
 been a lie if they would only stop

No one was ever flogged beaten burned fed to the lions or killed in any
other way because of a belief in the resurrection  sorry to disappoint you
The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different
forms in the religions of antiquity  The problem was not the resurrection
which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population 
the Saducees but was a non issues for everyone else  The real problem was
that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god  When the
state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor   monotheism 
becomes a capital offense  The Jews were able to get exemption from this
and were also not evangelistic  Christians were far more vocal and gentile
and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution  Also since
Christians were a relatively powerless group they made good scapegoats as is
seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome  Let's not cloud the
issues with the resurrection

randy

I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically
because they believed in resurrection  However the beliefs that did
cause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus
Of course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other
than a great conspiracy  The most common theory among nonChristians
scholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event 
in effect a delusion  clh

 Not honoring our wives can cause our prayers to be hindered
 
         You husbands likewise live with your wives in
         an understanding way as with a weaker vessel
         since she is a woman  and grant her honor as
         a fellow heir of the grace of life so that your
         prayers may not be hindered  I Peter 

One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin 
of physically abusing one's wife  The husband is usually physically 
stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her  
He must honor her as his sister in Christ  This would therefore be an 
example of a specific sin that blocks prayer

This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what 
is God's will for his family without consulting his wife  God reveals 
His will to both the husband and the wife  There needs to be some 
degree of mutuality in decision making  Even those whose understanding 
of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the 
husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family  
One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband 
and to the husband through the wife

Eric Damien was presenting his views on Christianity I'll
respond to a few of his points

In article Aprathosrutgersedu gsuuxaecnbguedu Eric Molas writes
 Firstly I am an atheist I am not posting here as an immature flame
 start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience
 
 Strong opinions start here
 
  The human being is an animal who has due to hisher advanced
 mental facilities developed religion as a satisfiable solution to
 explain the unexplainable  For example the ancient Greeks believed
 that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real  Due
 to the advancement of our technology we know this to be false

This is certainly a valid objection to religionasexplanationof
nature  

Fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of
questions that can never be reduced away by natural science  For
example why does the universe exist at all  After all the timespace
world didn't have to exist  Why does anything exist And is it
possible for persons eg man to come into being out of a purely
impersonal cosmos  These questions which look at the real mysteries of
life  the creation of the world and of persons  provide a permanent
indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
found outside that world in its Source


 We are just animals  We need sleep food and we reproduce  And we
 die      
 
 Religion especially Christianity is nothing more than a DRUG
 Some people use drugs as an escape from reality  Christians inject
 themselves with jeezus and live with that high 

When you say that man is only an animal I have to think that you are
presenting an unprovable statement  a dogma if you will  And one
the requires a kind of faith too   By taking such a hard line in
your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own

But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow I hope
you'll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by
reading Paul Johnson's A History of Christianity  From your remarks
it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian
religion and not others  Even an atheist should have enough faith in
Man to know that a movement of  years has to have some depth and
be animated by some enduring values

With best wishes

Pardon me a humble atheist but exactly what is the difference
between holding a revealed truth with blind faith as its basis ie
regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary as an
absolute truth fully expecting people to believe you and arrogance

     They sound like one and the same to me

     I see no wisdom whatsoever in your words

I'm not surprised that you see no wisdom in them  That is because your
premises are wrong from the word Go  You claim that Christianity is
based on blind faith but this simply is not so  Just look at the
current thread on the evidence for Jesus' resurrection for evidence
that Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death

Furthermore you say that Christians hold to their beliefs regardless of
any evidence that you may find to the contrary  Without any evidence
to support your claim this statement is little more than an ad hominem 
argument

Mind you I don't mean this as a personal attack  I'm merely pointing out
the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion
It would make much more sense if you could prove that all Christians do 
base their belief on empty nothings and that they do ignore all evidence to 
the contrary  Only then can you expect your attack to make sense

In socreligionchristian you write

Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies  While I'm not real sure of
his credibility I do remember a book he wrote called A VISION or
something like that  He made a prediction that people who bought gold
would be hurt financially  At the time gold was up to about 
now it is less than half that  This prediction stuck in my mind
because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold

Note that the above type of prediction does not require a God to be made
An expert in a field can also predict things based on experience
Beware of predictions like The volcano will erupt tomorrow  Don't
follow the preacher because of such statements that come true

Note also that if I'm describing a hypothetical death of a friend as
a result of his passion for fast motorcycles I might say his mother
predicted he would die  Of course his father may have said he 'll
make good money because of his hobby and depending upon the final
outcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one that's
relevant  A reader down the road will get the impression that the
mother or father had predicted accurately the event when it was just
a casual statement

Finally on prophesies note that there are many prophesies that can be
fulfilled my people often to fool believers  If I say Beware the
terminal will unexpectedly be shut off and then after  secs I turn
it off or have someone come out from another room and do it there was
no prediction  A similar situation arises with the establishment of
the Jewish state  While pressing for it prominent Jews argued that it
was predicted that they'd have a state again and that the time has
come  I've read this somewhere but can't think of the source  if
you can please let me know  In this case the establishment of the
state does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used
in order to push for the establishment of the state

Deciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky

Dear Netters

A new religious newsgroup socreligionislamahmadiyya was pro
posed  on  Oct     The discussion about this new proposed
newsgroup went on in various related groups  The  proposal  was
supposed to enter a vote during the last week of November  Due
to a false Call For Votes by some opponent the voting had to be
canceled  I  quote  here  a  statement  from  the  moderator  of
newannouncenewgroups


The current Call For Votes CFV for an Ahmadiyya newsgroup
 is being canceled A new call for votes will be issued within
 a few weeks possibly with a new impartial vote  taker  Discus
 sion on the proposal is still open until the new vote is called
                                 by Lawrence Nov  


A lot of confusion arose among the netter as  to  whom  to  vote
Therefore  it was decided to give a cool down period so that all
confusions are over It has been over  months  of  that  instant
and now we are again attempting to create this newsgroup A fresh
RFD is hereby being issued Please take part in  the  discussion
under the same  title heading  and in  newsgroups  or at least
crosspost it to newsgroups

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYAISLAM



        The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam an international organi
sation was founder in  in Qadian India The founder of this
sect Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad  proclaimed to be the
Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major
religions of the world today Islam Christianity Judiasm  Hin
duism  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of
Jesus Christ metaphorically the Muslim Mahdi and the Promised
Messiah  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all
the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger
from God have been fulfilled

        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and
extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims Chris
tians Jews and Hindus of that age Such opposition is often wit
nessed  in  the history of divine reformers Even today this sect
is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes
Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution this sect has won many
adherents in  countries It has over  million followers who
come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background

        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about
a better understanding of religion and the founders of all reli
gions Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth
erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith Ahmadi
Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe
cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism

        Among its many philanthropic activities the sect has es
tablished  a network of hundreds of schools hospitals and clin
ics in many third world countries These institutions are staffed
by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's
internal resources

        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral
reform  establish  peace and justice and to unite mankind under
one universal religion

In a previous article dleonarandybgsuedu Pixie says

     Do the words Question Authority mean anything to you

     I defy any theist to reply      

Well despite what my mother told me about accepting dares here goes
 
You have to be very careful about what you mean by question authority
Taken literally it is nonsense That which is authoratative is authoratative
and to say I question to word of this authority is ridiculous If it is 
open to question it isn't an authority On the other hand it is perfectly
reasonable to question whether something is an authority The catch phrase
here should be authenticate authority Once you have authenticated
your authority you must believe what it says or you are not treating it as
an authority 

The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy You 
can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency
in what it teaches or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of
discourse But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not in
inself accredit it Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and 
other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false
I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings 
because if I can independantly verify its teachings I don't need an 
authority I need an authority only when there is information I need which
I cannot get for myself Thus if I am to authenticate an authority I must
do it by some means other than by examining its teachings 

In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't
have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves Every scientist
woring today assumes on the authority of the scintific community all sorts
of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to 
verify for himself

In spiritual matters we accept authority because we have no direct source 
ofinformation We select our authorities based on various criteria I am
a Catholic in part because the historical claims of the RC church seem
the strongest Without authorities there would be no subject matter for
belief unless we simply made something up for ourselves as many do

The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities This is a
reasonable assertion in itself but it leads to a practical difficulty
If you reject all authority out of hand you reject all possibility of
every receiving information Thus the atheist position can never possibly
change It is nonfalsifiable and therefore unscintific 

To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence is to deny
God's existence since neither science nor reason can in their very
nature prove anything

davembnrca Dave Mielke writes

  However God's love is qualified  The Bible says
 
      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD  but he
      loveth him that followeth after righteousness   Proverbs 
 
      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of
      the ungodly shall perish                            Psalm 
 
  
I am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it  God's love 
is unconditional unqualified unfathomable  We are capable of 
rejecting God's love but He never fails to love us

These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He 
is opposed to evil

I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be 
an innappropriate emphasis on Hell  God deserves our love and worship 
because of who He is  I do not like the idea of frightening people into 
accepting Christ  

I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with 
putting into words and explaining that love  Preaching the Gospel 
without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a 
clanging cymbal

Here's a question  How many of you are Christians because you are 
afraid of going to Hell  How many are responding to God's love

jemurraymagnusacsohiostateedu John E Murray writes

 I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my
 wife and me lately liturgy in particular Catholic liturgy  In the last fe
 years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass  It's
 driving me crazy  The most gracefilled aspect of a liturgical tradition is
 that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how 
 do it  Led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we 
 present to God  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers

On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the 
same  John has described some of these  On the other hand some people 
seem to start tuning out the same old words' and pay attention better 
when things get changed around  I think innovative priests and liturgy 
committees are trying to get our attention and make things more 
meaningful for us  It drives me crazy too 

Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy  My 
local parish is innovative  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish 
over  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the 
style which best suits us  John put a smiley on it but to just offer 
it up probably is the solution

A related issue that it sounds like John does not have to deal with is 
that spouses may have different liturgical tastes  My husband does like 
innovative litury  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual 
needs without just going our separate ways  When you include the factor 
of also trying to satisfy our children's needs things get pretty 
complicated

One thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial Mass is still 
Mass

because one fears death more than life  I feel so sorry for Eric and 
yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as 
further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity    

As a Christian I am free to be a human person  I think love choose

Christ is not a kind of drug  Drugs are a replacement for Christ  
Those who have an empty spot in the Godshaped hole in their hearts must 
do something to ease the pain  This is why the most effective

The story I related is one of the seven apparitions
approved by our Church as worthy of belief  It happened
in La Salle France

The moral lesson of the story is

The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has 
been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives
worthy of being done in Heaven  Mary weeps for The Lamb and
for the rest of her offsprings  This will continue while we 
disobey God or sin against Him  Mary as a messenger 
has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil
serpent communism wars famine unfaithful disobedience
to God etc running after the rest of her offsprings   
The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is 
brought back by her peace and loving messages reparations for sins 
to obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence 
of The Lamb

As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the
Son of God in her womb Mary has been preparing us the Church
the Body of Christ for His second coming making sure we are 
protected from the dragon  Also she has been preparing the new 
Eden by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve  The new Eden will be
the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His
next coming
    
I relate the story again
    I believe this and Mary in one of her apparitions  
    in th or th century she appeared to these      
    two children who tends goats and cows I forgot     
    the exact place  She was  weeping and telling the 
    children that she is afraid she's going to lose her
    Son's arm  She is mourning too for these          
    townfolks because it was their fault that there     
    would be drought in their harvest not much good    
    food again this year as it was last year           
                                                        
    Mary tells the children                            
    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    
    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  
    honoring God  These townfolks swears and           
    uses her Son's name in bad words  That is          
    why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain              
    Then she asked them if they pray  The children     
    said hardly  She asked them to pray every        
    morning and night  When the children went back     
    from work they had to tell somebody about this     
    When the news was spred and after thorough          
    investigation of the incident the townfolks        
    were converted and faith and obedience to God       
    were restored in their community

 This is certainly a valid objection to religionasexplanationof
 nature  

 Fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of
 questions that can never be reduced away by natural science  For
 example why does the universe exist at all  

Must there be a why to this  I ask because of what you also
     assume about God namely that He just exists with no why
     to His existence  So the question is reversed Why can't
     we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to
     just exist  Why must there be a why to the universe

 After all the timespace
 world didn't have to exist  Why does anything exist And is it
 possible for persons eg man to come into being out of a purely
 impersonal cosmos  These questions which look at the real mysteries of
 life  the creation of the world and of persons  provide a permanent
 indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
 found outside that world in its Source

It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also
     create man  Now I don't see this happening in my lifetime
     nor do I assert it is probable  But the possibility is there
     given scientists are working hard at decoding out genetic
     code to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation
     Again though must there be why or a divine prupose to
     man's existence

 When you say that man is only an animal I have to think that you are
 presenting an unprovable statement  a dogma if you will  And one
 the requires a kind of faith too   By taking such a hard line in
 your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own

As far as we can tell man falls into the mammal catagory  Now
     if there were something more to the man say a soul then
     we have yet to find evidence of such  But as it is now man
     is a mammal babies are born live mother gives milk we're
     warmblooded etc as other mammals are and is similar in
     genetic construction to some of them in particular primates
     For more on this check out talkorigins

 But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow I hope
 you'll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by
 reading Paul Johnson's A History of Christianity  From your remarks
 it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian
 religion and not others  Even an atheist should have enough faith in
 Man to know that a movement of  years has to have some depth and
 be animated by some enduring values

Well then Buddhism Confucianism Taoism Hinduism Judaism
     Zoerasterism Shintoism and Islam should fit this bit of logic
     quite nicely   All have depth all have enduring values
     thus all must be true

 	But recently I read Peter Brown's Body and Society It is very
 well researched and well written But is raises some very upsetting
 questions The early Christians were weird  even more so than today's
 carzy fundies They had odd views on sex odder views on the body 
 totally ludicrous views about demons and distinctly uncharitable
 views about other human beings 

If possible last I heard it was out of print but they were considering 
reprinting read Barbara Hambly's Search the Seven Hills  It is 
historical fiction set in Rome at the time of the early Church  She 
captures the weirdness of the early Christians and yet gives glimpses of 
the holiness too  Some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the 
context of the society they lived in  I found it a remarkably positive 
view of Christianity considering that the author is not a Christian 
herself  Another plus is that each chapter begins with an 
originalsource quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious 
research

If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus I think
you will find that arrogance has to do with an offensive exhibition of
presumed or real superiority a paraphrase from my own Webster's
Arrognace is about pride and haughtiness A person can believe in absolute
truth even blindly whatever that means without being obnoxious about it
Just as a person can be a humble authorityquestioning
defyinganytheisttoreply athiest and be quite arrogant Arrogance is not
about what you believe it is about how you relate to what you believe and
how you present it to others If your overwhelming experience of Christians
has been that they are arrogant I apologozing both for myself and on the

forums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people is that arrogant
Christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers

 Nobody ever displayed the dead body of Jesus even though both the
Jewish and the Roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so
it would have discredited the Christians

It is told in the Gospels that the Pharisees sp and scribes bribed

belief that their faith is total truth  According to them
their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of
God and God is truth  thus they know the truth  This stance
makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own
hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way
Their way is the 'truth'

But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe
a particular way  That choice is part faith and part reason
but it seems to me a choice

My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard
discussions when I was in grade school

A kid would say All policemen are jerks  I'd ask How do
you know  Because my daddy told me so  How do you know
you're daddy is right  He says he's always right

Well the argument usually stops right there  In the end
aren't we all just kids groping for the truth  If so do we have
the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as
false

I find this argument very strange though not unfamiliar

An analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it

Say for example there are people living on a volcanic island and a group 
of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent They warn the people on 
the island that they are in danger and should leave A group of people on 
the island is given the task of warning others of the danger

They believe the danger is real but others may not 

Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning 
others of the danger Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs 
are correct and all others are false

Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance and behave in an 
arrogant manner but that is a personal idiocyncracy It does not 
necessarily mean that they are all arrogant

In article Aprathosrutgersedu jemurraymagnusacsohiostateedu John E Murray writes
Example  Last Sunday Palm Sunday we went to the local church  Usually
on Palm Sunday the congregation participates in reading the Passion taking
the role of the mob  The theology behind this seems profoundwhen we say
Crucify him we mean it  We did it and if He came back today we'd do it
again  It always gives me chills  But last week we were invited to sit
during the Gospel Passion and listen  Besides the Orwellian invitation 

   On Palm Sunday at our parish we were invited to take the role of
Jesus in the Passion  I declined to participate  Last year at the
liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins so
therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd but
to no avail

musicians readers and so on  New things are introduced in the course of the
liturgy and since no one knows what's happening the new things have to be
explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the Mass we're just
sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the Mass is about
to be done  In my mind I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay
experts but that may not be just  I do think that a liturgy committee has a
bias toward doing something rather than nothingthat's just a fact of
bureaucratic lifeeven though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for
people to be aware of the Lord's presence

   As a member of a liturgy committee I can tell you that the problem
is certain people dominating who want to try out all kinds of
innovations  The priests don't seem even to want to make any
decisions of their own in many cases  I guess it's easier to try
something new than it is to refuse to allow it

   At our parish on Holy Thursday instead of the priests washing feet
Who wants to get around people's feet according to one of our
priests the congregation was invited to come up and help wash one
another's hands

   The symbolism of this action distressed me and again I refused to
participate  I thought that if we were to have to come up with
rubrics for this liturgical action ie Body of Christ  Amen
for receiving Communion that they could be I am not responsible for
the blood of this man

   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer Blessed are You God of
all creation was substituted some text read by a lay couple  The
priest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to
others and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion
that night we aren't required to anyway  I instead offered up
prayers for our priests and parish

So we've been wonderingare we the oddballs or is the quality of the Mass
going down  I don't mean that facetiously  We go to Mass every Thursday or
Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware 
of God's presence  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Massesmaybe I should 
just offer it up   Has anyone else noticed declining congregational
participation in Catholic Masses lately

   The quality of the Mass has not changed  Again if it were to be
celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church it would
still be liturgically beautiful  The problem comes about from
people trying to be creative who are not

   I think the answer to your question on participation could be that
given by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by
the title of Thomas Day's Why Catholics Can't Sing  They don't
want to because of all this nonsense

   By the way for any nonCatholics reading this the problem does
not reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church but by those who are
disobedient to the Church in changing it on their own authority

Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell president of
Moody Bible Institute

  The other day I was at the dry cleaner and the radio was playing
  It caught my attention because a talk show guest was criticizing
  evangelical Christians saying we believe in absolutes and think we
  are the only ones who know what the absolutes are

  We affirm the absolutes of Scripture not because we are arrogant
  moralists but because we believe in God who is truth who has revealed
  His truth in His Word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic
  importance of those absolutes

There has been a lot of discussion but so far nobody seems to have hit on
exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at

The arrogance being attacked is that we think we are the only ones who know
what the absolutes are  In short many evangelicals claim that they are
infallible on the matter of religious texts

In particular the problem is one of epistemology  As a shorthand you can
think of epistemology as how do you know  That question it turns out is
a very troubling one

The problem with absolute certainty' is that at the bottom at least some of
the thinking goes on inside your own head  Unless you can be certain that
everything which happens in your head is infallible the reasoning you did to
discover a source of truth is in question

And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of
authority  which means you do NOT have absolute certainty


Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy and a fictional
Inerrantist named Zeke  The following arguments applies to the idea of
Papal Infallibility too

Zeke has we presume spent some time studying the Bible and history and
several other topics  He has concluded based on all these studies and
possibly some religious experiences that the Bible is a source of Absolute
Truth

He may be correct but even if he is he cannot be certain that he is correct
His conclusion depends on how well he studied history  he may have made
mistakes and the references he used may have contained mistakes  His
conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible  he may have made
mistakes  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning  and he may have made
mistakes  Noticing a common thread yet  

Everything about his study of the world that he did  everything that
happened in his own head  is limited by his own thinking  No matter what
he does to try and cover his mistakes he can never be certain of his own
infallibility  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own
reasoning that belief cannot be considered absolutely certain

Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth  but that belief
is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it  Unless he can
say that his own reasoning is flawless his conclusions are in doubt

Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on
your own thinking  there is no way out of the loop  Only an infallible
thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs


This is easy to demonstrate  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing
epistemology how do you know  Imagine a hypothetical discussion

 A The Bible is a source of absolute truth

 B How do you know

 A I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church
    teachings and came to this conclusion

 B How do you know you studied history correctly

 A Well I doublechecked everything

 B How do you know you doublechecked correctly

 A Well I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed

 B Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is
    true  How do you know THEY studied it correctly

 A 

And as you see B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say I
can't prove that there are no mistakes  and as long as you may have made a
mistake then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain

There is no way out of the loop


This is where the arrogance of Christians arises many people believe
that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the
doctrines of Christianity  they are implicitly claiming that they are
infallible and that there is no possibility of mistake

Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake and that your thinking has led
you to a flawless conclusion is pretty arrogant

 

People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to
find The Infallibility of the Church by George Salmon  He is attacking
the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible and he does so very well
but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is
knowably Inerrant

 Are all truths also absolutes
 Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes
 
 If the answer to either of these questions is no then perhaps you can 
 explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths and
 which truths are absolutes  
 
 The answer to both questions is yes

Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then  To me
an absolute is something that is constant across time culture
situations etc  True in every instance possible  Do you agree
with this definition  I think you do

 Similarly all truth is absolute  Indeed a nonabsolute truth is a 
 contradiction in terms  When is something absolute  When it is always
 true  Obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a
 contradiction in terms  

A simple example

In the New Testament sorry I don't have a Bible at work and can't
provide a reference women are instructed to be silent and cover
their heads in church  Now this is scripture  By your definition 
this is truth and therefore absolute  

Do women in your church speak  Do they cover their heads  If all 
scripture is absolute truth it seems to me that women speaking in and 
coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals  
Yet clearly women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare 
heads  At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew 
up in

Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth  And there are plenty of other examples
Can you reconcile this

 Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world  Such a
 statement is terribly selfcontradictory  Let me put it to you this
 way  If there are no absolutes shouldn't we conclude that the statement
 There are no absolutes is not absolutely true  Obviously we have a
 contradiction here

I don't claim that there are no absolutes  I think there are very
few though and determining absolutes is difficult

 This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming
 that there are indeed absolutes in the universe

 There is hardly consensus even in evangelical 
 Christianity not to mention the rest of Christianity regarding 
 Biblical interpretation
 
 So  People sometimes disagree about what is true This does not negate 
 the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe  

But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute  How can you
determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how
to interpret the Scripture  

It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based 
on your own interpretation is absolute  Do you deny that your own
background education prejudices etc come into play when you read the 
Bible and determine how to interpret a passsage  Do you deny that 
you in fact interpret

According to what I have read on Biblical idioms speaking in X's
name is a standard AramaicHebrew legal idiom for what we today
would call Power of Attorney  A person from Jesus' culture authorized
to conduct business in John's name had full authority over John's
financial affairs but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to
work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes  It was
not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with
in John's name it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney
and be operating in good faith Note the overlap here between legal
and religious definitions of faith

With this cultural background praying in Jesus' name does not
mandate a particular verbal formula rather it requires that the
petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous
fiduciary relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His
Kingdom  The message of praying in Jesus' name is thus closely
aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's
delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards both resources and
responsibilities  This idea of praying in Jesus' name is not only
present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer although the verbal
forumula is absent

The act of praying the words In Jesus' Name may be beneficial if
they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the
advancement of God's Kingdom  For that reason I'm not quite ready
to say that the praying the formula is without meaning

Prayers to God for other purposes desperation anger thanksgiving
etc don't seem to be in this category at all whether uttered by
Christian or nonChristian whether BC or AD that's BCE or
CE for you PC   I don't see anything in Christ's words to
contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His
omniscience and grace

	One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is
their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity Being
brought up in a Christian household I often wondered if there was God
the Father where was the mother Everyone I know who has a father
usually as a mother It just seemed rather unbalanced to me 
	Fortunately my own personal theology which will probably not
fall into line with a lot others recognized God as a being both
without gender and posessing qualities of both genders as being both
a masculine and feminine force It provides a sense of balance I find
sorely lacking in most theologies a lack which I think is responsible
for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat
each other

gsuuxaecnbguedu Eric Molas writes

Firstly I am an atheist I am not posting here as an immature flame
start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience



 The human being is an animal who has due to hisher advanced
mental facilities developed religious as a satisfiable solution to
explain the unexplainable 

	Hmmm  There are other animals on this planet with advanced
	mental facilities which have not developed religion as a
	satisfactory explaination for the unexplained  Why is this so

	Further it appears that only humans have a need to explain the
	unexplained  Why is this so  The other animals on this planet
	including those with advanced mental facilities seem perfectly
	content in their ignorance

	I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me
	from your unsupported statement  They are  humans are animal
	only  religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need
	not be researched  religion was made up by humans to address a
	perceived need  the biological aspect of humans is deified that
	is all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical
	structure with biology at the apex

	Needless to say I disagree with your strong opinion  and the
	underlying presuppositions

Christianity is an infectious cult  The reasons it flourishes are 
because  it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life
a safety blanked to hide behind  Oh wowall i have to do is 
follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness
For all of you found jeezus  how many of you were on the brink

	I disagree that Christianity is an infectious cult  It has
	certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system in
	spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia
	That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is
	infectious in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provides
	a workable system for its adherents and I would argue that this
	is the case

	I disagree that Christianity is a safety blanket which supplants
	hope and purpose  Rather it points an individual to the one
	Source of hope and purpose  There is nothing hidden about a
	Christian's source for hope and purpose  Of what usefulness to
	you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose
	and externally given hope and purpose  Is the apparent loss of
	control over one's own life the problem or is it something else

	Finally one does not appropriate eternal happiness by following
	Christian moral standards  Indeed the sole reason for the existance
	of Christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people
	from their imperfections  Moral standards are merely guides to the
	Christian the real power to moral living is given to the Christian
	in the Person of God's Spirit

	Heaven is one of two final states that
	Christian doctrine postulates  However Christians are generally
	not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this
	promised future reward rather they are motivated by the perceived
	benefits to them in the hereandnow

but i digress   The other reason christianity flourishes is its
infectious nature  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian
group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which
basicaly said this Priority  Spread the Word

	Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a
	priority and rightly so for it was Jesus Himself who gave this
	as a priority for His followers  However it is not the penultimate
	priority as evangelism is normally understood ie preach the word
	convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum
	Rather such evangelism is generally best done through respecting
	the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits
	of a Christian lifestyle  This demonstration should be so powerful
	that it compels the nonChristian to seek out the Christian to ask
	Why  Needless to say such a demonstration is not easily accom
	plished it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus it
	does not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the Christian
	is required and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of
	friendship exist it is ineffective with strangers who cannot
	evaluate the demonstration over time and it is easy to alienate or
	harm others if the sole purpose of being a friend is to gain a
	conversion

	As a longtime Christian nearly  years I view with some skep
	ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate a hurryup
	attitude  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no
	conversion at all because the pressured convert realizes she was
	coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open
	to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now
	The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings
	conviction of wrongdoing to people  I am content to do my part
	witness and let the Spirit do the rest

We are just animals  We need sleep food and we reproduce  And we
die      

	We are far more than animals  We sleep eat reproduce and die
	just as other animals do  true  But we are also capable of more
	than this  If your personal vision of humanity or of yourself is
	so limited I can only hope and pray  that you will someday find
	a more expansive view

	For reflection what animals have the wide variety of performing
	arts that humans do  How is it that humans can learn the language
	of other humans or animals but that other animals cannot do so
	How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social
	structures whereas other animals have only one structure

Religion especially Christianity is nothing more than a DRUG

	Blatant assertion  Christianity is not physically addictive
	Christianity is not psychologically addictive  Christianity is not
	a thing which one snortsingestsshootsup it is a relationship
	with a living being  You might as validly characterize any close
	knit relationship with this appelation

Some people use drugs as an escape from reality  Christians inject
themselves with jeezus and live with that high 

	There are Jesus freaks who let the emotional aspects of worship
	and Christian living gain and retain the upper hand  Even so
	this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these
	things flow

It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious
wars of which Christianity has had no small part

	Guilty by association  That christianity which forces itself
	upon another is not Christianity at all

When Christians see a nonbeliever they say that person is blind
to the truth but they cannot realize that it is they who live
with this mask of fakeness each day  Jesus was just prophet  
who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans
were circa ad dispersing the Jewish population and communities
needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time
of dire need

	You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened
	 years ago  How did you come by it

	I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole
	result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in AD  He was  years
	gone by this time  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert
	that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy until the sack

I must go  These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity

	Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself
	What do you know of Him

The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting Does He grade on
a curve does He cheat That is interesting Not to mention thought
provoking My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His
children In that He loves us with a love that we can never understand
until we are with Him The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the
final measure From that perspective in a grading context the heart is
the final test
Specifically most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven
and one Hell From that perspective it is Heaven or Hell You either go
to one or the other The grading on a passfail basis is done by God
the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son Not by others For only
God sees the heart The Bible says of the heart who can know it I

That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure In an uncertain
and ever changing landscape He is always the same Yesterday today and

of the test my own conviction is no Were that the case I certainly

the best for His own There maybe decipline but there is more love
It's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test to see who makes it
and who doesn't Those who do passHeaven and those who don't go to the
other place But it is really much more than that
There are few experts Most of us are just travelers looking for the
light and the way Home Praying that we can bring others with us

  I'm inclined to read descriptions such as the lake of fire as

  It's my personal view but the only denominations I know of that hold 
  it officially are the JW's and SDA's
 
 I can't find the reference right now but didn't CSLewis speculate 
 somewhere that hell might be the state of once having been a human 
 soul
Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure
from punishing people  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and
his angels

To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with
the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed remember the Bible
teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement  Their
judgement is soon to come

Let me suggest this  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory
should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it  Stay away
from human theories and only take into account references in the bible

   I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of

 understanding of God  I could be wrongare there any former atheists here
 who were led to Christianity by argument

This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are
any such cases  I doubt it  In the medieval period esp thcent
when Aquinas flourished argument was a useful tool because everyone
knew the rules  Today when you can't count on people knowing even
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric a good argument is
often indistinguishable from a poor one

   seannabnrca Seanna SM Watson asks
  What is the objection to celebration of Easter
 
       The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it 
Easter or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings is the pagan
whore goddess of fertility  Therefore your question to me is what is
the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess  When phrased
that way I suspect or at least I would HOPE that it becomes immeadiately
apparent what my objection to celebrating her would be
 
  It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus
 
      No you are thinking perhaps of Ressurection Sunday I think 
Though I'm not too crazy about the word Sunday but I certainly like
this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess
     For that matter stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet The Feast of
First Fruits  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following
the Sabbath of Passover week  Sunday by any other name in modern
parlance  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection
on the st day of the week on which it actually occured  Why jump it all
over the calendar the way Easter does  Why not just go with the Sunday
following Passover the way the Bible has it  Why seek after unbiblical
methods
 
  I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate
  the resurrection but it is the sole and only reason that
  we are Christianshow could we not celebrate it
 
      So what does this question have to do with Easter the whore
goddess  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection  Just keep that
whore out of the discussion
 
  If it is only the name which is a problem I suggest that if
  we are too concerned about etymology there are a lot of
  words we are going to have to drop  As an aside some
  terminally PC people here in Ottawa want dictionaries to be
  altered so that there are no negative definitions associated
  with the word black so as not to offend people of colour
 
       Yes I have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave
streets with AfroCanadiantop  grin I still think blacktop sounds
better though
 
  As a short person I hope they will also remove the definition
  curt or surly associated with my physical description
 
       Fine by me  And while we are at it the lefthanded people are
both sinister and gauche so we probably will have some objections from
that quarter as well
 
  In Quebec French the word for the celebration of the
  resurrection is Paquesthis is etymologically related
  to Pesach Passover and the pascal lamb  So is the
  French Canadian mostly Roman Catholic celebration better
  because it uses the right name
 
      Yes that sounds much better to me  Is there anyone out there would
thinks that phrasing sounds worse
 
  So from this I infer that there are different rules for
  Christians of Jewish descent  What happened to there is
  neither Jew nor Greek slave nor free male nor female for
  all are one in Christ Jesus
 
      Read the letter to Philemon  Now tell me was Philemon's slave
returned to him  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon
Philemon  How about male and female  Are there different rules that
apply to them as well  Or if there is no more male and female can Adam
and Steve get married to each other in your congregation  Yes there are
differences in form and function  But the way we come to Salvation in
Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life
 


I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion as it
seems repetitive but this particular point is one that I believe is
new  the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name

I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this
argument  Words often change their meaning over time  The days of
the week are of course originally based on pagan gods  Some
Christians prefer to refer to first day second day etc  However
the majority of Christians have not been persuaded  The question
seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows
as the derivation of a word if what people mean by it and think when
they use it is different

Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be
dangerous  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the
celebration of Christ's resurrection  Postings trying to convince
them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run
the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose
They are doing their best to create a linkage in people's minds
between their celebration and the pagan goddess  It's not clear that
this is a healthy thing

Several recent posts have identified the English word 'Easter' with
the Babylonian goddess 'Ishtar'

'Easter' is a pagan word all right but it has nothing to do with Ishtar
If 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related their history would show it
But in Old English Easter was 'Eostre' cognate with English 'East'
and German 'Ost'   The reconstructed ProtoGermanic form is 'Austron'
Not until after  did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'
Clearly the two words have quite separate origins

There may be neopagans who worship Ishtar at Easter but if so they
are making either a mistake of etymology or a deliberate play on words

In fact that is the reason Easter jumps all over the calendar Passsover
itself is a lunar holiday not a solar one and thus falls over a wide
possible span of times  The few times that Easter does not fall during or
after Passover are because Easter is further linked to the Vernal Equinox
the beginning of spring

       So what does this question have to do with Easter the whore
 goddess  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection  Just keep that

Your obsession with the term whore clouds your argument  Whore is
a value judgement not a descriptive term

more deletions

Overall this argument is an illustration of the etymological fallacy
see JP Louw Semantics of NT Greek  That is the idea that the true
meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form  In fact our
own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with
how it is used not where it came from  Very few modern people would
make any connection whatsoever between Easter and Ishtar  If Daniel
Seagard does then for him it has that meaning  But that is a highly
idiosyncratic meaning and not one that needs much refutation

publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to God and
are unswervingly committed to one another I realize this is a subjective

I have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of 
Christ's resurrection  

First the scriptural quotations

This sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified
if not then your beleif is in vain so you might as well beleive  Most
of these quotations are of people who do beleive  People who would
try to justify their own positions

Second the logical proof

much deleted

              In nearly  centuries no body has ever been
                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He
                would indeed rise from the dead

              The probability of being able to perpetrate such
                a hoax successfully upon the entire world for
                nearly  centuries is astronomically negative
                                       
end quoted text

 The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger
does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered  In fact
the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes

Finally

There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ except in our spirits
communion with his and the Father's  It is a matter of FAITH belief
without logical proof  Incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for
rational western man myself included

I hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a 
rejection of the resurrection's occurance  I beleive but I wanted to point 
out the weakness of logical proofs

 Are all truths also absolutes
 Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes
 
 If the answer to either of these questions is no then perhaps you can 
 explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths and
 which truths are absolutes  
 
 The answer to both questions is yes

Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then  To me
an absolute is something that is constant across time culture
situations etc  True in every instance possible  Do you agree
with this definition  I think you do

 Similarly all truth is absolute  Indeed a nonabsolute truth is a 
 contradiction in terms  When is something absolute  When it is always
 true  Obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a
 contradiction in terms  

Yes I do agree with your definition  My use of the term always is
rather deceptive I admit  
 
A simple example

In the New Testament sorry I don't have a Bible at work and can't
provide a reference women are instructed to be silent and cover
their heads in church  Now this is scripture  By your definition 
this is truth and therefore absolute  

Hold it  I said that all of scripture is true  However discerning
exactly what Jesus Paul and company were trying to say is not always so
easy  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should
behave that way  Rather he was trying to say that under the circumstances
at the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and
cover their heads  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward
others  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived
from absolutes  For instance it is absolutely right for Christians to
strive for peace  However this does not rule out trying to maintain world
peace by resorting to violence on occasion  Yes my opinion
 
Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth  And there are plenty of other examples
Can you reconcile this

Sure  The Bible preaches absolute truths  However exactly what those
truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion  As I said the Bible does
preach absolute truths  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal
clear at least to evangelicals  Sometimes they are not so clear to
everyone eg should baptism be by full immersion or not etc  That is
largely because sometimes it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers
are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole  This is 
where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in  
 
It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based 
on your own interpretation is absolute  

God revealed his Truths to the world through His Word  It is utterly 
unavoidable however that some people whill come up with alternate 
interpretations  Practically anything can be misinterpreted especially
when it comes to matters of right and wrong  Care to deny that

because one fears death more than life

This would truely be a miserably existance which I doubt Eric
endures Life can be enjoyable so you can live it because you like
it or purposefull so you can live it to get something done One should
endeavour to make it so if it is not Otherwise it would be as you say
Terrible

  I feel so sorry for Eric and 
yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as 
further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity    

Probably true Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as
an illusion and does not want it So maybe it isn't so bad

As a Christian I am free to be a human person  I think love choose 
and create

As an atheist I am free to be a human person I think love choose
and create

 I will live forever with God

Ah now here we begin to diverge I will not live forever
with anyone

I don't think you will either but you are welcome to your
opinion on the matter

Christ is not a kind of drug

I tend to agree with you

It's my opinion that unlike drugs religions are normal
parts of human societies

I think they have outlived their usefullness but they
are evidently quite ordinary normal things that haven't
proved lethal to humanity yet

 Drugs are a replacement for Christ
Those who have an empty spot in the Godshaped hole in their hearts must 
do something to ease the pain

I have heard this claim quite a few times Does anybody here know
who first came up with the Godshaped hole business

  This is why the most effective 
substanceabuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples' spiritual 
needs

You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim
like this

Thank you Eric for your post  It has helped me to appreciate how much 
God has blessed me  I hope that you will someday have a more joyfilled 
and abundant life

I don't know Eric but I do not think it is wise to assume he has a less
joyfilled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs

In response to a lot of email I've gotten I need to clarify my position

I am not in favor of paganism

I am not in favor of the Easter Bunny or other nonChristian aspects of
Easter as presently celebrated  Incidentally Easter eggs are not
nonChristian they are a way of ending the Lenten fast

My point was to distinguish between
   intentionally worshipping a pagan deity and
   doing something which may once have had pagan associations but
nowadays is not understood or intended as such

Many people who are doing  are being accused of 

It would be illogical to claim that one is really worshipping a
pagan deity without knowing it  Worship is a matter of intention
One cannot worship without knowing that one is doing so

  Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically
removing the physical proofs of God's existence  As time goes on we have to
rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase
science is removing our props  I don't think this is a bad thing

	First of all I resent your assumption that you know why I
am threatened by science or even that I am threatened at all
although I admit the latter  The reason I am threatened by Science
has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence
God reveals Himself in many ways including to some degree
Science

	My problem with Science is that often it allows us to
assume we know what is best for ourselves  God endowed us
with the ability to produce life through sexual relations
for example but He did not make that availible to everyone
Does that mean that if Science can override God's decision
through alterations that God wills for us to have the power
to decide who should and should not be able to have 
children  Should men be allowed to have babies if that
is made possible

	People have always had the ability to end lives
unnaturally and soon may have the ability to bring lives
into the world unnaturally  The closest thing to artificially
created life is artificially created death and as God
has reserved judgement about when people should die to
Himself I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how
people should be brought in to the world

	This is not to say that I reject all forms of
medical treatment however  Treatment that alleviates
pain or prevents pain from occuring is perfectly
acceptable I believe as it was acceptable for Jesus
to cure the sick  However treatment that merely 
prolongs life for no reason or makes unnecessary 
alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes  
go too far  Are we not happy with the beauty God
gave us

	I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I
would approve of Scientific study and where I would not
but I will say this  Before one experiments with the
universe to find out all its secrets one should ask
why they want this knowledge  Before one alters the body
they have been given they should ask themseles why their
body is not satisfactory too them as it is  I cannot
make any general rules that will cover all the cases but
I will say that each person should pray for guidance
when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe and
should cease their unravelling if they have reason to 
believe their search is displeasing to God

Any former atheists converted by argument
This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are

knew the rules  Today when you can't count on people knowing even
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric a good argument is
often indistinguishable from a poor one

The last sentence is ironic since so many readers of
socreligionchristian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as
Josh McDowell and CS Lewis The above also expresses a rather odd sense
of history What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day who were
mostly illiterate knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people
today If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the

In article Aprathosrutgersedu caralvcaralvautotrolcom Carol Alvin writes
  
 
 Are all truths also absolutes
 Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes
 
 The answer to both questions is yes

Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then  To me
an absolute is something that is constant across time culture
situations etc  True in every instance possible  Do you agree
with this definition  I think you do

 Similarly all truth is absolute  Indeed a nonabsolute truth is a 
 contradiction in terms  When is something absolute  When it is always
 true  Obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a
 contradiction in terms  

I agree with Carol here  Determining absolutes is practically speaking a
waste of time  And we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative

For example I recently was asking some children the question What temperature
does water boil at  I got the answer  degrees consistently  I asked
if they knew what scale and was told It's just  degrees  Any scale
That's what all thermometers say  Well that's sincere and may be
true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong  IT is NOT
an absolute truth  Similarly Scripture is full of Truth which we should
nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth
and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time
and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point  Then religion
easily becomes an intellectual headtrip devoid of the living experience of 
the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism IMO
 
example of headcovering in Church deleted

This was a good example  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the
writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the
instructions apply to the Corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere
The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first
century culture and the particular climate at Corinth which was having
a LOT of trouble with order Is it Absolute Truth to me  No  And I 
see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be
 
Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth  And there are plenty of other examples
Can you reconcile this

Even the most diehard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally
I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your
babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally  The Bible
was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us
what parts should be interpreted which way 
 
 Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world  Such a
 statement is terribly selfcontradictory  Let me put it to you this
 way  If there are no absolutes shouldn't we conclude that the statement
 There are no absolutes is not absolutely true  Obviously we have a
 contradiction here

I don't claim that there are no absolutes  I think there are very
few though and determining absolutes is difficult

I agree  Very few  And even if we knew them personally we may not be 
able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another
The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference since I
know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me

 There is hardly consensus even in evangelical 
 Christianity not to mention the rest of Christianity regarding 
 Biblical interpretation
 
 So  People sometimes disagree about what is true This does not negate 
 the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe  

I can't prove the existence of absolutes  I can only rely upon MY experience
I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite
Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes  So I don't need them  
I can never know the essence of God only the energies by and through which
God is manifested to God's creation  So the reality can be that there ARE
absolutes but it is of no practical importance  It's like claiming that the
original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be  Swell
Who cares  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way  I might as 
well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they
live on Mars  Maybe God did  So what Is that going to have ANY effect on 
how I deal with my neighbor or God  Whether or not I go to this or that
cafeteria for lunch  No  

This attitude leads many nonChristians to believe that ALL Christians
are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning  Christianity is true
wonderful and sensible  It appeals to Reason since Reason is an inner
reflection of the Logos of God  Explanations that violate that simply
appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world

NOTE  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority That'd be silly
       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian
       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others
       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that
       and is generally agressive  Good parents like God are authoritative
       Many Christians are simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few 
       adults respond to this treatment

 The discussion begins why does the universe exist at all  

 
 Must there be a why to this  I ask because of what you also
      assume about God namely that He just exists with no why
      to His existence  So the question is reversed Why can't
      we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to
      just exist  Why must there be a why to the universe

One of the Laws of Nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate 
at least to this layman's mind there must be a causal event  No
reasonable alternative exists

As far as I can tell the very laws of nature demand a why  That isn't
true of something outside of nature ie supernatural

  

 
 It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also
      create man  Now I don't see this happening in my lifetime
      nor do I assert it is probable  But the possibility is there
      given scientists are working hard at decoding out genetic
      code to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation
      Again though must there be why or a divine prupose to
      man's existence

I believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes
but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining 
reproducing life ever  I've never been much of a prophet though I
can't even picture New York in my mind    I don't believe any
technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite
having all of the parts available Just my opinion

 
  When you say that man is only an animal I have to think that you are
  presenting an unprovable statement  a dogma if you will  And one
  the requires a kind of faith too   By taking such a hard line in
  your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own
 
 As far as we can tell man falls into the mammal catagory  Now
  
That preposition sort of precludes an absolute doesn't it  Without an 
absolute conclusion what are we left with  I believe the word faith
works nicely

      if there were something more to the man say a soul then
      we have yet to find evidence of such  But as it is now man
      is a mammal babies are born live mother gives milk we're
      warmblooded etc as other mammals are and is similar in
      genetic construction to some of them in particular primates
      For more on this check out talkorigins
 
  But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow I hope
  you'll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by
  reading Paul Johnson's A History of Christianity  From your remarks
  it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian
  religion and not others  Even an atheist should have enough faith in
  Man to know that a movement of  years has to have some depth and
  be animated by some enduring values
 
 Well then Buddhism Confucianism Taoism Hinduism Judaism
      Zoerasterism Shintoism and Islam should fit this bit of logic
      quite nicely   All have depth all have enduring values
      thus all must be true

Well then with an equal scale and under an equal standard investigate
them all and discover where God is  or whether he is for the denial of
God is ultimately a statement of faith nonfalsifiable as His existence 
may be 

For isn't this the purpose of religion  to discover and in discovery to
know God

You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your
research do you  After all if we of Christ are deluding ourselves you
really have nothing to worry about eh

Until the King returns

Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning
others of the danger Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs
are correct and all others are false

Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance and behave in an
arrogant manner but that is a personal idiocyncracy It does not
necessarily mean that they are all arrogant

No the members of the first group are not necessarily
arrogant  But when I ask them if they are absolutely certain
that the volcano will erupt I expect them to say so No
but I've chosen to believe some knowledgable people who have

so I wont be posting it on the news group

I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net
My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism
or legitimately excommunicated  But that's really beside the point
What does the Roman Catholic church say  Excommunication can be
real apart from formal excommunication as provided for in canon law

After all we Orthodox don't cinsider ourselves schismatic or

I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect though it was quite a few
years back and I can't cite the specifics  I also recall that Cecil Andrus who
was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration responded
to Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave
to man as recorded in Genesis  Which makes me wonder who are the
true conservatives  It seems to me that a conservative should want to
conserve things of value for longterm societal benefit  This form of
conservation should logically extend to the physical environment in 
which people live as well as the moral environment in which they relate
to one another and to God

IMHO Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served 
on the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization during a time in 
which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker 
in federal prison

therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd but
to no avail

musicians readers and so on  New things are introduced in the course of the
liturgy and since no one knows what's happening the new things have to be
explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the Mass we're just
sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the Mass is about
to be done  In my mind I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay
people to be aware of the Lord's presence

As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran  it is some of the
innovations of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return
to the more traditional Catholic Chuch  the Lutherans

I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in
the Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful  Our Lutheran parish just
instituted the Tenebrae service for Good Friday and I was the lector for 
a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional  I heard and learned things
that I have previously overlooked in the Gospels  yet those facts were
always there  As a matter of interest the pastor and I were talking about
the differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over
breakfast Easter Sunday

   As a member of a liturgy committee I can tell you that the problem
is certain people dominating who want to try out all kinds of
innovations  The priests don't seem even to want to make any
decisions of their own in many cases  I guess it's easier to try
something new than it is to refuse to allow it

My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family called music
and worship at our church  Our pastor does have control of this committee
but listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions  It needs a strong
hand to lead and guide to keep the intent and the message clear and strong
as it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year  Additional
reason for my leaving the Catholic faith  lack of any selfless spiritual
guidance by priests in my parishes  AKA wishywashy
 
As you may gather from my comments I feel that it is very important ir
regardless of denominational guidelines to have a serviceMass which promotes
the true reason that we are gathered there  I am quite comfortable in a
traditional Mass with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue the Sacrament
of PENANCE not Reconciliation Stations of the Cross so on and so forth
The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings
are not shared by everyone

I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord but I don't want 
them attending a show  It's not  My church works hard to have a meaningful
service during Lent on Wednesdays but follow traditional Lutheran Book of
Worship guidelines  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent such
as the Hymn of Praise it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it
is Not there

Quite frankly it is very hard for a nonCatholic to go to a Mass and fit in
My dear wife never could former Methodist  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils
would intimidate the daylights out of a nonCatholic  Those Catholics who
have beared with me this far understand what I mean

Please keep in mind why we are there  to gather together in worship  Not
to worry about how something is done or not done  If there is something
wrong that you feel needs addressing by all means talk to your priest or
pastor  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen  They are there to 
provide spiritual guidance and to help  Use them  My differences with
the Catholic Church are much more fundamental  but my decision to change
faiths was done with prayer intervention and sessions with priests and
ministers

In Christ

First I would like to thank all who sent me their opinions on the matter
at hand  All advice was taken to heart if not directly used  My friend
found out about the matter quite accidently  After reading some of my
mail I quit from the mail reader  went about my business  I must have
trashed my mail improperly because he got on the same terminal the next
day  saw my old messages  He thought they were responses to a post he
placed in altatheism earlier that week so he read some of them before
realizing that they were for me  I got a message from him the next day he
apologized for reading my mail  said that he did not want to appear to be
a snoop  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views 
didn't mind doing so especially with a friend  So we did  I neither
changed his mind nor did he change mine as that was not the point  Now he
knows where I'm coming from  now I know where he's coming from  And all
that I can do is pray for him as I've always done

I believe the reason that he  I click instead of bash heads is because
I see Christianity as a tool for revolution  not a tool for maintaining
the status quo  To be quite blunt I have more of a reason to reject God
than he does just by the fact that I am an AfricanAmerican female 
Christianity  religion have been used as tools to separate my people from
the true knowledge of our history  the wealth of our contributions to the
world society  The kitchen of heaven was all we had to look forward to
during the slave days  this mentality  secondclass status still exists
today  I too have rejected
an aspect of Christianitythat of the estabished church  Too much
hypocricy exists behind the walls of God's house beginning with the
images of a white Jesus to that of the members  praise God on Sunday 
raise hell beginning Monday  Godwilling I will find a church home where
I can feel comfortable  athome but I don't see it happening anytime
soon

	Fortunately my own personal theology which will probably not
fall into line with a lot others recognized God as a being both
without gender and posessing qualities of both genders as being both
a masculine and feminine force

That is not necessarily unorthodox  When Christians call God 'Father' 
we are using a metaphor  The Bible in one place refers to God as being
like a mother  God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal
sense God has some of the attributes of both the father metaphor is
usually used because for most people at most times it is the less
misleading of the two possibilities

In article Aprathosrutgersedu kilroygbororowanedu Dr Nancy's Sweetie writes
Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell president of
Moody Bible Institute

  We affirm the absolutes of Scripture not because we are arrogant
  moralists but because we believe in God who is truth who has revealed
  His truth in His Word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic
  importance of those absolutes

There has been a lot of discussion but so far nobody seems to have hit on
exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at

 lots of stuff deleted

This is where the arrogance of Christians arises many people believe
that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the
doctrines of Christianity  they are implicitly claiming that they are
infallible and that there is no possibility of mistake

Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake and that your thinking has led
you to a flawless conclusion is pretty arrogant

I agree with what Darren has to say here but would like to add a 
personal observation  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have 
with it is not a sense of personal certainty but a lack of respect for
others who come to differing conclusions  Clearly this is not just 
Christian vs NonChristian there is a whole spectrum of belief systems
within Christianity  I do not tend to argue with others about matters
of personal faith because like aesthetics it is not demonstable by
objective means  

Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal 
sovereignty  What bothers me is when others suggest that in these 
matters of faith their specific beliefs are not only true to them 
but are absolute and should be binding on others  It follows from this
that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth and thus 
anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing
the wrong path  This is the arrogance I see a lack of respect for the
honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God
Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others  It is
universalizing those matters of personal faith coupled by a proud
notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's that
leads to arrogance  In my honest and nonuniversal opinion

It is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own
ability to know the truth  There are also different paths in some
areas of practice  But I'd like to see more clarification about what
you mean when you reject the idea of saying their specific beliefs
are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on
others  If something is true it is true for everyone assuming that
the belief is something about God history etc  Of course something
of the form I believe that it's best for me not to xxx could be true
for some people and not others  I have suggested in the past that God
may be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are
But that doesn't mean I doubt that there is a difference between
true and false nor that I think there is no benefit in finding out
what is true  clh

       That argument would be more compelling if it were not for the
Ishtar eggs and Ishtar bunnies  Why mix pagan fertility symbols from the
worship of the pagan goddess of fertility with Biblical belief  What
would really be lost if all of you were to just drop the word Easter and
replace all such occurances with Resurrection Sunday  Would you not
show up for services if they were called Resurrection Sunday Services

This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what 
is God's will for his family without consulting his wife  God reveals 
His will to both the husband and the wife  There needs to be some 
degree of mutuality in decision making  Even those whose understanding 
of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the 
husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family  
One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband 
and to the husband through the wife


Jayne Kulikauskas jaynemmaltguildorg

I agree  God makes the husband the head of the house  But he surely
can't do it alone  He needs the help of his beloved wife whom the
Lord gave him

At least that's how it is in my house  I thank God for the beautiful
woman He has brought into my life  I couldn't lead without the help

Please feel free to correct me and give me some texts  As far as I can see the
only text which vaugely relates to jewish evangelism is found in Mt 
However since this is found only in Mt it cannot be dated before CE which

mhsulonestarutsaedu Melinda  Hsu    writes

I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance of
Christians and look forward to any responses  In my
encounters with Christians I find myself dismayed by their
belief that their faith is total truth  According to them
their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of
God and God is truth  thus they know the truth  This stance
makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own
hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way
Their way is the 'truth'

But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe
a particular way  That choice is part faith and part reason
but it seems to me a choice

  I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this

  I'll start with a parable
 
  A Christian woman hires a carpenter to build her a birdhouse  When he comes
over they begin talking about religion  So you believe that you understand
God he asks  Yes I do she replies  Then have him build you the 
birdhouse

  I don't think that Melinda is complaining about the basis of Christian 
belief  However there is a tendency among Christians to say I have all the 
answers because God gave them to me  This is simply not the case
  I believe that the Bible is inerrant  However our HUMAN interpretations of
the Bible are necessarily in error because we are human and imperfect  We
have to remember that we ALL make mistakes in faith and that because we are
human we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of God  To
claim as so many people do that the existence of the Bible allows us to
determine the answers to all questions is to claim that we humans can fully
understand God's will  This is hubris

     ps  If you do sincerely believe that a god exists why do you follow
it blindly  

     Do the words Question Authority mean anything to you

     I defy any theist to reply      

  ok  i don't follow god blindly  once long ago i questioned authority
to such a rabid point that i found questionauthorityrejectauthority
unquestioningly  i question authority all the time  but to forever
question is fruitlesseventually we have to consider whether there are
answers to the questions whether the authority say the bible in this
case has validity  basically to question authority does not necessarily
mean reject authority

 In the New Testament sorry I don't have a Bible at work and can't
 provide a reference women are instructed to be silent and cover
 their heads in church  Now this is scripture  By your definition 
 this is truth and therefore absolute  

Do women in your church speak  Do they cover their heads  If all 
scripture is absolute truth it seems to me that women speaking in and 
coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals  
Yet clearly women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare 
heads  At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew 
up in

Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth  And there are plenty of other examples
Can you reconcile this

The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about
the Bible which they don't actually believe or practice I've known
all sorts of Christians ranging from the trendiest of liberals to
the firebreathing fundamentalists and although many on the 
conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is
a perhaps the source of absolute truth I don't know of anyone
who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition
While I am not a Roman Catholic I believe this is close to the official
position of the RC church perhaps an RC would like to comment

The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in
terms of the social context of the time You would think the fact 
that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophatandcane 
and give you some big songanddance routine about why this 
other passages as well aren't directly applicable today would 
show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they 
actually practice are two different things but mostly it doens't

While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians
I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy in this
case making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually
put into practice But if we step back from the namecalling and
look at what people are attempting to say we see that they are trying
to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the
Christian faith So when people use such words or phrases as Word of
God inerrant infallibale The Manufacturer's Handbook The
only rule of faith and practice in the church today to describe the
Bible we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at
the mere words they use Some of the above descriptions are demostratably
false and others are selfcontradictory but in my experience people are
generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even
when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions A Biblical
example is from the garden of Eden where God asks Where are you and Adam
explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself If Adam had
answered God's words he would have said something like I'm here in this
tree The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these
words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif Most people
have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of
the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases
and explanations that others use

I hope this helps

The two historic facts that I think the most important are these

 If Jesus didn't rise from the dead then he must have done something
else equally impressive in order to create the observed amount of impact

 Nobody ever displayed the dead body of Jesus even though both the
Jewish and the Roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so
it would have discredited the Christians

 
  Michael A Covington         internet mcovingtaiugaedu

  The University of Georgia                fax          
  Athens Georgia  USA     amateur radio NTMI       

And the two simplest refutations are these

  What impact  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament
I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate and that
the recorded impact actually happened  I find it interesting that no other
contemporary source records an eclipse an earthquake a temple curtain
being torn etc  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection
is from the Pauline epistles none of which were written sooner than  years
after the supposed event

  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no
one knew where it was  I personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen by disciples or by graverobbers
Don't bother with the point about the guards  it only appears in one
gospel and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make
up in order to counter the graverobbing charge  The New Testament does
record that Jews believed the body had been stolen  If there were really
guards they could not have effectively made this claim as they did

insert deletion of unnecessary quote

Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure
from punishing people  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and
his angels

First of all God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing
people  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on
whom he will have compassion Ex   However if he enjoyed
punishing people and sending them to hell then why would he send Jesus
to seek and save that which was lost Luke 


To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with
the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed remember the Bible
teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement  Their
judgement is soon to come

Let me suggest this  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory
should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it  Stay away
from human theories and only take into account references in the bible

You asked for it

 Peter ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished
Matthew  is also very clear that those who do not righteous in
God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity
 Thessalonians  states that those who cause trouble for the
disciples will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out
from the presence of the Lord
 Thessalonians  talks about those who refuse to love the truth
being condemned
Revelation  talks about the difference between those who overcomes
and those who do not  Those who do not listed in verse  will be in
the fiery lake of burning sulfur
Revelation  gives the indication that those who follow the beast
will be tormented with burning sulfur and there being no rest day or
night for them because of it
Psalm   The wicked return to the grave all the nations that
forget God

I think those should be sufficient to prove the point

Joe Fisher

In the following I'm mostly playing devil's advocate  I'm not
advocating either position  My concern is that people understand that
it's possible to see these passages in different ways  It's possible
to see eternal destruction as just that  destruction  Rev often
uses the term second death  The most obvious understanding of that
would seem to be final extinction  The problem is that the NT speaks
both of eternal punishment and of second death  Ie it uses terms
that can be understood either way  My concern here is not to convince
you of one view or the other but to help people understand that
there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to
understand them either way  As Tom Albrecht commented the primary
point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire
whatever the details  To make things more interesting Luke 
implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all  Presumably
they just stay dead  yes I'm aware that it's possible to 
understand this passage in a nonliteral way

 Peter ff is talking about angels and talks about holding them
in hell until the final judgement  This isn't eternal punishement

Matthew  talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire
prepared for the devil and his angels  The fact that the fire is
eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever
Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been
prepared for the devil and his angels  Rev  and  talk about the
eternal fire as well  They say that the beast and the false prophet
will be tormented forever in it  When talking about people being
thrown into it  it is referred to as the second death
This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment  Is is possible
that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as
the devil and humans

 Thessalonians  similarly what is everlasting destruction
This is not necessarily eternal torment  This one can clearly be
understood either way but I think it's at least possible to think
that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction
that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in
eternity

 Thessalonians  again talks about destruction
Revelation  see comment above
Revelation  is probably the best of the quotes  Even there
it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever  It says
that the smoke and presumably the fire is eternal and that 
there is no respite from it  But it doesn't say that the people
are tormented forever

Psalm   I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue

DeonStrydomfnzfidonetorg Deon Strydom writes

Which brings me around to asking an open question  Is the Bible a closed
book of Scripture  Is it okay for us to go around saying God told
me this and Jesus told me that  Wouldn't that imply that God is STILL
pouring out new revelation to us  I know that some people will feel
that is okay and some will not  The concept of a closed canon would
certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets  On the other hand
an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes


Let's get back to basics  Canon from the latin means a rule  If
we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken  
There is an issue also of measurement against a rule  Thus the words
that are spoken need to be compared against the rulecanon but not
added to the canon

Is new revelation necessary  Topical current personal revelation
I'd say is necessary  New revelation for all people for all times
is not necessary as we have that in Scripture

You also seem to confuse canon with scripture  Scripture may speak of
itself being open  ie God speaking today  It would speak that it is
closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable  Though the concept
of canon is later historically

Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new
but rather an inspired translation of scripture  Is it right to call
that prophecy  Misleading  Wouldn't that be more having to do with
knowledge  I know the gift of knowledge may not be as exciting to
talk about but shouldn't we call a horse a horse


I agree with the problem of confusion  If prophecy is meant to encourage
exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture  If prophecy is
meant to bring a word' of the form the man you live with is not your
husband then that is knowledge  Yet the exact words their are scripture
I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery
The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force

There is no way out of the loop

Oh contrer mon captitan  There is a way  Certainly it is not by human reason
 Certainly it is not by human experience and yet it is both  To paraphrase
Sartre the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point  It
is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing 
Your logic comes to fruition in relativism  

At the core of all wellfounded belief lies belief that is unfounded
                                                     Ludwig Wittgenstein

Ah now it is clear  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell Ludwig's fame is often
explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in
contemporary philosophy Both revolve around Tractatus LogicoPhilosphicus
' and Philosophical Investigation '  Many of Witt's comments and
implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of
language he offers  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's
thought ordinary language is an invaluable resource offering a necessary
framework for the conduct of daily life  However though its formal features
remain the same its content does not and it is always capable of being
transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened giving
us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say  On Witt's own
account there is a dynamic fluidity of language   It is for this reason that
any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to
talking about its boundaries where a boundary is understood not as a wall but
a threshold
  vonWrights's comment that Witt's sentences have a content that often lies
deep beneath the surface of language  On the surface Witt talks of the
insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing
ourselves to accept it without question  At the same time we are faced with
Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes
in our traditional modes of understanding  Philosophy then through more
perspicacious speech seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it
is already functioning Yes  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to
offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity In his
Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse
of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man 
Perfect language does not exist for fallen man therefore we must get on about
our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language

  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians  It is so simple in
it conveyance of the revealation of God yet so full of unlieing depth of
understanding  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of as a man thinketh so
he is  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside
that is the consciousness of Christ  And so must we  Words are only vehicals
of truth  He is truth  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that
there is a Truth and that it is knowable  THere are absolutes and they too
are knowable  However they are only knowable when He reveals them to the
individual  There is and we shouldn't shy from this a mysticism to
Christianity  Paul in ROm  says there are  men in the world  There is the
one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the
Spirit the Spirit of Truth and there is the one who has the Spirit and has
the capacity to know of the Truth but there  is the third  THe one who not
only has the Spirit but that the Spirit has him Who can know the deep things
of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit  And it is only the deep
things of GOd that are absolute and true
   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real it can be experienced
and it is verifiable  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because
if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair  

I would know the words which He would answer me and understand what He would
say unto me  Job ff

Hi

I am new to this newsgroup and also fairly new to christianity I was
raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an
agnostic but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the
Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life I am
happy but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and
quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true This I am trying
to rectify by reading the Bible of course but it would be helpful
to also read a good interpretationcommentary on the Bible or other
relevant aspects of the Christian faith One of my questions I would
like to ask is  Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological
works intended for a lay person

I have another question I would like to ask I am not yet affiliated
with any one congregation Aside from matters of taste what criteria
should one use in choosing a church I don't really know the difference
between the various Protestant denominations

Thanks for reading my post 

Sincerely

Steve Hoskins

Aside from a commentary you might also want to consider an
introduction  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible
courses  They give historical background discussion of literary
styles etc  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further
reading  I typically recommend Kee Froehlich and Young's NT
introduction  There are also some good onevolume commentaries  They
often have background articles that are helpful  Probably the best
recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary  I
think there may be a couple of books with this title  This is a
fairly recent one like about  done in cooperation with the
Society for Biblical Criticism  If you are committed to inerrancy
you will probably prefer something more conservative  I don't read a
lot of conservative books but a commentary I looked at by Donald
Guthrie looked rather good  He has a NT Introduction and he's also
editor of Eerdman's Bible Commentary  clh

  Brothers and Sisters
  
    Being new to the faith and examining the Decalogue closely I've noticed the
  fourth commandment is pretty specific about keeping the Sabbath day  It
  states the th day Saturday  is the Sabbath while most Christian religions
  keep or atleast go to church  on Sunday  What's up
 
 This is a frequently asked question  Every time it arises it causes
 months of debate  So let me see if I can answer you directly
 Basically it's because the Law was given to Moses as part of a
 specific covenanent with the Jews  Most of us aren't Jews so we
 aren't part of that covenant  There was an argument early in
 Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to
 Gentiles who became Christians  You can see the account of this
 debate in Acts   The main question there was circumcision but
 keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well  The apostles
 concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians
 and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us

  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai  Rom
 notes that where no law is there is no transgression  Not only
did sin exist before Sinai Eden but the Sabbath was kept before it
was revealed on Sinai Ex 

  The problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise
which undergirded it  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the
people but in their ignorance after  years of slavery they promised
what ever He says to do we will do  That is why the new covenant is
based on better promises Heb   Rather than do away with the law
God promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their
hearts Heb 

  Including the Sabbath in the Acts  is selective inclusion  The
Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision  If any attempt
had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been
even more strident than is recorded in Acts   Do not confuse the weekly
Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at
any time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which was
added because of transgression of the moral law Gal 

  Israel stands for God's people of all time  That is why God grafted
the Gentiles in  Roma  says that the adoption the glory the
covenants the giving of the law the service of God and the promises
belong to Israelites   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born
into Israel is not enough For they are not all Israel which are of
Israel v   Then in Gal  he says if ye be Christ's then are ye
Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise  All Christians are
Abraham's seed Jews Israelites  Not physically for that is not the
criterion but spiritually  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the
promise God made to all his people the Israelites

 
 While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us
 because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews
 we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected
 from the Jews and the things he expects from us  After all it's the
 same God  However there are several ways of dealing with this
 
 These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments
 into moral and ceremonial  Ceremonial commandments apply only to
 the Jews  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant  These are
 thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision  Moral laws apply to
 everyone  Most of the  commands are part of the moral law except
 for the commandment about the Sabbath  I believe most people who take
 this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on
 the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law but a general obligation to
 worship regularly is part of the general moral law  Thus Christians
 are free to choose the specific time we worship

People would probably agree but they are wrong  How can the Sabbath
commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the
ceremonial laws  You are not free to choose your time of worship  Even
if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan
sun worship  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed
sanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders
agree has not biblical foundation see Sabbath Admissions in
socreligionchristianbiblestudy
 
 A more radical approach which is generally connected with John Calvin
 and the Reformed tradition says that the Law as a whole is no longer
 binding  Instead we are entirely under grace and our behavior
 should be guided solely by love  Portions of the OT Law are still
 useful as guidance  But they are not properly speaking legally
 binding on us  In practice most people who take this position do not
 believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce  While
 we may no longer be under Law as sinners it's not safe for us to go
 into situations with no principles to guide us  We're too good at
 selfjustification for that to be safe  Thus Christians do have moral
 guidance from things like Jesus' teachings Paul's advice etc
 These may not be precisely a Law but they serve much the same
 function as and have largely the same content as the moral law in
 the previous analysis  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed
 legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that
 given human weakness the discipline of regular worship is important
 
I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says  My guide is what God
says  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law
why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the
Sabbath commandment which is the only one God thought was important
enough to say REMEMBER  If you study the word deeply you will note that
the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but
freed by the grace of God  If a cop pulls me over for speeding then in
court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me
grace do I walk out of the court saying I can now go on speeding for I
am now under grace  Being under grace I now drive within the speed
limit  Paul adds to it in Rom  Di we then make void the law through
faith  God forbid yea we establish the law  Wherefore the law is
holy and the commandment holy and just and good Rom 

 In both analyses the specific day is not an issue  As a matter of
 tradition we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's
 resurrection  There's some debate about what Acts shows about early
 Christian worship  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish
 Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath but
 that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then
 Act  shows worship on the first day Sunday and I Cor  also
 implies gatherings on that day
 
 There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to
 worship on the Sabbath Saturday  The bestknown are the SeventhDay
 Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses  They argue that Act  is not a
 regular worship service but a special meeting to see Paul off and
 that I Cor  doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service

Do you prefer implication to fact  A careful study of the Acts  shows
that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did
not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to
Assos  In ICor  there is no way you can equate lay by him in store
with go to a worship service
 
 It's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul's time  See
 Rom   Paul's advice is that we should be very careful about
 judging each other on issues like this  One person sees a specific
 day as mandated by God while another does not  He who observes that
 specific day does it in honor of the Lord  He who believes his
 worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the
 Lord  Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue
 that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here  Note however Col
  which says something similar but briefer  It explicitly
 mentions Sabbath

Wrong  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the Sabbath
day of the moral law
 
 There are some differences among Christians about use of the word
 Sabbath  Originally the term referred to the th Day the Jewish
 day of worship  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday the
 day of Christian worship  They do this largely so that they can apply
 the th or whatever  there are a couple of different numbering
 schemes commandment to it  Reformed tradition does not do this  It
 distinguishes between the Sabbath  which is the observance mandated
 for Jews and the Lord's Day  which is the free Christian worship
 The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev   There
 are also differences about laws regarding this day  Many Christians
 support blue laws both in secular law and church law setting aside
 that day and causing people to spend it in worship  The more radical
 antilegal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish
 Sabbath which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the
 Lord's Day
 
Why would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different arguments
which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a
God who loved you enough to die for you  Jesus died because the law could
not be changed  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a
broken law if all you need to do is change the law  Penalties for law
breaking means the law is immutable  That is why it is no sin not to
follow the demands of the ceremonial laws  It will always be a sin to
make false gods to violate God's name to break the Sabbath to steal to
kill etc  Except it you disagree  But then your opinion has no weight
when placed next to the word of God

Darius

It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ  I
think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another Rom  is
probably all that needs to be said  I accept that Darius is doing
what he does in honor of the Lord  I just wish he might equally
accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing
their best to honor the Lord

However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous
proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day  As I
indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited

The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually
about something else  They both look like they are talking about
nnregular Christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they
gathered every Sunday for worship  We get various pieces of
information but nothing aimed at answering this question  

Act  describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple
worship and in Christian communion services in homes  Obviously the
temple worship is on the Sabbath  Acts  is an example of
Christians participating in them  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us
what day Christians met in their houses  Acts  despite Darius'
confusion is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday  I see no
reason to impose modern definitions of when days start when the
Biblical text is clear about what was meant  The wording implies to
me that this was a normal meeting  It doesn't say they gathered to
see Paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread
Paul talked about his upcoming travel  But that's just not explicit
enough to be really convincing  Similarly with  Cor   It says
that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's
collection  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially
to do this or that they did it in their homes I can't disprove it
but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be
when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do
it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day
So I think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day
of every week simply means every time they gather for worship  

I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements
is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian
worship was

In article Aprathosrutgersedu reedrcgsvaxclaremontedu writes

 I disagree with your claim that Jews were not evangelistic except in
 the narrow sense of the word  Jewish proselytism was widespread
 There are numerous accounts of Jewish proselytism both in the New
 Testament and in Roman and Greek documents of the day

I am not so sure of Jewish proselytism then but I would like to relate
an account of a recent dinner I had with Jews a few months ago

The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess whom I had met while
visiting my wife in Galveston last October  The dear old aunt now 
deceased was very proud of her Jewish heritage although not especially
devout  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in
Austria during WWII because they were Jewish  While conversing with her
about politics world affairs and religion she remarked that it would 
be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta

Within two days of returning to Atlanta her niece called to invite
me over for dinner with her husband  I went not knowing really what to
expect other than stimulating conversation and fellowship  What I got
however was rather unexpected  The thrust of the evening's discussion
was to condemn the ReaganBush policies prohibiting abortion counseling 
in federally funded family planning clinics prohibiting the sterilization
of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico on
the ban on fetal tissue research and against the Mexico City policy
which denies US foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion

The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of
overpopulation rampant domestic crime African starvation unwed
mothers etc on Christianity rather on the fall of Adam  Now this
is not what I had to come to talk about  But every time I tried to 
bring up the subject of Judaism they would condemn Jews for Jesus
and admonish me against converting to Judaism because it involves
too much study and effort  And I did not even raise the prospect nor
try to convert them to the truth of Christ  There was certainly no
Jewish proselytism going on there

And again last November I toured a traditional Jewish synagogue and was
subjected to a minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in
general  I realize that these are two isolated incidents and that the
best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish but from my experience
the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism

On the question Does God hear the prayers of sinners we need to
distinguish

If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned we
make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than  centuries
ago

But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner of someone
who says Lord I want you to do this for me but don't expect me
to change my way of life that is a different matter Even here I
would not venture to say that God never grants such petitions just
as He sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good However if
someone we know well is praying to God in that spirit we might have
the responsibility to say Remember if God's help is real then so
are His commands

A reply to a post by kilroygbororowanedu aka Nancy's Sweetheart 

Human brains are infested with sin and they can only be trusted
in very limited circumstances

I would beg to differ with you here  The properlyformed conscience can
be trusted virtually ALL the time  I am not so sure though about something
so materialistic as the human brain  Does that mass of tissue possess
anything trustworthy  Your observation would probably be valid if we were
discussing the mind of an animal but the human being is only half animal
as it were and half spiritual 

At the moment he stops speaking and people start interpreting the
possibility of error appears  Did he mean that literally or not  We do
not have any record that he elaborated on the words  Was he thinking of
Tran or Con substatiation   He didn't say  We interpret this passage
using our brains we think and reason and draw conclusions  But we know
that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us wrong  This
is something that most of us have direct experience of  

Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church  It is by necessity the
infallible interpreter of divine revelation  Without the Church          
Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects
 
Unless you are infallible there are very few things you can be certain
of  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking they
cannot be certain

This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a
conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience  It reminds me
of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of
a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying
to measure  Now the experimental physicist will reply that although the
measurement can never be made with absolute certainty he is able to
determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made and this
knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough
to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation
Therefore although our minds are finite and susceptible to error our
competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our
ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true even in areas
not subject to the experimental method

  I'm concerned about a recent posting about WBTSIL  I thought they'd
pretty much been denounced as a rightwing organization involved in
ideological manipulation and cultural interference including Vietnam
and South America A commission from Mexican Academia denounced them in
 as  a covert political and ideological institution used by the
US govt as an instrument of control regulation penetration espionage and
repression

Having met Peter Kingston of WBT some years back he struck me 
as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with
translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people
group he was serving
WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture
in minority languages

The sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this
along the lines of ideological manipulation and cultural
interference is probably no more than Christianising and
education  in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian
missionaries to parts of Africa or those groups who worked
among native Americans a couple hundred years ago

  My concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even
praiseworthy by readers of socreligionchristian It's important that
Christians don't immediately accept every Christian organization as
automatically above reproach

goodness that is within the power of each of us  Now the
complication is that one of my best friends has become very
fundamentalist That would normally be a nonissue with me but he

Hello  Firstly what do you exactly mean by fundamentalist  I will
for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes
that the bible is God's word to mankind  I suspect that what happened
to him is what he'll call being born again  Anyway was that recent
If the answer is yes to all the questions above it is quite
understandable  However IMO I'ld rather give advice to your friend
I think I've been through something similar to him and one thing I can
say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to
communicate from different worldviews  Why he talks about those things
is because they are now obvious to him  What is obvious to him is
not obvious to you  Secondly why he may be very persuasive is because
from his point of view he has been on both sides of the fence  This
I mean that before he turned fundamentalist you two are agreeable
because both of you see things from the same side  If suddenly as if
a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him it is like the
discovery of let's say a new continent or a new planet  To him he's
got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than
where he was and what he thinks is much better than where you are now
You have got to realise that from his point of view he means well to
you eventhough he may end up offending you  To him it is worth that
risk  Nevertheless it is really up to him to respect where you stand
and listen to you as well  At this moment it may be difficult because
he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about
however he may not realise that he's really putting you off



the Bible that it is so'  So my question is how can I convince him
that this is a subject better left undiscussed so we can preserve
what is in all areas other than religious beliefs a great
friendship  How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he
won't try  Thanks for any advice

So far I've only been trying to explain things from his side  However
I do understand how you feel too because I wasn't a Christian for a good
part of my life as well  I was quite turned off by Christians or
fundamentalists who were really all out and enthusiastic about their
faith  They really scared me to tell you the truth  Unfortunately
religious belief is a very personal thing just as your agnosticism
is also a very personal thing to you  Since the Christian belief is
inevitably at odds with anything nonChristian religious or otherwise
it will be a touchy matter  Like all friendships it will take both
sides to do their part to make it work  In this matter maybe you can
do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's
trying to convince you about that it's beyond you or not your concern
for now  Don't tell him it's nonsense because to him it is reality 
and that would be a real insult  He'll also have to be careful not to
insult where you stand too

Like I said before I wish I could give your friend some advice too
I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a
Christian  In some ways I wish I could have done things a little
differently  However it was difficult then because I was so excited
and just blabbered away about what I've found  To me it was too good
not to know  To some I was crazy and I didn't really care most of
the time what they thought  You will probably think he's crazy too 
but God is very real to him as real as you are to him  Keep that in
mind  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real
to him he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too

I don't know how helpful this is to you  But all the best anyhow 
this is quite a challenge for you to face  By the way personal
conviction nobody is beyond saving except the one we call the 
devil and his hosts

I don't know if this is the sort of thing you guys like
to discuss  I guess it falls into the area of apologetics

This is a question that seems to pop up now and again in
conversations with nonchristians  It usually appears in
the following sort of unqualified statement
Well you know that religion has caused more wars than
anything else
It bothers me that I cannot seem to find a satisfactory
response to this After all if our religion is all about
peace and love why have there been so many religious wars
  Personally I am of the view that religion has often been
used as an excuse to instigate wars often to disguise
national ambitions but I would love to hear what anyone
else has to say about this subject

  Are all truths also absolutes
  Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes
  
  The answer to both questions is yes
 
  
 an absolute is something that is constant across time culture
 situations etc  True in every instance possible  Do you agree
 with this definition 
 
 Yes I do agree with your definition  
  
  example of women covering their heads and not speaking
 
 Hold it  I said that all of scripture is true  However discerning
 exactly what Jesus Paul and company were trying to say is not always so
 easy  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should
 behave that way  Rather he was trying to say that under the circumstances
 at the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and
 cover their heads  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward
 others  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived
 from absolutes  For instance it is absolutely right for Christians to
 strive for peace  However this does not rule out trying to maintain world
 peace by resorting to violence on occasion  Yes my opinion

I agree that there is truth in scripture  There are principles to be 
learned from it  Claiming that that truth is absolute though seems 
to imply a literal reading of the Bible  If it were absolute truth 
constant across time culture etc then no interpretation would be 
necessary

It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different 
from person to person  To me that doesn't mean that one person is 
right and the other is wrong  I believe that God transcends our simple 
minds and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly 
this intent  God knows me and knows that my needs are different 
from yours or anyone else's  By claiming that scripture is absolute
then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong
I just don't believe that God is that rigid

 Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
 to be absolute truth  And there are plenty of other examples
 Can you reconcile this

 Sure  The Bible preaches absolute truths  However exactly what those
 truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion  As I said the Bible does
 preach absolute truths  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal
 clear at least to evangelicals  

This is where the arrogance comes in to play  Since these principles 
are crystal clear to evangelicals maybe the rest of us should just take
their word for it  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to me that 
their fundamental principles are either fundamental or principles

I think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter 
of human interpretation and therefore errorprone  Yet you can still 
claim that some of them may be crystal clear  Maybe to a certain 
segment of Christianity but to all

 It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based 
 on your own interpretation is absolute  
 
 God revealed his Truths to the world through His Word  It is utterly 
 unavoidable however that some people whill come up with alternate 
 interpretations  Practically anything can be misinterpreted especially
 when it comes to matters of right and wrong  Care to deny that

Not at all  I think it supports my position much more effectively 
than yours  

So I think that your position is
The Bible is absolute truth but as we are prone to error in our 
interpretation we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out 
what that truth is
Did I get that right

What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending 
absolute truth when we can never know what those truths are and we 
can never or at least shouldn't act upon them  What practical 
difference can this make

 This is not true Science is a collection of models telling us how
 not why something happens I cannot see any good reason why the why
 questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the
 supernatural domain exists If supernatural beings exist it is
 as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist

I beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models
Scientific models are a game to play and are only as good as the
assumptions and measurements if any that go into them

As an example I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in
atmospheric science  It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that
one of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of
the nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder  He decided to assume
that the atmosphere is more like a twodimensional thing than a one
dimensional thing  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds
blow in the real atmosphere  On returning to Georgia Tech he showed
a transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they
were generated by the models  There was an unmistakable correlation
between the age meaning simplicity of assumptions ie remoteness
from reality of each model and the degree of cooling  Whereas Sagan's
model showed an approximate degree cooling episode the next model 
in sophistication showed about half that and so on until we got to
our boy's model which showed a  degree drop if the war happened in
the winter and less than a  degree drop if it happened in the summer
He predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans chemistry
the biosphere and other indicators of reality in the models we would
probably see even less cooling  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even
less than a nuclear autumn one might say to a nuclear fizzle

To quote from HS Yoder

	The postulated models have become accepted as the reality
	instead of the lattice of assumptions they are
	Authoritarianism dominates the field and a very critical
	analysis of each argument is to be encouraged Skepticism
	of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because
	many key parameters have not been included

This statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony  Only when
convincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results
may one suggest that the model may describe the reality  Just thought
I'd clear that up before things really got out of hand

Hello all  We are doing a bible study at my college on Revelations  We
have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable
interpretation  We are now on chapters  and  which talk about the
woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon  I believe the beast is the
Antichrist some may differ but it seems obvious and the woman represents
Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church  What are some
views on this interpretation  Is the falling Babylon in chapter  the same
Babylon in as in chapter   The Catholic church

Reading this imagery as the Roman Catholic Church was certainly
common in earlier Protestant writers  A lot of us find that frankly
embarassing now though some of our readers will certainly advocate
such a position  The problem is that the description makes it look a
lot like a political entity  It's associated with kings controls
world commerce is seated on seven mountains   recall that Rome
is traditionally regarded as built on seven hills  If it's a church
then it's not the current Roman Catholic church but a church that has
been taken over by the antiChrist and merged with the state turning
into something rather different than it is now  Presumably in such a
scenario the true Catholics are among those who are persecuted  Given
the overall impression that Satan is pretending to be an angel of
light and the true church is a persecuted remnant I think the most
consistent playing out of the image would be that the antiChrist
would be presiding over a church that claims to be the heir of both
the Protestant and Catholic traditions but that the true spiritual
descendants of both Peter and the Reformers are equally being
persecuted  clh

As our localreligionchristian BBS group seems moribund I'm posting here

On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church  The sermon was
based on a story in the Book of Joshua  The one about Joshua sending out
spies to the land he was planning to take  What I particularly remember
because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia was that
the Rahab the woman who sheltered the spies said that the people were
melting in fear  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and
knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war I felt
uncomfortable  After all the Serbs are driving nonChristians out  On
the other hand ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values
held by our secular society  Anyhow members of that church are involved in
outofcountry missionary work  Also the pastor has talked of spiritual
warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area

The next Sunday the sermon was about Joshua  where the Israelites
take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there  except
for Rahab who had sheltered the spies  With those reports about
Bosnia in my mind I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that
the massacre the one in Joshua was right  But what really bothered
me was that if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously I
shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of ethnic cleansing in
Bosnia  Certainly my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims
Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians
who under Turkish rule converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing
God's work

The example of God's people setting out on bloody wars of conquest
has always been troubling in discussions here  I personally question
whether they were right even at the time  But those who believe they
were consider that the wars were justified only because they were
specifically commanded by God  Somehow I don't see the Serbs behaving
like a group that is led by God in this matter  clh

     ps  If you do sincerely believe that a god exists why do you follow
it blindly  
     Do the words Question Authority mean anything to you
     I defy any theist to reply      

Dear Defiant or Unfaithful or Pixie

I will take up the challenge to reply as I am a theist

The foundation for faith in God is reason without which the existence
of God could not be proven  That His existence can be proven by reason
is indisputable cf my short treatise Traditional Proofs for the 
Existence of God and Summa Theologica

Now given that God exists and that His existence can be proven by reason
I assert that His commands must be followed blindly although in our fallen
condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith  Why

Because God is the First Cause of all things the First Mover of matter
the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence the
Measure of all that is perfect and the essential Being who gives order
to the universe logos

I next assert that God is all good  If this is so then that which is
contrary to the will of God is evil ie the absence of the good  And
since God can never contradict Himself then by His promise of a Savior
as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis  God instructs that because
a human Adam was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source
of all good a man would be required to act to restore the friendship
Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah

Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth John   If this claim
is true then we are bound by reason to follow Him who is truth incarnate

You next seem to have a problem with authority  Have you tried the United
States Marine Corps yet  I can tell you firsthand that it is an excellent
instructor in authority  If you have not yet had the privilege I will
reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned
and thus must be followed blindly  One may NOT deny the truth  For
example when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head he could
have denied that it happened but he did not  The laws of physics must
be obeyed whether a human likes them or not  They are true 

Therefore the Authority which is Truth may not be denied

QED

 Another answer is that God is the source of all existence
 This sounds much better but I am tempted to ask Does God
 Himself exist then If God is the source of His own existence
 it can only mean that He has in terms of human time always
 existed But this is not the same as the source of all existence
 This argument sounds like God does not exist but metaexists
 and from His metaexistent perspective He created existence
 I think this is actually a nonsolution a mere twist of words

Always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beings
is not problematic

But as you put Being the source of all existence including one's own
would mean that God came from nothing a concept alien to Christianity and
Theism  It is better to understand the classical concepts of Necessary and
Contingent existence  God exists necessarily always  God created
contingent beings  This is a coherent solution to existence so long as
the concept of God is coherent
 
 The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable
 of understanding such questions Being an atheist myself I do not
 accept such answers since I do not have any other methods

Not a very good answer  If reason cannot by any means understand something
then it is likely that it is a null concept something not in reality

the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such

die with your physical body why would flame hurt you  How can one wail
and gnash teeth with no lungs and no teeth

One can feel physical pain by having a body which if you know the

My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after
his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman about twelve years ago
We've kept things on a painfully polite Christmascard sort of level
for most of this time Attempts to see each other end disastrously with
his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined
slights to her or his inattention or insensitivity to her I mean this'll
happen by the end of a single restaurant meal He seems from what I've
seen to live in a state of quivering anxiety hoping futilely to keep
the next storm from breaking He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact
with us but also other friends and outside interests Now this is his
choice and I need to accept it even if I deplore it But it's hard
   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a
relationshipby cutting off contactor trying to have a real if painful
relationship by talking honestly with him but I've always thought Why
be dramatic And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse
to get off the phone Just leave the door open in case he ever decides to
come back It's been an unsatisfying choice to allow us to go on
with the superficial trappings of a relationship but it was the best I
could think of
   Now this weekend my mother finally decided that she wasn't going
to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them This was the
outcome of a phone conversation in which my sisterinlaw screamed and
raved at my mother blaming her for everything wrong in their lives and
in which my brother evaded temporized claimed the situation was
beyond his control and as always expected my mother to make all the
allowances and concessions Mom said she would not that she would not
quietly take abuse any more and that if these were the terms of their
relationship she didn't want to talk to or see them any more And she hung
up I have never seem my mother lose her temper and I think that this is
the first time she's ever hung up on someone Mom says she feels as if
she's divorced my brother and that it's a relief in some ways to have the
break out in the open and done with
 
    I have mixed feelings I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself
angry at my brother and sisterinlaw for hurting her for being jerks for
persisting in such a wretched life which hurts us all and is warping their
children angry at my sisterinlaw for being so hateful and angry at my
brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us
that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to
appease an unappeasable
emotionally disturbed woman pained for their children who are a mess
scared for the future since this marks the time when either things will
change and improve or the break will become irrevocable nastily self
righteous over this bit of proof that they can't get away with treating
us or each other this way and then disgusted with myself for even
beginning to gloat over others' misery and finally mostly sad sad
sad to see my parents hurt and my brother and sisterinlaw trapped in
a horrible destructive situation that they can't see a way out ofor
they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see And I'm frustrated
because I don't know what if anything to do and doing nothing drives me
up the wall I try to pray about my own feelings of rage impotence
and vindictiveness and about their situation but I am not
free of the desire to DO something concrete The desire to DO
something to define a problem and fix it is one of my besetting
vices I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal
mental chatter enough to listen for God
  Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me Is
this a time to reach out to my brother To let things be How can I
conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him
 
Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long long
post Is it ok as a Christian and a proponent of faith hope and
charity to accept the destruction of a relationship To give up on
my own brother or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him
and can only wait and see what happens Do please answerby email or
post
 
Thank you

   For example why does the universe exist at all  
 
 Whether there is a why or not we have to find it This is Pascal's wager
 If there is no why and we spend our lives searching then we have merely
 wasted our lives which were meaningless anyway If there is a why and we
 
  I find this view of Christianity to be quite disheartening and sad
 The idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a Creator
 does not seem like much of a basis for belief

Please forgive all the inclusions I suppose they are neccessary to follow
the argument

My point is that if life has meaning or importance then we should try
to find that meaning or importance which is almost a tautology I hope
I'm not being too patronizing One term for that meaning is Creator
though that is not obvious from my above argument

  And the logic is also appalling God must exist because I want Him to

It's more like I think therefore I am therefore God is

  I have heard this line of reasoning before and wonder how prevalent
 it is Certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is
 hopeless or so the pollsters and newscasts state but I don't see
 where this is a good reason to become religious If you want 'meaning'
 why not just join a cult such as in Waco The leaders will give you
 the security blanket you desire

Unfortunately the term religious is ambiguous to me in this context
I could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being
religious I could say cult followers by definition have given up on 
the search

If you want meaning why not search for the truth

So far my understanding of Christianity is congruent with my understanding
of truth There have been many before me who have come to conclusions 
that are worded in ways that make sense to me By no means does that imply
that I understand everything

 I think you are vastly oversimplifying things We know that early Christians
 suffered totures because of their witness to Christ  For example

 ACT    

 It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion
 to even hearing Jesus's name

 Finally the first apostle's death James of Zebedee was certainly
 not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen 

 The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection then one
 must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He
 stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth  That would
 have been extremely difficult for some people especially those
 that had plotted to kill Him 

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on
the biblical text  Luke's account is highly suspect I would refer you to
the hermeneia commentary on Acts  Moreover Luke's account is written at
least  years after the fact  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died
and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up
with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established
Moreover Pauls account of some of the events in Acts as recorded in 
Galatians fail to establish the acts accounts 

What we need therefore is a reliable text critically appreciated which
documents the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection  I would
suggest you look at some greek and roman historians  I think you will be
disapointed

I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is
ever disproved 
 
 Didn't Paul write that if the Resurrection is not true we are the
 biggest fools of all  However whether you believe in Christ or not
 His teachings eg love your brotherman as yourself even if only 
 followed at a secular level could do a great deal to alleviate some of 
 the problems we see today in the world  Even when I was a rabid atheist 
 I couldn't deny that

We also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been
wrecked on our world because of Christians  who were certain they were
following Christ  From Captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict
obedience to the Gensis command to subdue the earth to Nazi's who have
justly
punished the Jews for the killing Christ as well as the other progroms the
innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with you shall not allow a
witch to live the Moslems who were killed in the Crusades the godfearing
men destroyed by the inquistion  The religious wars in Spain France England
etc  Christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss
of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the
instructions therein was unquestionable  There is much to grieve

Dear fellow netters

From time to time a term like 'Oneness Pentecostals' or something
similar has occurred in posts to this group I also know that there
is a movement called something like 'Jesus alone' 

I believe in the Trinity and have no plans to change that but reently
I was made aware that there is at least one person within our church
who holds the view that there is no trinity In the near future we
will discuss this item and I feel that I shall ask you my friends on
this group for background information

Can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there
is only Jesus And vice versa The foundations for the Trinity

I shall appreciate both quotes from the Bible and historical
development

Thank you all

In Him

 Of course they knew where it was Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both
 the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker Pilate was no fool and didn't 
 need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to 
 make it appear He had arisen Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a 
 man well know to the Sanhedrin to say that they didn't know where He was
 buried begs the question

Here again the problem with most of the individuals posting here you take the
biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the
modern sense  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book The Cross That
Spoke Pub Harper and Row   The earliest texts which we have make no
reference to an empty tomb  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of
resurrection Modern EvangelicalsFundamentalists have completely missed what
the point of resurrection is  Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work 
Resurrection Immortality and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism Publ
Cambridge Havard Univ Press  is most helpful  Look At Rom   Paul
here has no need of an empty tomb  Additionally in  Cor  Here again there
is no mention of an empty tomb He was raised note the passive he appeared
no ascension either

Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the
grave  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts
until well after the fall of Jerusalem  By that time the idea of coming up
with a body would have been ludicrious  Moreover Mack has argued convicingly
I think that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark we have no texts
before this which mention the tomb 
    

 
 Now you say that you think that the disciples stole the body But think on
 this a moment Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a 
 deliberate lie If not then why do you think the disciples would Now I'm
 not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth 
 but unbeknown to you it is a lie Many have done this No I'm talking about
 dying by beheading stoning crucifixion etc for something you know to
 be a lie Thus you position with regards to the disciples stealing the 
 body seems rather lightweight to me
 
 As for graverobbers why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over 
 the body of Jesus He wasn't buried with great riches So again this is
 an argument that can be discounted
 
 That leaves you back on square one What happened to the body
 
 
 Again let me comment that the most plausible nonChristian scenario
 and the one typically suggested by sceptics who are knowledgeable
 about the NT is that the resurrection was a subjective event and the
 empty tomb stories are a result of accounts growing in the telling
 clh

You are quite right here  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the
foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable

 Religion especially Christianity is nothing more than a DRUG

There is a certain truth to this statement Only I would use the word
medicine instead of drug  With regard to the condition of the human
soul Christianity is first and foremost a healing medicine  It also
strengthens and enables one as healing takes hold to grow in new
strength and health to live and be and to do that for which God created 
us

 Some people use drugs as an escape from reality  

Christ's medicine rightly allowed to work brings one nearer to
reality and offers the clarity of understanding and the strength
of spirit with which to meet it in a healthy human way

 Christians inject themselves with Jesus and live with that high

I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned
     and the trumpet had blown
I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment
     before the white throne
Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate
They cried for the rock and the mountains
They prayed but their prayers were too late
The soul that had put off salvation 
Not tonight I'll get saved by and by
 No time now to think of  religion 
Alas he had found time to die
And I saw a Great White Throne

If I believed in the God of the bible I would be very fearful of making
this statement Doesn't it say those who judge will be judged by the
same measure 

Now some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for
motivation yet Jesus thought it was  Paul thought it was  Paul said 
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men

A God who must motivate through fear is not a God worthy of worship
If the God Jesus spoke of did indeed exist he would not need hell to
convince people to worship him

Today too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of
it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship  We don't tell people anymore that
there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell  

It was the myth of hell that made me finally realize that the whole thing
was untrue If it hadn't been for hell I would still be a believer today
The myth of hell made me realize that if there was a God that he was not
the all knowing and all good God he claimed to be Why should I take such
a being at his word even if there was evidence for his existance

Another issue of importance  Was the crucification the will of God or
a tragic mistake  I believe it was a tragic mistake  God's will can
never be accomplished through the disbelief of man  Jesus came to
this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth  He
desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah  If
the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this
cup pass from him  Was this out of weakness  NEVER  Many men and
women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes
Is Jesus less than these  No he is not  He knew the crucification
was NOT the will of GOD  God's will was that the Jewish people accept
Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on
the earth with Jesus as it's head Just like the Jewish people
expected If this had happened  years ago can you imagine what
kind of world we would live in today  It would be a very different
world  And that is eactly what GOD wanted  Men and women of that age
could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on
the earth  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would
have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to
live with GOD  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to
wait for Christ's return  But when he returns will he be recognized
and will he find faith on this earth  Isn't it about time for his
return  It's been almost  years

The two historic facts that I think the most important are these

 If Jesus didn't rise from the dead then he must have done something
else equally impressive in order to create the observed amount of impact

 Nobody ever displayed the dead body of Jesus even though both the
Jewish and the Roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so
it would have discredited the Christians

And the two simplest refutations are these

  What impact  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament
I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate and that
the recorded impact actually happened  I find it interesting that no other
contemporary source records an eclipse an earthquake a temple curtain
being torn etc  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection
is from the Pauline epistles none of which were written sooner than  years
after the supposed event

  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no
one knew where it was  I personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen by disciples or by graverobbers
Don't bother with the point about the guards  it only appears in one
gospel and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make
up in order to counter the graverobbing charge  The New Testament does
record that Jews believed the body had been stolen  If there were really
guards they could not have effectively made this claim as they did

for SRC

In most languages the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is
known as the PASCH or PASQUE or some variation thereof a word
which comes from the Hebrew PESACH meaning Passover In English
German and a few related languages however it is known as EASTER
or some variation thereof and questions have been asked about the
origin of this term

One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE
RATIONE TEMPORUM  where he derives the word from the name of an
AngloSaxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE Bede is a great
scholar and it is natural to take his word for it But he lived
 and Augustine began preaching in Kent in  The use of
the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well
established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth
of anyone he might have discussed the subject with It seems likely
that his derivation is just a guess based on his awareness that
there had been an AngloSaxon goddess of Spring bearing that name
and the resemblance of the words Thus if the said resemblance
surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should
have a name similar to the word for Dawn is not in istelf
convincing the testimony or rather the conjecture by Bede does
not make it more so

Assuming that Bede was right that would not justify saying that the
Christian celebration which after all had been going on for some
centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it has pagan roots
It would simply mean that the AngloSaxons upon becoming Christians
and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every
spring called it by the name that to them meant simply Spring
Festival

However Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed  J
Knoblech in Die Sprach ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 
Vienna   offers the following derivation

Among Latinspeaking Christians the week beginning with the Feast
of the Resurrection was known as hebdomada alba white week
since the newlybaptized Christians were accustomed to wear their
white baptismal robes throughout that week Sometimes the week was
referred to simply as albae Translaters rendering this into
German mistook it for the plural of alba meaning dawn They
accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM which is Old High German for
dawn This gave rise to the form EASTER in English

No I'm not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety
of celebrating Easter  However this seems like it contains enough
interesting information that people might like to see it  clh

Hi everyone 
	   I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem  I know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying' You fools
do you still think that just believing is enough'

Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by God according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith
But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to
him ie doesn't know him  condemned so a lukewarm Christian someone who
knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible

Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do
as taught in Romans but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spatout'

Can anyone help me this really bothers me

In Christ
Will

  The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted
  the Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the
  first day of the week was that this was when they received their
  weekly wages

But the ancient Romans did not observe a sevenday week  Unless a
man was working for a Jewish employer he is unlikely to have been
paid on the first day of a sevenday week Nor would a Jewish
employer have kept his wages over the weekend see Lev  Dt

  If you know the Latin one really beautiful way to hear the

This is done in English same music as the traditional Latin in

According to mdbsmsukyedu muslims tithe  of their income

Perhaps there are some offshoots of Islam that impose this on their
followers  But the standard tithe is  of one's net worth once
a year

The same writer also objects to the Bible for teaching that

  woman was created after man to be his helper etc

This is presumably a reference to Genesis  Suppose that that
chapter had been written with the sexes reversed We have God
creating woman and then saying It is not good that woman should
be alone I will make a help meet for her Feminists would be
outraged The clear implication would be that God had started at the
bottom and worked up making first the plants then the fish and
birds then the beasts then woman and finally His masterpiece the
Male Chauvinist Pig The statement that woman is not capable of
functioning by herself that she needs a man to open doors for her
would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult The fact
that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given
only briefly and in general while the creation of the Man was given
in six times the number of words would have been cited as evidence
of the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes
The verdict would have been unequivocal No selfrespecting woman
can accept this book as a moral guide or as anything but sexist
trash I suggest that Moses fearing this reaction altered his
original draft and described the creation with Adam first and then
Eve so as to appease Miriam and other radical feminists of the day
For some reason however it did not work

 It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it  Actions
 prove our faith and show the genuineness of it

A good example of this is Abraham referred to in the James passage Hebrews
says that Abraham was justified by faith  but his faith was demonstrated
through his works ie he obeyed what God told him to do

Reading Abraham's biography'' in Genesis is very instructive He was a man
beset by lack of faith a lot of the time eg lying about Sarah being his
wife on  occasions trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by
copulating with Hagar   yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the
basis of individual incidents Abraham is listed as one of the heroes of 
faith'' in Hebrews  ie when it really came to the crunch God declared
Abraham as a man of faith He believed God's promises

This gives us confidence Although real faith demonstrates itself through
works God is not going to judge us according to our successfailure in
performing works

Not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy
he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
Spirit'' Titus

Hi I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame thanx
in advance

I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible There
is this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says
contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies   

					Thanx in advance Shaz

I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions
The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style
of the translation  It's pretty unusual to see significant
differences in meaning  There are a few differences in the underlying
text  That's because before printing manuscripts were copied by
hand  Slight differences resulted  There are enough manuscripts
around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the
original but there are some uncertainties  Fortunately they are
generally at the level of minor differences in wording  There are
something like  or  places where whole sentences are involved
but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts I don't think there's
much uncertainly about those cases  As far as I know no Christians
believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of
translating is free of error  But I also don't think there's
enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that
it has much practical effect

Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot
topic of debate here  Many Christians deny it  Some accept it
though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details
that don't affect the faith  But this has nothing to do with there
being multiple versions  The supposed inconsistences can be found in
all the versions  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the
title page though  What version are you talking about  I've been
referring to major scholarly translations  These are what get
referenced in postings here and elsewhere  There have certainly been
editions that are to be kind less widely accepted  This includes
everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into
single narrations to editions that omit material that the editor
objects to for some reason or the other  The copyright on the Bible
has long since expired so there nothing to stop people from making
editions that do whatever wierd thing they want  However the editions
that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from
a variety of backgrounds with lots of crosschecks  I could imagine
one of the lesserknown editions claiming to have fixed up all
inaccurate data and inconsistencies  But if so it's not any edition
that's widely used  The widely used ones leave the text as is
Weeeeelllllll almost as is  It's been alleged that a few
translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize
inconsistencies  Because translation is not an exact science there
are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best
I'm afraid

	   I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem  I know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying' You fools
do you still think that just believing is enough'

Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand
what these passages say  First what is faith  If you study the 
meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will
come to the conclusion that the word means a lot more than mere 
belief  Faith means both trust and action  If you do not put your 
belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith  I think this 
is what James means when he says that faith without works is dead 
and I will show you my faith by my works  Remember James was 
writing to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad  This 
probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much 
later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek
Indeed I suspect James was writing to us today among others he
intended to reach  Paul on the other hand wrote mostly to the
people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of
the Greek

Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's
statements in their context  I think you will find that when Paul
contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the
gospel with the Law meaning the Law of Moses  This was the great
burden of Paul's life  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go
convert a bunch of people then the Judizers would come along and
try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses cf
Acts chapter   In this context Paul condemns the idea of being
saved by the works of the Law saying that we are saved by the blood
of Jesus and our faith in him  I believe that a better translation
for today would be that we are saved by faithfulness  I think
faithfulness today has a meaning closer to what the original
writers intended

Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by God according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith

I think you misunderstand Romans  What Paul is really saying is
that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not keep kosher to a
kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters
of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows

But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to
him ie doesn't know him  condemned so a lukewarm Christian someone who
knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible

In the sense of faith described above you cannot have real faith and 
be lukewarm  If you know God but are lukewarm unfaithful you are 
worse off than the person who never heard of Him  Remember Jesus in
the parable of the pearl of great price Mat  and again in
the one on the treasure hidden in the field Mat  indicates that
the price of the Kingdom of God is all we have

I agree with you in general including the fact that pistis has
some of the force of faithful  However if you take that too far
you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have
intended  Being faithful means following God in all things  To say
that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we
are saved by commiting no sins  I assume that's not what you meant

I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that
completely captures this  However I think Paul is describing what I'd
call a basic orientation including aspects such as trust and
commitment  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth which implies a basic
change  We may still do things that are sinful and may fail to show
the new life in Christ in many situations where we should  But in any
Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that
Jesus calls being born again

  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior you're taking an awful

Dirty Harry said You've got to ask yourself 'Do I feel lucky'  Well do

This is a ridiculous argument for being a Christian  So then you might 
consider switching from Christianity to another religion if you were 
offered an even more frightening description of another hell  How many
Christians do think there are who view it strictly as an insurance policy
Not many I know they believe in a message of love and compassion for 
others  A faith based on fear of hell sounds like a dysfunctional 
relationship with God  Like a child who cringes in fear of a parent's
physical violence  

Many religions have concrete views of heaven and hell with various
threats and persuasions regarding who will go where  Competition over
who can envison the worst hell can hardly nurture the idea of loving
your neighbor as yourself

Regarding Jesus only believers our moderator writes

   There may be some misunderstanding over terms here

I agree  Quite likely actually

                                                      I believe Jesus
   only originally was in the context of baptism  These are folks who
   believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only
   Jesus rather than Father Son and Holy Spirit  This may have
   doctrinal implications but as far as I know it does not mean that
   these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father  I'm not the
   right one to describe this theology and in fact I think there may be
   several including what would classically be called monophysite or
   Arian two rather different views as well as some who have beliefs
   that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards but who won't
   use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply
   because it is not Biblical  clh

Not Biblical  What then can they make of the end of Matthew

And Jesus came and said to them All authority in heaven and on
earth has been given to me Go therefore and make disciples of all
nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit  and teaching them to obey everything that I
have commanded to you  And remember I am with you always to the end
of the age Other ancient authorities add Amen NRSV

The notes give no sense that this is emended  Do other texts
contradict this regarding Baptism  Or is a misunderstanding of the
Trinity the most likely explanation after all

But maybe I simply misunderstand their views  Is anyone else out there
forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged
dictionary  Christianity really is an education in itself



David R Tucker		KGS		     drtathenamitedu


Arrgggghhhh  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian
language as unBiblical I was speaking of Trinitarian theology things
like one essense and three persons  Obviously the threefold
baptismal formula is Biblical as you point out  I normally use the
term threefold in referring to Mat  While it is certainly
consistent with belief in the Trinity the Trinity is a doctrine whose
full formulation occurred in the th and th Cent's  It's unlikely
that Mat had in mind the fullydeveloped Trinitarian doctrine
Indeed the threefold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do
not believe in the Trinity  The disagreement over baptismal formulae
occurs because of passages such as Acts  which command baptism in
the name of Jesus  There are a couple of other passages in Acts as
well  This leaves us with sort of a problem we're commanded in Mat
to baptize in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus

Jesus only groups baptize in the name of Jesus  They consider this
consistent with Mat  because they say that Jesus is the name of
the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit  I'm not the right one to
ask to explain what this means  I will simply say that it does not
appear to be normal Trinitarian theology  It is also an odd way of
dealing with the idiomatic phrase in the name of

Those who use the threefold formula don't seem to have a standard
answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus
I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that in the name
of need not be a verbal formula  To say that you baptize in the name
of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'
authority  In the st Cent context it contrasts Christian baptism
with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism  Of course there's a
certain parallelism between these passages  That suggests that we
could just as well say that Mat  doesn't require the specific
threefold formula to be used in baptism but simply characterizes
baptism done by those who follow the Father Son and Holy Spirit

One might well suspect that in the early church more than one
baptismal formula was used  So long as we consider following Jesus to
be the same as following the Father Son and Holy Spirit no great
damage would be done by such a difference  This does not mean that
I think we should go back to using both formulae  Baptism is one of
the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize
mutually so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in
the interests of the Gospel  This is reinforced by the fact that
those groups that actually use in the name of Jesus now do seem to
have in mind a difference in doctrine  But as I've said before I'm
not the one to explain what their doctrine is

	My problem with Science is that often it allows us to
assume we know what is best for ourselves  God endowed us
with the ability to produce life through sexual relations

You assume this because you believe in a designing creator
and you observe our ability to procreate

for example but He did not make that availible to everyone
Does that mean that if Science can override God's decision
through alterations that God wills for us to have the power
to decide who should and should not be able to have 
children

 But then you observe our ability to modify fertility
through intelligence  experiment and draw no similar conclusions
about God designing us for scientific inquiry  the use of the
technology that it produces  How is it that one ability is obviously
from God and the other not

	I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I
would approve of Scientific study and where I would not
but I will say this  Before one experiments with the
universe to find out all its secrets one should ask
why they want this knowledge

I want to know the truth and hold the Truth as the most
basic of all ethical values because correct moral judgement
relies on knowing the truth not vice versa Moralities that
assert that assent to a belief is a moral choice and not
compelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon
Falsification of evidence conscious and unconscious follows
corrupting both the intellect and the heart

I will say that each person should pray for guidance
when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe and
should cease their unravelling if they have reason to 
believe their search is displeasing to God

If there is a God he has nothing to fear from truth

I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
couple become married in God's eyes 

I'm waiting for an RC to speak up  
Nobody has so I will

Those with Bibles on hand can give the exact chapter  verse
At the time Jesus told Peter that he was the rock He said
whatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven and 
whatever you don't hold true won't be true in heaven

Therefore with respect to marriage the ceremony has to be
done by an RC priest No big parties required Just the priest
the couple and witnesses Divorce is not allowed But anullments
are granted upon approval by either the bishop or the Pope 
not sure if the Pope delegates this function

 I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
 couple become married in God's eyes  Some say that if the two have
 publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to God and
 are unswervingly committed to one another I realize this is a subjective
 qualifier they are marriedjoined in God's sight
 
 I have discussed this with my girlfriend often  I consider myself married
 though legally I am not  Neither of us have been with other people sexually
 although we have been with each other  We did not have sexual relations
 until we decided to marry eventually  For financial and distance reasons
 we will not be legally married for another year and a half  Until then
 I consider myself married for life in God's eyes  I have faith that we
 have a strong relationship and have had for over  years and will be
 full of joy when we marry in a church  First however we must find a
 church we will be living in a new area when we marry and will need to
 find a new church community
 
 Anyway I feel that if two people commit to marriage before God they are
 married and are bound by that commitment
 
  
 						Rick Szanto


Rick has nailed the problem down pretty well

As I can find no Scripture have I missed it  that details
when you are married I have to make some assumptions based
on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture  

It seems to me that it takes  parties to make a marriage
husbandtobe wifetobe and God  If you promise before
each other and God that you will convenant together to be
married thenyou are IMO

So why do we have the ceremonial part   That seems to be
there for connectedness in the Body of Christ  My brothers
and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some
accountability on both our parts  That's part of the concept
from Hebrews about not forsaking the assembling of yourselves
together as is the custom of some  We need each other because
Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a
self sufficiency that the I don't see in the NT  Does anyone
see the Paul Simon I am a rock I am an island model anywhere
in Christianity Song lyrics show your age   

Further since marriage is a legal matterinstitution in the USA
and many other places and such laws do not specifically go
crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture we ought to
obey them to avoid even the appearance of evil I Thess 

So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage
but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the 
conscience of others because back to the beginningyou are
married when you and your intended promise each other and God
to be in convenant IMO

What ch'all think 

Bobby  akguarjb

In some states the kind of commitment described in Richard Szanto's
posting can create a common law marriage  Indeed his posting itself
might go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists
should the issue ever end up in court  He might want to consult a
lawyer who is familiar with common law marriage in his state  clh

Dean and I write lots and lots about absolute truth and arrogance

vbvrdeeapcwruedu Virgilio Dean B Velasco Jr writes
 I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here which is why I
 deign from commenting much further

I agree that we'll probably never agree and I'm starting to feel 
frustrated and I'm tired of having my conversations with my husband 
dominated by this topic just kidding 

I do have to say though that participating in this discussion has been
a good learning experience for me  My views on this topic have evolved
and clarified through this and I suspect that we may not disagree as 
much as we think 

I admit that I'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity
and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it  I grew up
in EC and went to an EC college  It was definitely the wrong place
for me and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative
Christianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity  I shudder 
when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians 
who didn't adhere to the EC model

I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of 
absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to  I have had some 
very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the 
truth and judging me or others based on their belief that they have 
the answers  Knowing the truth doesn't seem to leave a whole lot of 
room for others' opinions

I can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you don't try to 
use that belief to try to force others to comply with it and you are 
very careful that you don't hurt others with it  Love your neighbor 
seems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes 
that everyone should be living by that truth  Other people have 
convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours 
based on careful searching prayer and their relationship with God  
Don't dismiss them because God didn't lead them to the same conclusions 
as yours

This is not directed personally at you Dean

 I must have missed the postings about Waco David Koresh and the Second
 Coming  How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing unless the
 person claiming to be IT is obviously insane

One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim they are
wrong  I was just reading John  this morning I think that is the
right chapter anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to
check with and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his
impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later
he will be with them  He said something along the lines of I will
be in you and you will be in me  Again I cannot provide the exact
quote or citation  Anyway my understanding of this is that
the Second Coming will not be an outward event  It is an inward
event Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him
If you look for a person you will be deceived

It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would
be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when
he came  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth
A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to
based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over
the world and running it the way it should be  It sounds a lot like
what the Jews were looking for  The First Coming wasn't like that and
I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either

Oh and by the way I don't expect it to happen once  There is no one
Second Coming there are a lot of little ones  Every time Christ
comes into someones heart Christ has come again

The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly
too arrogant or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to
see any discussion grace my computer screen  While it holds PARTICULAR
interest to the AfricanAmerican community everyone has something to gain
from discussing it  As any knowledgable person should know Christianity
has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual emotional  mental
hold slavery placed on the minds souls  hearts of AfricanAmericans 
This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in
slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners  It
wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider but he was also your
GOD to be looked upon with unconditional love  loyalty and to be
worshipped with great pride  But how culturally  biblically accurate are
these icons  Pictures  statues of a Black Jesus have been found in
European countries as that of a Black Madonna  But what about Biblical
physical descriptions of Jesus His hair being compared to that of wool
His feet to that of brass  And think about the area of the world where all
Biblical actions took place  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this
important topic flamers need not reply

Sherlette 

PS  I expect at least THIS type of response  It doesn't matter what
color His skin was His actions  what He did for mankind are what counts
 This is true I am not questioning this  But He walked the earth for 
decades as a HUMAN this part of His existence intrigues me  And as for
saying that it doesn't matter  to a member of a physically emancipated
people who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation believe me  IT
MATTERS

The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified
There has been discussion of this issue in the past  We can't discuss
everything at once so the fact that some specific thing hasn't been
discussed recently shouldn't be taken as a sign of general cowardice
arrogance or apathy  In past discussions no one has been outraged by
suggestions that Jesus could be black and it has been suggested by a
few scholars but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic
As you probably know there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in
art tends to show him as one of the people  Thus you wouldn't be
surprised to find African art showing him as black and oriental art
showing him as oriental  There are good reasons relating to Christian
devotion to think of him in such a way  It's also good now and then
to have that image challenged and to think of Jesus as being a member
of XXX where XXX is the group you least respect  clh

recovery programs involve meeting people's spiritual needs

I responded
 In step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous one of the steps
 involves acknowleding a higher power  AA and other step abuse
 recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective

Dan Johnson clarified
What I was asking is this

Please show me that the most effective substanceabsure recovery
programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs rather than
merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved
by the people AA SRC regulars or snoopy 

You are asking me to provide objective proof for the existence of
God  I never claimed to be able to do this in fact I do not believe
that it is possible to do so  I consider the existence of God to
be a premise or assumption that underlies my philosophy of life
It comes down to a matter of faith   If I weren't a Christian I
would be an agnostic but I have sufficient subjective evidence to
justify and sustain my relationship with God  Again this is a matter
of premises and assumptions  I assume that there is more to life the
universe and everything than materialism ie that spirituality exists
This assumption answers the question about why I have apparent spiritual
needs  I find this assumption consistent with my subsequent observat
ions  I then find that God fills these spiritual needs  But I cannot

I may be wrong but wasn't Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath 

Yes he was  He also played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar before 
he became a Christian  He played in Black Sabbath right after he first 
got saved but then left it

	I've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and
ministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event
About  years or so Is this correct If so why the big time delay
I know all scripture is inspired of God so the time of writing is I suppose
unimportant but I still can't help be curious

The Gospels aren't dated so we can only guess  Luke's prolog is
about the only thing we have from the author describing his process
The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation and had to do
some investigating  There are traditions passed down verbally that
say a few things about the composition of the Gospels  There are
debates about how reliable these traditions are  They certainly don't
have the status of Scripture yet scholars tend to take some of them
seriously  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons and
was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die
One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words
may have been made earlier than the current Gospels  

In the ancient world it was much more common to rely on verbal
transmission of information  I think many people would have preferred
to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him and maybe
even from someone who studied directly under such a person rather
than from a book  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a
period when these people were beginning to die  Scholars generally do
think there was some written material earlier which was probably used
as sources for the existing Gospels

Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business  I have to
confess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods
used  But it's common to think that Mark was written first around 
AD and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the
Century  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the
other

Another issue of importance  Was the crucification the will of God or
a tragic mistake  I believe it was a tragic mistake  God's will can
never be accomplished through the disbelief of man

I finished reading a very good book The Will of God Weatherhead
This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the
will of God

Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts
intentional will circumstancial will and ultimate will  He
Weatherhead also refuted the last statement above by Michael
Parkin above quite nicely

Summarizing despite the failures of humankind God's ultimate will
is never to be defeated  God's intentions may be interfered with
even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind brought down by
circumstance  His ultimate will the reconcilication of all
humankind will never be stopped

Time after time Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of
this process at work  His points paraphrased were  God's
intentional will was for Jesus the Christ to live out a full life
and perform the work of the Living God   The failures sins and
deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son  
Despite the circumstance God's ultimate will was revealed in the
Cross as Jesus willingly not my will Lord but yours died for
the redemption of all humankind  The Cross was utterly triumphant
overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances

this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth  He
desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah  If
the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this
cup pass from him  Was this out of weakness  NEVER  Many men and
women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes
Is Jesus less than these  No he is not  He knew the crucification
was NOT the will of GOD 

It was not the intentional will of God  It was the circumstancial
will thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will


 God's will was that the Jewish people accept
Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on
the earth with Jesus as it's head 

Right intentional will

Just like the Jewish people
expected If this had happened  years ago can you imagine what
kind of world we would live in today  It would be a very different
world  And that is eactly what GOD wanted  Men and women of that age
could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on
the earth  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would
have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to
live with GOD  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to
wait for Christ's return  But when he returns will he be recognized
and will he find faith on this earth  Isn't it about time for his
return  It's been almost  years

We know neither the time nor the place  He will return as a thief in the night

Peace

Rob

Hi everyone 
	   I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem  I know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying' You fools
do you still think that just believing is enough'

some deleted

Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do
as taught in Romans but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spatout'

Can anyone help me this really bothers me

Dear Will

I've never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok
I had a few thoughts

Faith on its own if not accompanied by action is dead  James 

Faith is both belief and action
If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming am I really a
swimmer and will people believe that I am
Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God am I really a
Christian My faith is demonstrated by my action The fact that we talk to
God proves we have faith Satan believes in God but does not follow Him

In a similar vein I have recently been challenged by John
v says We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands
I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have
come to know Him then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and
we cannot help but obey what He says
I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing
us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically
produced in our lives

Hope this helps

 excellent question timothy i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory  
as we can not understand the mind of god but to attempt to answer you  
clearly GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he  
intends to judge mankind the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus  
Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to  
serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god  
the bible calls this sin for those who die before the end of the worldhave  
already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche
  God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world however  
there is no plus and minus system for GOD he has declared that he can not  
tolerate spiritual imperfection thus he can only based your worthiness to  
live with him on the wrong in your life 
  Good people yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD The  
Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's  
penalty the proscribed punishment for sin is death just as the proscribed  
punishment for robbery is time in jail God then cannot ask for anything but  
punishement for those sins He does not want to condem the Bible says in John  
 that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  
through him it might be saved when i realize that i have sinned and i do  
with painful regularity i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin  
against me i have that right and privlige only because of Christ as for Jews  
they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come and  
dis come in Jesus of Nazereth Muslims i fear have been given a lie from the  
fater of lies Satan They need Christ as do us all
  for those who don't have that right in the view of the bible they stand  
olone in their defense are you going to hell i can not answer that for you  
i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  
Hell that step is much more rewarding

To recapitulate a bit

 The essence of marriage is two people's commitment to each other

 If two people claim to be married in their hearts but are not
  willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state that's
  prima facie evidence that the commitment isn't really there

 There are obvious situations in which Christian marriage is possible
  without a civil or church wedding if you're stranded on a desert
  island or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason
  eg laws against interracial marriage

 The legal concept of commonlaw marriage is meant to ensure that
  the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the
  usual ceremony and recordkeeping

 Pastorally I'm concerned that people should not use being married
  in God's eyes as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding
  One has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed
  
 But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony
  without making a genuine commitment and therefore are not married
  in God's eyes  Right

  Athens Georgia  USA     amateur radio NTMI       

I think the last statement is dangerous  I believe as long as
someone has formally undertaken the responsibility of marriage they
have a moral obligation even if their intention was not right  Other
people are involved in the marriage covenant  If they believed in
good faith that a marriage occurred then I think there are
obligations created to them  Of course there are situations where
intent can cause a marriage not to exist  The classic example is when
it's done as part of a play  But these are exceptions and should be
clear to all parties  clh

 Thank you for this info  What respect I had for the man now

      say how wise or loving this man was

I have a hard time understanding this attitude

If the gospels are the least bit accurate then there can be little
doubt that Jesus belived hell was a reality

As a teacher what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people
in your audience were headed there  To warn them  It would however 
be rather cruel andor sadistic to believe that such a place exists 
and then remain quiet about it  

The only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be
justified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell and spoke
about it anyway just to scare people Unless you would accuse Jesus
of this I would encourage you to reconsider what a loving response 
is when you perceive someone to be in danger

We look for the resurrection of the dead and the
life of the world to come   NiceneConstantinopolitan Creed

I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the
resurrection of the soul but I guess resurrection does strictly mean
the raising of the physical body  I have some questions on this point

The next time you go to church you can check the better creed that is
the Apostles' Creed  It says the resurrection of the body  Should
have learned that on the first go around  But what's a body without 
a little bit a'soul 

  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was 
pretty much immediate and that there are people burning in hell right
now Where will my soul 
which by the way I don't believe in exist until that time

At the risk of offending everybody I will interject the th century
point of view  Christ descended immediately into the bosom of Abraham
to set captives captive  He preached to the saved for three days before
drawing them with Him back to this earth  I'm no expert on this part
but Matthew  says about the death of Jesus tombs were opened
and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised  And
coming forth from the tombs after his resurrection they entered the
holy city and appeared to many  NAB  Regarding the hell of the
damned of which you speak Christ did not see it Ps  Acts 
although it saw Him cf Is   

Concerning the abodes of the dead I don't want to subject my brethren
to further anguish so I will direct you to contact me through email
if you are genuinely concerned 

  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms 
that my body now is made of or will it be built from scratch 

Your new body might be something like Adam's before his fateful encounter
with the Just One Acts  CR trans Vulgate filled with infused
knowledge absent of concupiscence and immortal  It would probably be
a little glorified too

  Since I will have a physical body I assume it will need a physical
place to exist in  where is this hell  In the center of the earth
Do you think we could find it if we dig

I wouldn't recommend it  It's really hot down at the center of the earth
You know the normal geothermal gradient and all that

In article Aprathosrutgersedu aafreenetcarletonca Mark Baker writes

 I am asking you to believe in things not visible I don't know if this is 
believeing blindly or not I'm not sure how blindness comes into it I do  not
deny reason indeed I insist upon it but reason only draws conclusions  from
evidence If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on  the
evidence of the five physical senses then you cut reason off from any 
possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere beyond the 
rather provocative if inconclusive conclusion that the physical sphere  is
not self explanatory 

So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences since
this is the only other source of information left to us
How can you then convince somebody that your feelings and experiences
are the correct ones then if you can't show somebody visible and
measurable effects  If my experiences say that there exists no god
and yours says there does where does that leave us  Since we are only
going on experiences then both of us are correct within our own personal
realities

Furthermore the trouble with feelings and experiences is that they
can lead you astray as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates  I
am sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but
I think that you and I will agree that they were being misled

Finally how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical
sphere is not selfexplanatory when you only rely on the five senses

 Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence 
 which they call faith and which is a gift of God That is this evidence
 is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself The 
 evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists Reasoning
 on the evidence of the senses won't help either But Christians do reason
 of the evidence of faith and do claim that this evidence is wholly
 consistent with the evidence of the other senses and indeed that the
 evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself
 to us

You must be using a definition of evidence that I am not familiar with
To me evidence is something you can show others unambiguously that
what you are saying is true

However I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith
It is not something you can share around  others must experience it
independantly  Unfortunately as I have explained above this puts
belief down to a matter of experience  My impression is that Christians
do not have the monopoly on reason evidence and faith as far as any of
these things can go

 In a previous article phsdvaxcccmonasheduau  says
 
You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything  However if
we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone  And since
we can only use faith why is one picture of God eg Hinduism any less
valid than another eg Christianity

 Faith as I have said is not opposed to reason it is simply a new source 
 of evidence on which reason may operate It is clear that human beings
 have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses and
 similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by
 faith Religious believers in general and Christians in particular use
 reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding
 of the evidence provided by faith Science claims with good reason to be
 the most valid system for explaining the physical universe and Christianity
 claims also with good reason to be the most valid system possessed of the
 best evidence for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man

At the risk of repeating my argument  As I have explained previously 
the trouble is that Moslems Buddhists Jews etc will ALL say that THEY
claim with good reason to be a valid system possessed of the best
evidence for explaining Gods revelations to man for Buddhists it
should read for explaining the nonexistence of God  So not only
must you prove your own case you have to disprove theirs

altmessianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief
of their own faiths  and with their own good reasons

 If you doubt that Christians use reason read this newsgroup for a while
 and you will see rational debate aplenty

I know that ALL people can use reason  I never claimed that they don't
I just wish to make sure that their arguments are wellfounded  It goes
without saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct
me  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the 
nonessential and contradictory bits we should hopefully have made
some progress towards the truth

   For God so loved the world that He gave His only son that

   I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular
   ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category
   that we humans like to drop people into But He does REQUIRE
   that we believe and trust Him In Hebrews it says that God spoke
   of old by the prophets the old testament but in these last days
   he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ And we learn of
   Him through the pages of the New Testament The Bible tells us
   what we need to believe For those who have never heard I leave
   them in God's capable care He will make himself known as he

One of the Laws of Nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate 
at least to this layman's mind there must be a causal event  No
reasonable alternative exists

The bigbang model supposes a temporal singularity at the point of
origin There was no time for a prior cause to occur in If you
want to invent fables for the surrounding context fine but one fable
is only as good as any other Why should I prefer to believe in a God that
just exists as opposed to a singularity that just happened or 
giant puce subspace iguanas that fling universes off their tongues
like gobs of spit

As far as I can tell the very laws of nature demand a why  That isn't
true of something outside of nature ie supernatural

I believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes
but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining 
reproducing life ever  I've never been much of a prophet though I
can't even picture New York in my mind    I don't believe any
technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite
having all of the parts available Just my opinion

Just your opinion and unfortunately wrong Self assembling molecules
have already been produced entirely from inert matter and have
spontaneously mutated into a more rapidly assembling form on exposure
to ultraviolet light Both abiogenesis and the beginnings of evolution
TODAY saw this in Nature early last year

Biological vitalism is dead and has been dead for many many years
Give it up Life is not a 'spark' Life is the selforganization
of systems poised between chaos and order

Until the King returns

Jason

Your King baldly and repeatedly stated he would be back within the lifetime
of some then present and alive Soon soon he said over and over  as
have many would be messiahs

I should have watched this more closely  We had a discussion about
the first cause etc not long ago  I'm not up for a replay
There was also a detailed discussion of the point Max brings up
here about the initial singularity  The geometry near the big bang
is very interesting  Time turns into space so there is no before

From article Aprathosrutgersedu by ruthlesspanixcom Ruth Ditucci
 Coming from a long line of hot tempered people I know temper when I see
 it  One of the tell tale signsfruits that give nonchristians away  is
 when their net replies are acrid angry and sarcastic  

I do hope that you are not suggesting that merely because a person
replies in an acrid angry and sarcastic manner that this
demonstrates their 'nonchristianity'  The simple fact is that there
is not a Christian on the face of the planet that I know of that is
perfect  I have been known at times to have a fit of temper or a
sulk but this does not make me any the less a Christian

One of the points of being a Christian as I perceive it is to become
MORE LIKE Christ  This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOT
already like Christ  Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper  I
do  Jesus was perfect  I'm not

 We in the net village do have a laugh or two when professed born again
 christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won to
 christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were
 spiritually hungry  Instead of answering questions with sweetness and
 sincerity these chrisitan netwarriors flame the queries 

You must understand that this is because Christians often forget to
treat others as our rolemodel  Christ  would  This is because we are
human and falible  I for one do not pretend to be infalible and I
hope that my fellowmen will bear with me when I make mistakes  This
surely is not too much to ask when I make every effort to bear with
them


 You don't need any enemies  You already do yourselves the greatest harm

And don't we know it

 Again I say foolish foolish foolish

Again I say we are ALL human

To my brethren this  

Ms Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed the
warning in her article  We oftimes discredit ourselves and our
Saviour in the way that we treat others  Strive towards the goal set
us by our Lord but in the meantime remember 

     There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ

When you blow it  go easy on yourself  Forgive yourself as your
Father in heaven forgives you  And remember  and this is something I
firmly beieve and cling to  one day we shall see Him face to face
and in that day we shall finally be perfected  

I look forward to seeing you there

 Jeff Fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for Black Sabbath
 He was never ever a musician in the band  He was in St Louis several
 months back  The poster I saw at the Christian bookstore I frequent
 really turned me off  It was addressed to all Homosexuals prostitutes
 drug addicts alcoholics and headbangers or something like that
 
 Well if I showed up with my long hair and black leather jacket I
 would have felt a little prejudged 

I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didn't find him judgemental  I think
that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate but I think they
were trying to say that headbangers would like the program  But I would
NOT put headbangers in the same class as alcholics etc  it is
condescending  And I believe that Jeff was wearing black when I saw him

By the way Fenholt played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar

Personally I'm a headbanger at times too but I have a hard time with what
most of the secular metal groups promote  Free sex and drugs my opinion
that many promote these aren't my thing  I HAVE found several good
Christian metal groups that I like

Well I'll email also but this may apply to other people so
I'll post also

I've been working at this company for eight years in various
engineering jobs  I'm female  Yesterday I counted and realized that
on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this
company

I dreaded coming back to work today  What if my boss comes in to ask
me some kind of question

Your boss should be the person bring these problems to  If heshe
does not seem to take any action keep going up higher and higher
Sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated and it can be an
enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that
they are trying to do something about it  If you feel you can not
discuss this with your boss perhaps your company has a personnel
department that can work for you while preserving your privacy  Most
companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety
does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs

It is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not  It is
not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee
problemsstrife even after eight years it's a miracle if they do
notice  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of
higher ups  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the
entire problem there may be a state agency willing to fight with
you  check with a lawyer a women's resource center etc to find out

You may also want to discuss this with your paster priest husband
etc  That is someone you know will not be judgemental and that is
supportive comforting etc  This will bring a lot of healing

So I returned at  only to find that ever single
person had already left for lunch  They left at  or so  No one
could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my
number was posted

This happens to a lot of people  Honest  I believe it may seem
to be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are
going through  People in offices tend to be more insensitive while
working than they normally are maybe it's the hustle or stress or
I've had this happen to me a lot often because they didn't realize
my car was broken etc  Then they will come back and wonder why I
didn't want to go this would tend to make me stop being angry at
being ignored and make me laugh  Once we went off without our
boss who was paying for the lunch 

For this
reason I hope good Mr Moderator allows me this latest indulgence

Well if you can't turn to the computer for support what would
we do  signs of the computer age 

In closing please don't let the hateful actions of a single person
harm you  They are doing it because they are still the playground
bully and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause  And you should not
accept the opinions of an imbecile that you are worthless  much
wiser people hold you in great esteem

I have stated before that I do not consider myself an atheist but 
                           
So you believe in the existance of One creator I assume


definitely do not believe in the christian god  The recent discussion
about atheists and hell combined with a post to another group to the
effect of 'you will all go to hell' has me interested in the consensus 
as to how a god might judge men  As a catholic I was told that a jew
buddhist etc might go to heaven but obviously some people do not
believe this  Even more see atheists and pagans I assume I would be 
lumped into this category to be hellbound  I know you believe only
god can judge and I do not ask you to just for your opinions

Ok god has the disclaimer reserves the right to judge individual
cases  If we believe him to be loving then we also believe him to be
able to serve justice to all  Don't worry if a Jew or athiest is
going to heaven or hell for that is god to judge although truly
if you were concerned you could only worry abput those who refuse to
believesatisfy gods decrees as much as keeping yourself straight
If you see something going on that is wrong discuss it and explore it
before making summary judgement  People have enough free will to choose
for themselves so don't force choices on them just inform them
of what they're choices are  God will take care of the rest in his justice

 The next Sunday the sermon was about Joshua  where the Israelites
 take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there  except
 for Rahab who had sheltered the spies  With those reports about
 Bosnia in my mind I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that
 the massacre the one in Joshua was right  But what really bothered
 me was that if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously I
 shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of ethnic cleansing in
 Bosnia  Certainly my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims
 Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians
 who under Turkish rule converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing
 God's work

Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic
cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very
act of killing  Does it reflect the attitude of God who sends rain to
both the just and the unjust  If not then Christians should be
uncomfortable with it  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to
follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known 
Doctrinal or political correctness is not the standard so I don't see
why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors
converted from Christianity to Islam  It seems to me that as a
Christian you should be troubled by the ethnic cleansing

	Why do we follow God so blindly  Have you ever asked a
physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog
The answer is quite simplethe dog can see and the blind person
cannot

	Of course you may ask if I cannot trust my own senses
how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or
a lie  That is why we need faith to be saved  We must force
ourselves to believe that God knows the truth and loves us
enough to share it with us even when it defies what we think
we know  Why would He have created us if He did not love us 
enough to help us through this world


Seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and
reality on your own you wouldn't need to rely on doctrines that
need to be updated  My experience of Christianity  years is
that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little
or no direct experience of spiritual matters and that most of
these questions can be answered by simple introspection  Most
people suspect that they cannot trust their senses but few take
the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves  Not to
get too esoteric but it seems that most religions Christianity
included are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand
this

stuff deleted

	As for you no one can convert you  You must
choose to follow God of your own will if you are ever to
follow Him  All we as Christians wish to do is share with
you the love we have received from God  If you reject that
we have to accept your decision although we always keep
the offer open to you  If you really want to find out
why we believe what we believe I can only suggest you try
praying for faith reading the Bible and asking Christians
about their experiences personally

And what if the original poster Pixie is never converted
Does it make sense that she or I or the majority of humanity
for that matter would go to hell for eternity as many 
Christians believe  It makes more sense to me that rather
than be converted to a centuriesold doctrine that holds no
life for her that she simply continue to decide for herself
what is best  



You may be right about Christians relying on clergy but I have some
reason to hope you're not  Protestants emphasize conversion
experience of the Holy Spirit and use of the Bible  This is intended
to make sure that Christians have religious experience of their own
and that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy and
other Christians  I can't speak for Catholics and Orthodox but I
believe they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeat
what they are told  I admit that this isn't always successful  we
certainly see young people join our church because at that age parents
expect it  But most of our members do seem quite able and willing to
make judgements for themselves and have a commitment that comes out
of their own experience  Unfortunately it's the nature of Usenet
that doctrinal disagreements get emphasized so it looks like we spend
most of our time dealing with doctrine  That's certainly not my
experience of the way Christians really live  clh

OFM responds to a query about reference works

   Aside from a commentary you might also want to consider an
   introduction  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible
   courses  They give historical background discussion of literary
   styles etc  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further
   reading  I typically recommend Kee Froehlich and Young's NT
   introduction

Two other Intros to consider

The Introduction by Kummel is a translation of a strandard NT text
The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense but
the book contains a wealth of information

Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good  It's somewhat more
modern than Kummel's but not quite so densely packed  Also the
authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order
of composition this gives a very useful perspective on the
development of the NT

    There are also some good onevolume commentaries   Probably the
   best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary

A slight dissent I think the Harper's is OK but not great  One
particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on
bibliographic material  My feeling is that it is OK for quick
lookups but not real useful for study in depth eg I keep a copy
in my office at work

    I think there may be a couple of books with this title

So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title
James L Mays general editor Harper and ROw  although I think
I recall a older series under the name Harper Commentaries  Also
there's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary most of my comments on
the HC also apply to the HBD

My favorite onevolume commentary is the New Jerome Biblical
Commentary  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased
towards the NT  The reader can decide for her or himself whether
these are pluses or minuses  In any case the scholarship is by and
large excellent

NOTE The NJBC is a completely reworked updated version of the
Jerome Biblical Commentary copies of which can still be found on
sale

 I have heard an interesting notion that sin can block our prayers to God
 ie God will not hear our prayers if we have not confessed our sins Now I am
 totally supportive of confessing our sins before God but I simply do not
 believe God will shut us out just because we did not confess This is kind of
 like the idea that suffering is caused by sin which as any Job reader will
 realize is too simpilistic
rest deleted

Can the Father possibly not hear the words of His children
Of course He hears all your prayers
Whether you are a sinner or a saint no questions
The real question you should be asking is Does sin block OUR hearing His
answer And the answer to that question is a resounding YES
To paraphrase the gospel Many are called but few choose to listen
and so it is with prayer 


In Christ

 Very good and reasonable statements on authority deleted
 
 The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities This is a
 reasonable assertion in itself but it leads to a practical difficulty
 If you reject all authority out of hand you reject all possibility of
 every receiving information Thus the atheist position can never possibly
 change It is nonfalsifiable and therefore unscintific 

This is not true  The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the
existence of God  As much as some people accept their Church their priests
or straight from their own scriptures as the proof this does not 
satisfy atheists

Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities  If they were as dogmatic as
you claim they are they would be trying to prove     every time they
got up  What they dispute is that Churches priests scriptures etc
represent true authorities and know the TRUTH

 To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence is to deny
 God's existence since neither science nor reason can in their very
 nature prove anything

Are you asking us to believe blindly  You are trying to deny that part of
us that makes us ask the question Does God exist ie selfawareness and
reason  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant
as the other animals on this earth  Does God want us to be like that

You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything  However if
we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone  And since
we can only use faith why is one picture of God eg Hinduism any less
valid than another eg Christianity

Any former atheists converted by argument
This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are
any such cases  I doubt it  In the medieval period esp thcent
when Aquinas flourished argument was a useful tool because everyone
knew the rules  Today when you can't count on people knowing even
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric a good argument is
often indistinguishable from a poor one
 
 The last sentence is ironic since so many readers of
 socreligionchristian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as
 Josh McDowell and CS Lewis

I haven't followed whatever discussion there may have been on these
people but I feel that C S Lewis is an excellent apologist and I
see no reason for embarrassment  If you think that errors and flawed
arguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker you must dismiss
nearly every thinker from Descartes to Kant any philosophy course
will introduce you to their weaknesses  
 
  The above also expresses a rather odd sense
 of history What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day who were
 mostly illiterate knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people
 today If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the
 cream of the crop so to speak could read and write If everyone in
 the medieval period knew the rules it was a matter of uncritically
 accepting what they were told

I said nothing about the masses  However comparing the masses in
our day and in Aquinas' day really is odd  Read Ortega y Gasset on
this

I'm talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night and
winning on logic and evidence only to discover your opponent to be
unaware even intuitively of things like entailment let alone
pragmatics  I am assuming that both parties are college graduates
or better  Myself I don't bother any more

 Hi

 I am new to this newsgroup and also fairly new to christianity
  I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and
 quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true This I am trying
 to rectify by reading the Bible of course but it would be helpful
 to also read a good interpretationcommentary on the Bible or other
 relevant aspects of the Christian faith One of my questions I would
 like to ask is  Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological
 works intended for a lay person

I'd recommend McDowell's Evidence that Demands a Verdict books  I
think and  Manfred Brauch's Hard Sayings of Paul  He also may have
done Hard Sayings of Jesus  My focus would be for a new Christian to
struggle with his faith and be encouraged by the historical evidence
especially one who comes from a background which emphasizes knowable faith

Finally
There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ except in our spirits
communion with his and the Father's  It is a matter of FAITH belief
without logical proof  Incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for
rational western man myself included
I hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a 
rejection of the resurrection's occurance  I beleive but I wanted to point 
out the weakness of logical proofs

Terms are being used in a loaded way here

Logical proof is an extremely messy thing to apply to real
life If you think otherwise try to construct a proof that
yesterday happened Obviously it did anyone old enough to be
reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened
But proof A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere
You need axioms to talk about logical proof You can say that
you remember yesterday and that you take as axiom that anything
you clearly remember happened I could counterclaim that you
hallucinated the whole thing

To talk about proofs of historical events you have to relax the
terms a bit You can show evidences not proofs Evidences of the
resurrected Jesus exist Proofs do not

I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is
ever disproved I also think that this will not happen as
the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things
go It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take
the resurrection on faith There are reasons to believe it
that appeal to the mind too

 I have another question I would like to ask I am not yet affiliated
 with any one congregation Aside from matters of taste what criteria
 should one use in choosing a church I don't really know the difference
 between the various Protestant denominations
 
Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they
think of choosing a car or a country club What I mean is that our 
culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather
than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer 
an initial and primary part of the decision process People tend to
treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to
their liking off they go to another one

I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different 
perspective on the church choosing process It seems to me from Cor 
that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all
but that he places us in the body as he wants us So I think a better
question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where
God is trying to place me

If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ the church they
go to is a logical first choice You have been born into the family of
God People should hop around from church to church as often as they
hop from natural family to family

If you met the Lord on your own so to speak there may not be an 
easily identifiable church to try for starters Here you are more
like an orphan Prayerfully go and leave yourself on a few doorsteps
and see if anyplace feels like home 

I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you
have difficulty fitting in with the people but on the other hand
there are no perfect churches If you have an attitude of looking
for problems you will both find them and make them On the other hand
if you have an attitude of love and committment you will spread that
wherever you go 

In general I think that God will try to place you in a church that
talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is
expanding on that base

I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be 
an innappropriate emphasis on Hell  God deserves our love and worship 
because of who He is  I do not like the idea of frightening people into 
accepting Christ  

And yet Jayne  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus
himself spoke on Hell figures in a large  of the time certainly more than
heaven itself  Paul as we learn in I Thess taught new believers and new
churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation  Rev
chapter  is very specific and cannot be allegorized  I think the word
throne is used  times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the
assignment of the severity of judgement for in John  we read that they are
already judged  Rom  speaks that every mouth will be shut  There is no
recourse excuse or defense

I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with 
putting into words and explaining that love  Preaching the Gospel 
without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a 
clanging cymbal

Yes I agree with you  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to
extremes before stopping at moderation  I think we have seen the extreme of
the hell fire  brimstone preacher but also we have seen the other extreme
where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones
sensibilities

I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries but I remember him telling a
story  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the
point of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell  He believed
everybody was going to heaven  It was at this point that the man was asked to
pray to God that He would send his children to hell  Of course the man
wouldn't do it  But the point was made  Many people say they don't believe in
hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't
exist  If this man had he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't
exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered  And
yet they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there

I'd use a different illustration however  I have to include myself in it 
When I watch say a Basketball go Bulls game and I see a blatant foul that
isn't called oi vey  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call 
It's unfair  And just so in life righteousness demands payment  As the
surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away so God cuts off that which
is still of the old creation  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness
which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life
then broad is the way to distruction


Here's a question  How many of you are Christians because you are 
afraid of going to Hell  How many are responding to God's love

I think I would fall in there somewhere  Actually it was both  After all
repentance isn't only a turning towards but also a turning away from
No again if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we
should do it also  In love of course but in truth most assuredly  

I have thought about writing something on this topic but not now and here  I
would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its
eternality

 God is Light  Yes He is love but His love has the boundary of Holiness
 Dignity of Man  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature
   If responsible then he is also accountable
 The awfulness of sin  Today we have a poor poor concept of sin  God
 Christ  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to
   the whosoever will

With Frank's permission I have added some information here and in
one case changed the order of his contributions in order to clarify
the historical relationship of the views  My comments are based
primarily on William Rusch's historical summary in The Trinitarian
Controversy Fortress  I'm going to save this as an FAQ  clh

MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY
 
SECOND CENTURY

The writers of the nd Cent are important because they set up much
of the context for the later discussions  Justin Martyr Aristides
Athenagoras Tatian and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the
Apologists  Their theology has often been described as Logos
theology  Based strongly on wording in John they took more or less
a twophase approach  Through eternity the Logos was with the
Father as his mind or thought  This immanent Word became
expressed as God revealed himself in history ultimately in Jesus
Thus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in
history though the Logos had been present in God from eternity
Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the
final orthodox position but in a form which is less sophisticated
because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with
the eternal plurality in the Godhead

Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists  However he
was uncomfortable with the twostage approach  He still viewed God as
one personage with distinctions that did not become fully visible
except through his process of selfrevelation the economy  The
distinctions are present in his essential nature  Irenaeus emphasized
the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists  Irenaeus' views should
probably be called economic trinitarianism though that term is
normally used as below to refer to later developments


THIRD CENTURY

clh

Dynamic Monarchianism
 
Source Theodotus
Adherents Paul of Samosota Artemon Socinus Modern Unitarians
Perception of God's Essence The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature
and oneness of person The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are
consubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes
The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus but he was not God in the strict
sense of the word
Perception of God's Subsistence The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable
impossibility since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible The
'diversity' of God is apparent and not real since the Christ event and the
work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God not to
a hypostatic union
Asignation of DeityEternality
 Father Unique originator of the universe He is eternal selfexistent and
without beginning or end
 Son A virtuous but finite man in whose life God was dynamically present in
a unique way Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified
 Holy Spirit An impersonal attribute of the Godhead No deity or eternality
is ascribed to the Holy Spirit
Criticisms Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation
concerning the Trinity Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the
Holy Spirit thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical
doctrine of salvation
In summary this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism
at all  God is an undifferentiated one  Son and Holy Spirit are seen
as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the
Church  clh

 
Modalistic Monarchianism
 
Source Praxeas
Adherents Noatus Sabellius Swedenborg Scleiermacher United Pentecostals
Jesus Only
Perception of God's Essence The unity of God is ultrasimplex He is
qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person  This
essence may be designated interchangeably as Father Son and Holy Spirit
They are different names for but identical with the unified simplex God The
three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself
Perception of God's Subsistence The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous
and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting
of himself The paradox of a subsisting three in oneness is refuted by
recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different
names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama
Asignation of DeityEternality
 Father Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of
the only unique and unitary God
 Son Full deityeternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another
mode of the one God and identical with his essence he is the same God
manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role incarnation
 Holy Spirit Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the
one God in temporal sequence manifested himself pursuant to the role of
regeneration and sanctification
Criticisms Depersonalizes the Godhead To compensate for its Trinitarian
deficiencies this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical Its
concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such
simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism
Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy  There are
actually two slightly different groups included Noetus and his
followers and Sabellius  Noetus was apparently more extreme
Sabellius followed him and attempted to use some features of economic
Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view  Unfortunately
information about Sabellius comes from a century later and there
seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra clh
 
I've moved the following description to be with the other
thirdcentury views  It originally appeared near the end  clh

Economic Trinitarianism
 
Source Hippolytus Tertullian
Adherents Various neoeconomic Trinitarians
Perception of God's Essence The Godhead is characterized by triunity Father
Son and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical
indivisible substance The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially
comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption
Perception of God's Subsistence Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated
by means of such terms as distinction and distribution dispelling
effectively the notion of separateness or division
Asignation of DeityEternality
The equal deity of Father Son and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in
observation of the simultaneous relationaloperational features of the
Godhead Coeternality at times does not intelligibly surface in this
ambiguous view but it seems to be a logical implication
Criticisms Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the
relational aspect of the Trinity
Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus as
mentioned above  As with them the threeness is visible primarily in
the various ways that God revealed himself in history  However they
did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow
present in the Godhead from the beginning  Tertullian talks of
the Father Son and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in
substance  Many people regard this view as being essentially
orthodox but with less developed philosophical categories  clh

Origen developing further an approach started by Clement attempted
to apply neoPlatonism to Christian thought  He set many of the terms
of the coming battle  In Platonic fashion he sees the Son as a
mediator mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality
of creating beings  The Son is generated but he is eternally
generated  That is the relationship between Father and Son is
eternal  It cannot be said that there was once when he was not a
phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries  Having the Son
is intrinsic to his concept of God  The Father and Son are described
as separate hypostases though this may not have quite the meaning
of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts  The union is
one of love and action but there is some reason to think that he may
have used the term homoousios of the same substance  The Holy
Spirit is also an active personal substance originated by the Father
through the Son  Origen's intent is trinitarian not tritheistic but
he pushes things in the direction of separateness


FOURTH CENTURY

clh

Subordinationism  often called Arianism clh
 
Source Arius
Major Adherents Modern Jehovah's Witnesses and several other lesser known
cults
Perception of God's Essence The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly
identifiable with the Father only The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet
entities who do not share the divine essence
Perception of God's Subsistence The unipersonal essence of God precludes the
concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead Threeness in oneness is self
contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God
Asignation of DeityEternality
 Father The only one unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning
 Son A created being and therefore not eternal Though he is to be venerated
he is not of the divine essence
 Holy Spirit A nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the Father He is viewed
as an influence an expression of God  Deity is not ascribed to him
Criticisms It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting
the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit Its hierarchial concept likewise
asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father Christ
and the Holy Spirit This results in a totally confused soteriology
Note also that in most versions of this view the Son is not fully
human either  He is supernatural and sinless  That distinguishes this
view from adoptionism  clh
 
Orthodox Trinitarianism
 
Source Athanasius
Adherents Basil Gregory of Nyssa Gregory of Nazianzus Augustine Thomas
Aquinas Luther Calvin Contemporary orthodox Christianity
Perception of God's Essence God's being is perfectly unified and simplex of
one essence  This essence of deity is held in common by Father Son and Holy
Spirit The three persons are consubstantial coinherent coequal and co
eternal
Perception of God's Subsistence The divine subsistence is said to occur in
three modes of being or hypostases As such the Godhead exists undivided in
divided persons This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation
in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead
Asignation of DeityEternality
In its final distillation this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father Son
and Holy Spirit as coequal and coeternal in the Godhead with regard to both
the divine essence and function
Criticisms The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in
human language and thought itself the impossibility of totally describing the
ineffable mystery of three in oneness
At least in the th Cent there were several different approaches all
of which fit the description here and all regarded as orthodox but which
are somewhat different in detail  Nicea was originally held to respond
to Arius  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit
too far to the point of making the Son a separate entity  In general
the East tended to take an approach based on Origen's and it was hard
to get acceptance of Nicea in the East  Its final acceptance was
based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians Gregory of Nyssa and
Gregory of Nazianzus among others  While starting with three
they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one
must think of them as being a single God  This allowed the Council
of Constantinople in  to get wide agreement on the idea of
three hypostatese and one ousia  clh

Desiree Bradley DesireeBradleymindlinkbcca asked us whether we
should think of the Serbs as doing God's work in Bosnia  I've
refrained from posting in hope that someone who is more familiar with
the OT than I would answer  But at this point I feel I have to say
something

Many things about this posting bother me  I know of not the slightest
suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the
Gospel and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death
of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel  Christ died to break
down these distinctions  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek there
is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female  If
Moslems do not know him we may preach to them but we don't kill
them  Furthermore the attack is between states not religions
There are Christians being attacked as well  One of the towns under
attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are
living together peacefully

The precedents being suggested are from the OT  There are in fact two
different things being alluded to  The first is from the entry into
Canaan  For that to be a parallel we would need for God to have
promised this land through a prophet  And we would need the war to be
a holy war  There were tight constraints on behavior in those
attacks  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be
defeated  Rape would not have been tolerated  While the accounts in
Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed note that it was
possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites and that once
that was done  even when deception was involved  they were
expected to honor it  In contrast there have been many violations of
agreement in this incident I see no evidence that God has granted
Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land and if he had their behavior
would have disqualified this from being a holy war

The other OT parallel is from later when Israel was defeated by
Assyria and Babylonia  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel
for her sins  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a
judgement on the Bosnians for their sins  This sounds like a replay
of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because
illness is God's judgement  Yes even bad things may be used by God
for good  That includes actions of bad people  But that doesn't
justify them  If you read the prophets you find them very clear that
in attacking Israel the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as
unintentional agents of God  Their intent was to attack God's
people and they would be judged for it  The fact that they were
actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action
Furthermore we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are
judgements from God  God explicitly interpreted that case through
his prophets  As far as I know he did not send any prophets to
Bosnia  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting
I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad  But that
doesn't justify it and it won't save the people who are doing it from
judgement

I am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue
because of current tensions between the West and Moslemoriented
nations  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that
Christians think it's OK to kill Moslems  The implications for the
midEast and even relations with American Moslems could be quite
serious

 	   I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem  I know
 that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet
 hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying' You fools
 do you still think that just believing is enough'

Stuff deleted
 
 Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do
 as taught in Romans but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
 in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spatout'
 
 Can anyone help me this really bothers me


Will there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in
srcbs
I will make the case here though and try to help you out

 For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it
is the gift of God
 Not of works lest any man should boast
Ephesians 

Yes it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved  We are not
saved by what we do  However

 If ye love me keep my commandments
John 

Keeping Christ's commandments is a work per se and a demonstration of
our love for him  Also

 He spake also this parable A certain man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none
 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard Behold these three years
I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why
cumbereth it the ground
 And he answering said unto him Lord let it alone this year also till I
shall dig about it and dung it
 And if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it
down
Luke 

Again

 Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye
should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that
whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it you
John 

It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit 
What is that fruit  Well Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being
love joy peace patience etc  All of these are things that are manifest
in the actions that we carry out

If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ but does not do the things
Christ commanded I dare say that they really don't have any faith 
Asking which is more important faith or works is like asking which blade
on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your
pants is more important

Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith  To have faith
true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands  The parable
above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit  Christs
commands are actions and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit
then we shall be uprooted just like the tree 

It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it  Actions
prove our faith and show the genuineness of it  I can sit and talk for
days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a
building and not hit the ground  In other words I can sit and tell you
all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly  I really don't have
that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the
test  Words and talk mean nothing

I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will but
this should be sufficient

Hope it helped

 I must have missed the postings about Waco David Koresh and the Second
 Coming  How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing unless the
 person claiming to be IT is obviously insane

First by his fruits  The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven
on the earth  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of
original sin fallen nature and then provide a means to cut the
connection to that original sin  He also wants to create world peace
based on Godism  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation
of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God
the fall of man the purpose of creation and God's providence of
restoration  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all
the World's religions

Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds so they may
miss him when he returns Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 
years ago  They are still waiting for his first coming  The Jewish
people of that age expected Elijah to come first  Jesus said that
John the Baptist was Elijah But John the Baptist denied that he was
Elijah  How did this reflect on Jesus  Later in prison John even
questioned who Jesus was is he the one who is to come or do we look
for another see book of Matthew

 
 I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ  How could
 somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming  Koresh did promise that
 he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio
 broadcast  He didn't  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people

David Koresh didn't even come close  The problem is that people like
this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real
Messiah when he does show up

 
 And from my meagre knowledge of the Bible it seems that Christians have
 been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting
 somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah
 
 So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be
 early to recognize the Second Coming while at the same time not wanting to
 be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God

Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for
Christians How to recognize the Second Coming

The Messiah should not claim to be God  What sets a Messiah apart is
that he is born without original sin  He is not born perfect but
achieves perfection after a period of growth  Adam and Eve were born
sinless but they fell and this tragedy meant that it would take God
thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God
originally intended  God's restoration providence is still not
complete  The messiah is the true Son of God one with God God's
representative on the earth but not God himself  There is only one
God

 Mark    And then if any one says to you 'Look here is the Christ' 
 or 'Look there he is' do not believe it 

 Mark    And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with 
 great power and glory 

 My understanding of Jesus' answer is that unlike his first coming
 which was veiled the second coming will be quite unmistakeable

 By the way from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me
 that he is claiming to be Christ

Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah  Maybe he's already here

 and many others mailed me  Here is a reply to one of the letters  Seems to
me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell

There's nothing like a preacher to put fear into an
     ignorant man

If God hadn't created Hell in the first place there'd be no
     no need to die and save us  Isn't it also a bit paradoxical
     to say God died when in fact no such thing is remotely
     possible  Can the infinite die

Your using th century concepts to interprete st century writers  Of course
in your termonology God could not cease to exist  However that is not what
death ever means in the Scriptures  If you will study the word you will see
that it signifies separation  Death is separation not ceastation  This is
the reason for the agony of the cross  For the first time in eternity one
member of the Godhead was separated from the other two  

I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived 
She was as personable as any saint ever imagined  She was to become my
girlfriend for several years  However having been drafted we were
separated by distance  To me that was a form of death  Later she decided
that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue  That to me was
death  It was separation from that which had made me whole  Death is
separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship not
because He chose to send you into outer darkness but because you chose to go
there  

 did you know that Jesus talked more
 about hell than He did about heaven  

Thank you for this info  What respect I had for the man now
     has been diminished tenfold  I promise never again to
     say how wise or loving this man was

When I rebelled against my earthly father he spanked me  I found no wisdom in
that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children  He
was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued
on my suicidal course  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and
unloving  If God warns of impending danger that is love  If choose to let us
do as we please and then at the end tell us the rules that would be harsh 
You have a conscience no matter how calused or fallen it is that witnesses to
you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear  

Being Jesus was allegedly God I doubt he could honestly feel
     the pinpricks man dealt him

This may give light to the error of your understanding  One must have correct
knowledge in order to have correct faith  Faith and knowledge are inseparable
 Jesus most certainly felt the pinpricks of life  As the Scripture say

Heb  For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our
weaknesses but One who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without
sin

The kenosis passage of Phil  states that He gave up His Godhead attributes
when He took upon Himself humanity  It has been a favorite meditation of mine
to think about this  It was to be my PhD thesis  The Consciousness of
Christ  I have talked at length with a great many people about this
interesting study including clh  

It is my conclussion that as Jesus the nd member of the Trinity actually
suffered as we do  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we
do  He grew in knowledge  He chose not to grasp His omniscience but chose
to be taught  It is my understanding that He was led of the Spirit to such
an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and
Jesus as God  But in Jn  where the adulterous women was thrown before Him
the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise 
That is He was not aware that this event was to take place in time  He was
living sequential history as you or I  

Maybe some other time we can discuss this but it is a very lengthy discussion
and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than
not

Thanks again for the info  Just so you know some friends and I
     are starting a Freethinkers organization and I'm going to
     use some of the info you provided for an organization intro
     duction 

I was once a member of that club  THe free thinker is a glorious ideal  By
contrast of course you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository
of everything that is dogmatic inhibited reactionary and repressive  I find
such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd   If the liberal humanist
wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist that is his right 
But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his rational
doubt when in fact he was led to it by his faith  He must acknowledge that
while it is rational doubt for him as a free thinker to criticize the
Christian it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize
him as a humanist  If there is no faith there can be no dout  There is no
faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith

Pascal pointed out that sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive
 Few  speak dubiously of scepticism  The fact that skeptics are not
skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must
believe in something else  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or
even most faiths will be the devoted adherent of another  In fact it is a
measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define
himself only in negative terms hence the term atheist

Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism  In
my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember 
However they disproved their own argument with every thought every word
every point of logic that they used  Every moment of shared communication
speaks against their total skepticism  Their very insistence of trying to make
sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent

That is to say that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism
is arbitrary  Next time you're in a room of skeptics yell out Look your fly
is undone  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he
believes without skepticism  To stress this is to belabor the obvious but it
underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he
knows  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity 
The answer to this impasse lies in  a rd way of knowing one which is based on
presuppositions  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before
it is proved the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt and
critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective
and neutral  In other words another myth  

Presuppositions my friend  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is
something we do not doubt our own assumptionspresuppostions  Even these can
be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions  Presuppostitons are
our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for
absence

  I tell you what if God condemns me for being honest He is
    unworthy of my worship  Better to burn in Hell than to
     serve a tyrant in Heaven

Of course that is hardly an original statement  Milton coined it but it had
been in use for millenia  It was even used in the first Highlander movie 
But again your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of
God  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic
theology not what He has revealed of Himself through history through His
prophets through His Word and lastly but most of all thru His Son  If you
are to reject God's annointed savior then reject Him from a correct
understanding of Himself

But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a
nonexistent danger  Analogies can only push an argument so far on both
sides  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your
respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise

The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from
Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right
and duty to tell the TRUTH to all  

Christians can get offended if others do not believe what is selfevidently
to them the TRUTH Nonchristians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get
offended at them because they christians claim to know the TRUTH

The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true because the 
question under discussion is not truth but arrogance 

A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood 
transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are 
Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood 
transfusion The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood 
transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as 
Christians could be perceived to be arrogant

The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary 
to save the life of the child is irrelevant here What matters is that the 
doctor BELIEVES it to be true and could be seen to be trying to foce his 
beliefs on the parents and this could well be perceived as arrogance

I find it interesting that cls never answered any of the questions posed 
Then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder  He has
established a twotiered God  One set of rules for the Jews his people
and another set for the saved Gentiles his people  Why would God
discriminate  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the
Gentile rules
 
God has one set of rules for all his people  Paul was never against the
law  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls
the law  Paul's point is germane to both Jews and Greeks  The Law can
never be used as an instrument of salvation  And please do not combine
the ceremonial and moral laws in one
 
In Matt  Christ plainly says what He came to do and you say He was
only saying that for the Jews's benefit  Your Christ must be a
politician speaking from both sides of His mouth  As Paul said I have
not so learned Christ  Forget all the theology just do what Jesus says
 Your excuses will not hold up in a court of law on earth far less in
God's judgement hall

Pardon me for being a little confused but at the beginning of your second 
paragraph you say God has one set of rules for all his people yet at the 
end of the same paragraph you declare please do not combine the ceremonial 
and moral laws in one  Not only do I not understand where in the Bible you 
find the declaration that there are  laws ceremonial and moral but I am 
also unclear on whether you think it is bad to have  sets of laws in the first 
place  If it's bad to have  sets of laws how can there be a ceremonial law 
that is different from the moral law and vice versa

I would also be interested in your comments on the passage in I Cor  
where Paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying 
depending on whether you are a man or a woman  Do you think the apostles can 
prescribe different sets of rules for men and women  If so then why not for 
Jews and Gentiles  Also why did Paul who was so opposed to circumcising 
Gentiles voluntarily circumcise Timothy

Re Are you Christian or Pauline
Both

Sure why not But are you using Paul to correct the words of Jesus

There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is
not at least not in this case  Jesus did not deal explicitly with
the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles 

So anyone who dissolves even one of the smallest commands and teaches
others the same way will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the
skies whereas anyone who keeps the commands and teaches them too will
be known as someone great in the kingdom of the skies Mat Gaus

Are you an anyone or are you a no one

Why not assume that since Jesus didn't say that his words apply only to
Jews that they apply to all human beings irregardless of race or sex

Why not assume that even though Jesus did not mention your name still
Jesus was talking directly to you

That's why I
have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion
As to general Jewish views on this I am dependent largely on studies
of Pauline theology one by HJ Schoeps and one whose author I can't
come up with at the moment  Both authors are Jews  Also various
Christian and nonChristian Jews have discussed the issue here and in
other newsgroups
Mat  is clear that the Law is still valid  It does not say that
it applies to Gentiles

Does it say that it applies to you Are you anyone or no one

And yes I say that the specific requirement for worship on the
Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail when you're
looking at the obligations of Gentiles

ExJPS Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy Six days you
shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath of
the LORD your God you shall not do any work  you your son or
daughter your male or female slave or your cattle or the stranger who
is within your settlements For in six days the LORD made heaven and
earth and sea and all that is in them and He rested on the seventh
day therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it

Note There is no specific requirement for worship here however I for
one would not be so bold as to call these verses a ceremonial detail

Similarly circumcision

Don't many Christians still practice circumcision

I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject  Again it's
unfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly

It's unfortunate that Jesus didn't use your name directly or maybe
Jesus did Are you somebody or nobody

However we
do know  what the st Cent Jewish approach was  how Jesus
dealt with at least one Gentile and  how Jesus' disciples dealt
with the issue when it became more acute I'm referring to Acts 
more than Paul  Given that these are all in agreement I don't see
that there's a big problem

If you don't see a problem then perhaps there is none As Paul closes
Romans  Gaus

  In short pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up
Don't let dietary considerations undo the work of God Everything may be
clean but it's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit
Better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your
brother is offended by As for the faith that you have keep that
between yourself and God The person is in luck who doesn't condemn
himself for what he samples On the other hand the person with doubts
about something who eats it anyway is guilty because he isn't acting on
his faith and any failure to act on faith is a sin

As far as I know Christians except specific Jewish Christian
groups and maybe some of the sabbatarians  both of which are very
small groups do not practice circumcision on religious grounds  In
some countries it has been done for supposed health reasons but I've
not heard it argued that it is being done because of the Biblical
commandment  clh

 exactly what Jesus Paul and company were trying to say is not always so
 easy  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should
 behave that way  Rather he was trying to say that under the circumstances
 at the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and
 cover their heads  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward
 others  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived
 from absolutes  For instance it is absolutely right for Christians to
 strive for peace  However this does not rule out trying to maintain world
 peace by resorting to violence on occasion  Yes my opinion

I agree that there is truth in scripture  There are principles to be 
learned from it  Claiming that that truth is absolute though seems 
to imply a literal reading of the Bible  If it were absolute truth 
constant across time culture etc then no interpretation would be 
necessary

I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation
That's because truth may be absolute but it may not be obvious  Like
so many things the truth is always subject to misinterpretation

I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here which is why I
deign from commenting much further

 Sure  The Bible preaches absolute truths  However exactly what those
 truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion  As I said the Bible does
 preach absolute truths  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal
 clear at least to evangelicals  

This is where the arrogance comes in to play  Since these principles 
are crystal clear to evangelicals maybe the rest of us should just take
their word for it  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to me that 
their fundamental principles are either fundamental or principles

Now hold it  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant  Indeed as
many other Christians on SRC have stressed before this is a trap that
Christians must always be wary about  However this does not mean that if
you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible you are necessarily
being arrogant  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute
but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone
 
So I think that your position is
The Bible is absolute truth but as we are prone to error in our 
interpretation we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out 
what that truth is
Did I get that right

Not quite  You say that according to my stance we cannot reliably
determine what is true  That is not what I said  I say that as fallible
human beings we cannot discern the truth with  certainty  The 
distinction is subtle yet important

When a scientist performs an experiment he can claim that his results
are reliable without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could
have been made  In other words he can admit that he could be mistaken
without sacrificing his convictions

Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with  certainty
Throughout the centuries philosophers have argued about what we can know
with complete certainty and what we cannot  Descartes made a step in the
right direction when he uttered Cogito ergo sum yet we have not advanced
much beyond that

Do you believe that other people aside from you exist  Do you believe that
the computer terminal you are using exists  If so can you be absolutely
certain about that  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion  Of course
you have no such assurance  This does not mean however that for all
practical purposes you can be certain that they exist  So it is with
Christianity  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about
absolute morality yet they acknowledge that there is a nonzero probability 
that they are wrong  This does not however mean that they should or do 
abandon these absolutes

What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending 
absolute truth when we can never know what those truths are and we 
can never or at least shouldn't act upon them  What practical 
difference can this make

As I said we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct  This does
not mean that we cannot be certain enough in light of the evidence to 
render all doubts unreasonable

 Chris Mussack writes
  For all those people who insist I question authority Why
 
 Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things  People who just
 follow orders have tortured and killed others in very large numbers
 and protest their innocence afterwards
 
The basic question here is how do I know what I am supposed to do
This is true in every situation that comes up Some people do not
think about it at all and merely follow their impulses I claim
that is just as dangerous as following authority I could site
sexually transmitted diseases drug abuse all manner of criminal
activity the savings and loan scandal car accidents eggs thrown
at my house all are examples of people not following authority
I could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the 
problem was a leader not following his authority and doing what 
he wanted Of course where is the top of the chain Therein lies 
our search
 
 When your authority starts telling you to do things you should ask
 questions  Except for situations of pressing need I said shut the
 hatch because the submarine is filling with water any reasonable
 authority should be able to give at least some justification that you
 can understand

I don't think it's as simple as you are claiming Pressing need is
ambiguous Should I recycle or not 
 
Realize that I have four kids who despite being very precocious 
of course are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding
the tremendous knowledge I wish to impart to them

 Just be sure to listen when authority answers

Ahh An ironic ending
 
The irony I was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper 
sticker cliche Question Authority was that I was questioning 
the authority of the person telling me to question authority
It seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning
only in being different only in rebelling forsaking everything
for the sake of freedom I question their integrity and fortitude 
There is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly
Different people are at different levels of development in different
areas Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities
to follow we can't know everything about everything Often 
when learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher
perhaps blindly Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate
questions should I question him only when I have developed
my skills enough should I challenge him Once again how do I know
when I get to those stages

If you have to be told to question authority perhaps you shouldn't

I've just read Carol's response and I just had to get into this  I've
got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say
what they say  They are  Peter   Timothy  and
Galatians   

Also based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges
people if they follow him see Acts  and John  and that
those who reject Jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke
see John  then Jesus' words are true and do not need
interpretation nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word
if it had to be interpreted

 Well you know that religion has caused more wars than
 anything else
 It bothers me that I cannot seem to find a satisfactory
 response to this After all if our religion is all about
 peace and love why have there been so many religious wars

Of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics
the answer would be that the cause of war was economic My observations
over the past  years and not withstanding a little history reading
beside is that while religious differences do play a part in many of
the conflicts so does unfortunately race economics and any other
items that identify one group of men as being different from another

If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms I would
put it while Christ died for our sins we are yet sinners While some
individuals assume Christlike natures most of us do not even
come close

I realize that in many ways this is a trite answer but I guess that
it is my way of rationalizing man's constant or so it seems
conflict

Julie it is a really trying situation that you have described  My
brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad
although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to
other problems with the relationship  Anyway the best thing to do
would be to get everyone in the same room together optimally in a room
with nothing breakable lock the door behind you throw the key out
underneath the door just as far as the longest hand can reach  You
would like to get out after the conclusion I would imagine and hash
things out  More than likely there will be screaming crying and
possibly hitting unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to
tie people down  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer
would include
   have each individual own their own statements ie I feel that this
relationship is hurting everyone involved because or I really don't
understand where you're coming from
   reinforce statements by paraphrasing etc ie So you think that we
did this because of  Well let me just say that the reason for this
was 
   don't accuse each other It was your fault that  happened
   find a common ground about SOMETHING Lampshades really are
decorational and functional at the same time
   Guaranteed in a situation like this there is going to be some
gunnysacking rehashing topics which were assumed resolved but were
truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame  However this
should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize
about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge  

The relationship really can work  It's just a matter of keeping things
smooth and even  It's sort of like making a peace treaty between
warring factions  you can't give one side everything there must be a
compromise  Breaks can be taken but communication between everyone
involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive

marriage if I remember aright base almost all their teachings on

should be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis

Actually there was very little to the book  First of all looking at
the titles of her other books I would personally consider her 
to be engaged in a bizarre form of Christianlike mysticism
heavily influenced by eastern philosphies great titles like 
TheAstrologyoftheHorsemen

However other than the Chapter One into there's nothing original
biased or even new this book  It is basically a collection of previously
published works by those who claim that there exist Buddhist and Hindu
stories that Christ visited India and China he was known as Issa 
during the period from late teens to age 

Conclusion  the book actually lets you come to your own view by presenting
a summary of various published works and letters all of which you
could verify independently  It includes refutations to such works as
well  Therefore even if you think she is theologically warped this 
book is a nice reference summary for the interested

First I thank collectively all people who have given good answers
to my questions In my followup to Jason Smith's posting I will
address some issues that have caused misunderstanding

Jason Smith jasonsatlastelecom wrote

 In article Aprathosrutgersedu kempmpphoenixoulufi Petri Pihko writes

 I also concede that I was doubly remiss as I asserted No reasonable
 alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one
 that could  be invalidated given time and further discovery by the
 scientist  I also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily
 specify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description of
 the phenomena in question  Am I mistaken with this understanding

Yes to some degree There was an excellent discussion in sciskeptic
on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago I hope it did not
escape your notice 

The correct word is 'likely' There is no way to be sure our models and
theories are absolutely correct Theories are backed up by evidence
but not proved  no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense

However theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of
phenomena It is extremely important to test whether theories can
predict something new or not yet observed All successful theories
science has come up with have passed this test including the Big
Bang theory of cosmic evolution the theory of natural selection etc
It does not mean they must be correct but they are not mere
'best fits' for the data 

  But if you claim that there must be
  an answer to how did the universe our spacetime  emerge from 
  nothing science has some good candidates for an answer

 All of which require something we Christians readily admit to Faith''

Well yes if you want to believe in them This is not what science
requires  take a good look at the theory and the evidence see if
the theory has made any successful predictions and use your reason
Disbelievers are not punished 

 The fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive  
 With out conclusive evidence we are left with faith

This is what puzzles me  why do we need to have faith in anything
My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist  someone who is
unable to believe ie fails to entertain any belief in God 

Yes I know that one can't believe without God's help Luther makes
this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus I'm afraid this does not
change my situation 

  a couple of paragraphs deleted  Summary we ask Why does the
 universe exist 


  I think this question should actually be split into two parts namely
  
   Why is there existence Why anything exists
  
  and
  
   How did the universe emerge from nothing

deletions

  The question why anything exists can be countered by
  demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness
  or in nonexistence  Actually both questions turn out to be
  devoid of meaning Things that exist do and things that don't exist
  don't exist Tautology at its best

 Carefully examine the original question and then the counterquestion 
 The first asks Why while the second is a request for definition 

No it is not although it does look like one This is a true dichotomy
either something exists or nothing exists If nothing exists nobody
would ask why If something exists it is possible to ask why but
actually no existing being could give an answer 

Imagine for a moment that the nobodies in nonexistence could also
ask Why nothing exists This is equivalent to my counterquestion
why nothing exists in nothingness 

Now why anything exists is equivalent to why something exists in
somethingness  This is what I meant with my tautology my apologies
for the poor wording in my previous post

 I might add the worldview of Things that exist do and things that
 don'tdon't is as grounded in the realm of the nonfalsifiable
 as does the theist's belief in God  It is based on the assumption
 that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately
 unsupportable as the position of there being a reason  Its very
 foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a
 reason

I do indeed think there probably is no reason for being or existence
in general for reasons I stated above However they will still
leave open the question why this and not that and this is where
theistic explanations come in

Science cannot give reasons for any particular human being's existence

 We come to this Either I am therefore I am or I am for a reason

This is a deep philosophical question  is determinism true or not
Also is God deterministic or not I tend to think this question has
no meaning in His case 

If I am for a reason I've yet failed to see what it would be 
From our perspective it looks like 'I' exist for truly random
reasons I just rolled two dice  why did I get  and  How can
I believe there is any better reason for my existence

 If the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are
 satisfied and need not a doctor  If the latter your search is just
 beginning  

Yes I am satisfied with this reason until I find something better
My  years of Christianity were of no help in this respect I have
to admit but I am patient

  Another answer is that God is the source of all existence
  This sounds much better but I am tempted to ask Does God
  Himself exist then If God is the source of His own existence
  it can only mean that He has in terms of human time always
  existed But this is not the same as the source of all existence

 This does not preclude His existence  It only seeks to identify His
 qualities implying He exists to have qualities BTW

No it doesn't but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists
for an answer to this question is not knowable Of course this
should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence

 I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why   It
 appears that M Pihko agrees as we shall see  But because a tool is
 inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question  Asserting
 that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer  

It is impossible to know unknowable things However the question 
why do I exist in particular is not an invalid question  this
is not what I said But from our perspective it is impossible to
tell and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of
another especially since I found I was deluding myself 

 My apologies  I was using why as why did this come to be  Why did
 preexistence become existence  Why did prespacetime become spacetime

I think preexistence is an oxymoron There is no time 'outside' of
this spacetime except in some other universe and from that 
perspective our universe never was It exists only for those who
are inside it 

 But we come to the admission that science fails to answer Why  Because
 it can't be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the
 question invalid

No The validity of the question has to be discussed separately I think
philosophy is of great help here What can be known and what is not
knowable

 M Pihko does present a good point though  We may need to ask What do I 
 as an individual Christian base my faith on  Will it be shaken by the
 production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to
 understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God said and
 continues to say in his Word

This is a very good question In trying to answer this and numerous
other questions that bothered me I finally found nothing to base
my faith on 

I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves why do I believe
or why I don't believe

clittonandybgsuedu  Thanks in advance

I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians but I might know more 
than most

The Branch Davidian group led by Koresh is actually one of two offshoots 
of a group known as the Shephard's Rod  The Shephard's Rod now 
defunct as far as I knowbroke off from the SDA Church in the 's

The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the 
SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy  They felt that they 
were the remnant spoken about in Revelation

About the Koresh group Koresh gained control of it in  or   Once 
in control he made himself the center of it He proclaimed himself as 
Christ

Koresh himself came from an SDA background He was excommunicated as a young 
adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over 
the youth in the church  After this he joined the Branch Davidians

They wereare a survivalist cult This is why they had the stockpile of 
weapons food a bomb shelter etc  They had no intent of raiding the US 
government or anything They were preparing for Armaggedon and were 
putting themselves in a self defense position  

In my opinion if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone we wouldn'
t have the blood of  children crying out from the ashes in Waco

If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod you might want to visit the 
local SDA church and talk to some of the older people  They could give you 
some insight into where Koresh got his theology

  Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since
the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such  
 
This is something I've always found confusing  If all your nerve endings
die with your physical body why would flame hurt you  How can one wail
and gnash teeth with no lungs and no teeth

One can feel physical pain by having a body which if you know the
doctrine of the resurrection of the body is what people will have after
the great judgement  We look for the resurrection of the dead and the
life of the world to come   NiceneConstantinopolitan Creed  You
will have both body and soul in hell  eventually

Now this is getting interesting

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist so I have stated
this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about   For some
reason I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the
resurrection of the soul but I guess resurrection does strictly mean
the raising of the physical body  I have some questions on this point

  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was 
pretty much immediate and that there are people burning in hell right
now  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the
great judgement which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day
I was always a little confused on this point even when I was with the
church  maybe someone can clear it up for me  Where will my soul
which by the way I don't believe in exist until that time

  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms 
that my body now is made of or will it be built from scratch  My
physical body now is susceptible to aging etc  so I guess my
new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal
so it can be tortured for all eternity

  Since I will have a physical body I assume it will need a physical
place to exist in  where is this hell  In the center of the earth
Do you think we could find it if we dig

Mark Schnitzius
schnitzieolacsucfedu
Univ of Central Florida

There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife  I
think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur
until a final judgement which is still in the future  In the
meantime some believe that people sleep until the final
resurrection or because God is above time pass directly from death
to the future time when the resurrection occurs while others believe
that souls have a disembodied preresurrection existence until then
There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting

The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a
different technology than the current one one which is not mortal
Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality and Jesus'
resurrected body  which is the first example  clearly was not
subject to the same kind of limitations as ours  It is assumed that
there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other
but I don't think most people claim to know the details  I don't
think I'd say it's the same atoms  I'd assume there would be some
analog of a physical place but I wouldn't expect to find it under the
earth or up in the sky  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension
outside this physical world or whatever  But again we have little
in the way of details

On the question Does God hear the prayers of sinners we need to
distinguish
If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned we
make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than  centuries
ago
But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner of someone
who says Lord I want you to do this for me but don't expect me
to change my way of life that is a different matter 

I have no doubt that God hears everybody's prayers
However He does things His way ie things will happen
only if it is His will

Now if the question really is Does God grant everybody's wishes 
then you'll get a brutal shot of reality similar to when you didn't
get that toy you wanted for Christmas You just cannot expect
to get everything you want in this world

 I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
 couple become married in God's eyes  Some say that if the two have
 publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to God and
 are unswervingly committed to one another I realize this is a subjective
 qualifier they are marriedjoined in God's sight

The way I read Scripture a couple becomes married when they are physically
married ie when they first have sexual intercourse

Some years ago an Anglican synod was discussing the marriage canons and 
there was some debate on what actually constituted a marriage

The bishop of Natal whose wife of many years had died and who had recently 
remarried announced It MUST be consummated and looked like that cat that 
got the cream

So I suppose he at least would agree with you

 I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere
 man even if he did claim to be the son of God andor a prophet

I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking  what distinguishes
true religion from cults I'm speaking generally here not specifially
about Christianity  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on 
Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question  Basically he said that
true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person
But then Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity
IS the person of Jesus  So what distinguishes for example the
Branch Davidian cult from the Presbyterian church  Doctrinal
differences don't answer the question IMHO so don't use them as
an answer

There have been some attempts to characterize cult  Most commonly
it uses characteristics involving high pressure brainwashing
techniques etc  But some people characterize it by doctrinal
error  In the end I'm afraid it becomes a term with no precise
meaning that's used primarily to dismiss groups as not worthy
of serious consideration  That doesn't mean that there aren't
groups that do highly irresponsible things and have serious
doctrinal errors  But past discussions have not suggested to me
that cult is a very helpful term  clh

 The Bible's message is that we are to love all people and
 that all people are redeemable  It preaches a message of
 repentance and of giving  Unfortunately all people have
 deceitful hearts and are capable of turning this message
 around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways
 This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine

Andrew

   How I wish this were true and how I long for the day in which it will
be true  But alas it is not true of history  The Bible does not have a 
message  it has messages  And some of those are messages of repentance and
giving to turn the other cheek and do unto the least of these  But some
of the messages are the complete opposite  Like the isrealites order to 
wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle and 
punished severely when they were less than complete about the job  Like
jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew His blood be upon our heads
and our childrens heads A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to
the holocaust  Have these been misunderstood  I think not  They have only
been understood too clearly  It is essential that christians grasp firmly
the good the bible teaches the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent 
symbol for how we should be his teachings we must take to heart but we
cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and
say those who live by that have misread it  To say that is only to chose a
point of interpretation and declare it normative  Such can be done with the
same legitmacy by anyone  Instead we must let the text critique the text
Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus we test
all things and hold fast to that which is good 
 
 
 ps I believe that a line of questioning like you presented
 is strangely enough compatible with becoming a Christian
 Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour
 of the world and especially Christians  I praise God for
 Jesus Christ and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs
 and still come back to God and be forgiven time and time
 again
 

At the risk of sounding heretical well ok more heretical I don't think
that doubt is something which requires forgiveness it is something which
requires introspection and reflection  If that is a sin then there can
be no salvation for doubt is an inescapble part of being human  Consider
Job  His friends had no doubt Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but
doubted the wisdom and justice of God  When God finally did appear he 
rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them  To be a Christian
it to always have doubt or not to have honesty

 I've just read Carol's response and I just had to get into this  I've
 got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say
                        
 what they say  
  
Joe just 'cause you say they aren't subject to interpretation doesn't
necesarily make it so  That's your interpretation of these texts

 They are  Peter   Timothy  and
 Galatians   

 Peter 
But know this first of all that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter 
of one's own interpretation for no prophecy was ever made by an act of
human will but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God

The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 
Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you

 Timothy 
All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching for
reproof for correction for training in righteousness that the man of
God may be adequate equipped for every good work

Galations 
For I would have you know brethren that the gospel which was preached
by me is not according to man  For I neither received it from man 
nor was I taught it but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus
Christ

When I read these passages it was not immediately clear to me what
every phrase meant  I had stop and think about the possible
connotations of words what the intent of the author may have been
wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the 
same meaning I had to interpret  If you want to believe that your 
are not interpreting Scripture as you read there's probably nothing 
I can say to change your mind  But I think it's naive to think that 
our culture experiences education do not affect everything we read

 Also based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges
 people if they follow him see Acts  and John  and that
 those who reject Jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke
 see John  then Jesus' words are true and do not need
 interpretation nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word
 if it had to be interpreted

In college I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation  Go to
any Christian bookstore there are scores of books on interpreting and
understanding Scripture  If interpretation is unnecessary there are 
an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time 
and energy on it

OFM replies to a question on the multiplicity of translations of the bible

As far as I know no Christians
believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of
translating is free of error  

Unfortunately this isn't true  On another news group earlier this year
someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version
of the Bible in English and was therefore inerrant all other English
translations were from Satan trying to deceive the body of Christ  A
few years ago the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster
advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations
Very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV
The idea that the KJV is THE English Bible is more prevalent than many
might think

D Andrew Kille writes

Are you suggesting that God supports genocide
Perhaps the Germans were punishing Jews on God's behalf
 
Any God who works that way is indescribably evil and unworthy of
my worship or faith

The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God Romans 
 And furthermore God foreknows everything that would happen  It is
just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds the
inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan and this is especially hard to
grasp when we see governemnts doing evil  However though they are
doing evil and we should not cooperate with them when they do such it
must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to
the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is
possible  In short the slaughter in Bosnia though deplorable in the
eyes of God maybe then again they might be getting their just deserts
now rather than later there are plenty of examples of God killing
people for their sins  Onan in the Old Testmament for example and
Annias and Spahira in the New is what he willed to happen so that His
plan might be accomplished
    But don't forget it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to
execute His just judgement upon another  The Romans were used to
fulfill the chorus of Let his blood be upon our hands of the crowd in
Jersualem  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon which got Israel
which was inturn gotten by Persia etc  God does use nations to punish
other nations as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament 
Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel Mene mene
tekel peres  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's
justice found severly wanting and was thus given over to the Persians
as their due punishment for their rebellion  Another exammple is the
extirmination of the Cannanites ordered by God as the task of Israel 
The Cannanites had been given their chance found severly wanting and
the Great Judge carried out His just sentence accrodingly  I could go
on with more examples but I see little need to do so as my point is
quite clear
Two things need to be remembered at all times  It is not up to us to
question why God has ordered the world as He has  In His divine Wisdom
He made the world as was best in His eyes and like Paul says in Romans
 the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter   The message of
Jesus Christ is as follows Repent now for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dillydallying  Let
the dead bury the dead come follow me  There is not an infinite
amount of time rather Christ is passing by right now calling people to
follow Him and become fishers of men  He does not say well alright
you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your
plans  He said Follow me  His message is NOT I'm just a sweetypie
who would never hurt a fly you've got all the time in the world and
Divine Judgement that's only a fairy tale  Our great God and Savior
Jesus Christ Titus  is also the just and righteous Judge of the
world  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be
questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy

I see some irony here Jesus was willing to go through torture to free

but rather than allow him to stand in your place you would give up
your redemption to stand with those who do not accept his grace
God would rather have none in hell which seems to put the burden of 
choice on us Of course this is all fictional anyway since you reject him

Here are some notes about what the church is to be like and some helpful
ideas about how to choose a church

Colossians 
   A  Jesus is the head of the body the church
   B  You cannot say yes to Jesus but no to the church

Ephesians 
   A  The church is the family of God
   B  The church is based on the Word of God only
          CornerstoneChrist
          Foundation ApostlesNew Testament
                      ProphetsOld Testament  see Revelation 

 Corinthians 
   A  Baptism is when we become a member of the church

As for the question of denominations
   A  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians
 Romans   Corinthians 
   B   Corinthians  says that there should be no divisions in
the church  There should be no following of personalities in the church
and in time their writings
   C  There are so many churches today because of a problem   Timothy
 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a
church that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle

Hebrews 
   A  Do not miss church
   B  Purpose is to encourage each other so we will remain faithful
Involved on a relationship level in the church
   C  Must come to ALL services

Another verse which is helpful is Hebrews   The church should be
encouraging daily as it is their duty to do

Of course more standards apply
    Timothy   People in the church should be watching their lives
and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely ie
disciples
   Acts   The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul
natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly
face to face so if the Bereans who were considered noble didn't take
Paul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify
his statements then church members are to do the same and verify the
pastor's statements  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of
other verses then that group should be avoided as a church would've
made a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group especially in light of
Matthew

i have a question for you all related to this  jesus condemns divorce
several times in the new testament and i have a hard time with this
the catholic church as far as i can tell does grant annulments with
the statement that the marriage never really existed in God's eyes
please if i am mistinterpreting correct me  however i have
witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but
recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by
staying in a marriage and that the problems were due to personal
childhood issues that had never been resolved  i ask you is divorce
justified in such a case  they knew who they were what they were
doing they were deeply in love but in the end it did not work out
i must admit that i don't see jesus forcing them to live together or
even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else

I own you	       Trinity		     no disclaimer  what
	 Lard	     	 St Patrick's Breastplate  is there to disclaim


This is a commonly discussed question though it's been long enough
that I'll allow it to be asked  As you might expect there is a range
of answers  Catholics and some others will say that divorce is never
justified  By the way in situations where someone is being abused
or for other serious cause separation is allowed by all traditions
that I know  No one should be forced to stay in a situation where
they are in danger  Others see it as a last resort in situations
that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is
to choose the lesser of evils  In some sense the difficult legal
question turns out not to be divorce but remarriage  That's because
of Jesus' statement in Mark  and par  As with so many other
things this turns on your approach to the Bible  Conservative
Protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions
More liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where
a literal interpretation would lead to painful results  It is noted
that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost
on a whim  Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is
that Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing not
to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be
exceptions  Catholics as is typical with Catholic ethics take a
theoretical hard line but allow for exceptions in practice through
the process of anullment  In the last discussion most of our
nonCatholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that
in some cases there might be no good alternative but there was a
feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of
helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that
come up during it and that in a properly run church divorce
should not be necessary  clh

Hi

I don't know much about Bible Could you tell me the relations of
Christians with nonChristians in Bible How should be The relations of
christian nations with each other and the relations of Christian nations
with other nations who are not Christians

The other question is about the concept of religion in Bible Does the
religion of God include and necessitate any law to be extracted from
Bible or is the religion only a belief and nothing to do with the
government sides If for example any government or a nation is one of
the wrongdoings according to Bible how should they be treated 

Is there any statement in Bible saying that Bible is a guide for every
aspects of life  

Thank you

just picked out this one point because it struck me
why do you believe this  muslims believe in many of the same things
that christians and jews believe they believe jesus while not the
messiah is a prophet  this seems to me to be much closer to
christianity than other religions are  then again i tend to be
somewhat liberal about others' beliefs

this also relates to the serbian ethnic cleansing question  i have
been waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few  HOW
can we stand by and watch innocent people even people whose beliefs
we condemn if this is the case and don't get me wrong the things
fundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil be
tortured raped the stories about that made me physically ill and
killed  jesus loves all not just those who love him back  and he
would advocate kindness toward them in the hopes of converting them
if that's the way you want to put it rather than killing them

I am also worried about this issue  I've made a posting under my own
name earlier today  I do not much want to discuss Moslem beliefs
here  This isn't the right group for it  Their beliefs about Jesus
appear to come as much from the Koran as the Bible  This means that
while they honor him what they think he did and stood for differs in
many ways from Christian beliefs about him  But Moslem beliefs are
an appropriate topic for socreligionislam

As I'm sure you know many Christians believe that you must accept
Christ in order to be saved  While Stanley's comment appears to be
antiMoslem I would assume he would say the same thing about all
religions other than Christianity

of the Church Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma  Ludwig Ott p 

All is not lost however as you still might belong spiritually to the
Church by your desire to belong to it  As you said only God can judge
the condition of a man's soul  About judgment on the other hand St Paul 
 Cor  urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians 
Following the Apostle's teaching I judge that you should reconsider   
returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham Isaac
and Jacob  He is the God who lives  

Concerning what you were told about nonbelievers when you were a catholic
that is true  As I have posted before Vatican II Lumen Gentium II   
n  teaches Those who through no fault of their own do not know
the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch but who nevertheless seek God with a
sincere heart and moved by grace try in their actions to do His will
as they know it through the dictates of their conscience  those too may
achieve eternal salvation  

Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes
of God the best I can do is refer you to Scripture  Scripture is one
of the best sources for learning what can be known about God

deletia sig
     ps  If you do sincerely believe that a god exists why do you follow
it blindly  
     Do the words Question Authority mean anything to you
     I defy any theist to reply      


deletia formalities

I probably should let this pass it's not worth the time and it's not
really intended for me But I couldn't resist A personal weakness of mine
Jerkius Kneeus Tragically incurable

The foundation for faith in God is reason without which the existence
of God could not be proven  That His existence can be proven by reason
is indisputable cf my short treatise Traditional Proofs for the 
Existence of God and Summa Theologica

Not so I can prove that the existance of God is disputable
by showing that people dispute it This is easy I dispute that
God exists Simple

I missed your Traditional Proofs treatise but the proofs I remember
from the Summa Theologic the  ways I think it was were rather poor
stuff The Ontological argument is about a billion times better imho

I would think you'd want nontraditional proofs considering the general
failure of the traditional proofs at least the ones I know of
I am thinking of the Ontological Argument the Cosmological Argument and
the Teleological argument Those are the ones traditional enough to
have funny names anyway

Now given that God exists and that His existence can be proven by reason
I assert that His commands must be followed blindly although in our fallen
condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith  Why

This is the real question So to discuss it I'll assume God exists
Otherwise there is no heavenly authority to babble about

Because God is the First Cause of all things the First Mover of matter
the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence the
Measure of all that is perfect and the essential Being who gives order
to the universe logos

Please show this is the case I am familiar with the First Cause
argument and I'll accept for the sake of argument that there
is a First Cause even though I find some of its premices
questionable The rest you'll have to show This includes
that the First Cause is God

I next assert that God is all good

Got it I deny that God is all good So there

  If this is so then that which is
contrary to the will of God is evil ie the absence of the good  And
since God can never contradict Himself then by His promise of a Savior
as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis  God instructs that because
a human Adam was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source
of all good a man would be required to act to restore the friendship
Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah

This isn't selfconsistent if humans must renew the relationship
then God incarnate or not can't do it Well unless you think God is
human Granted God made himself 'human' but this is nonetheless cheating
The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem
he caused God fixing it even by indirect means contradicts this

Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth John   If this claim
is true then we are bound by reason to follow Him who is truth incarnate

Why

Also why assume said claim is true anyway

If I claim to be Truth are you bound by reason to follow me

You next seem to have a problem with authority  Have you tried the United
States Marine Corps yet  I can tell you firsthand that it is an excellent
instructor in authority



Undoubtably Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the
Marines without question You seem to imply this about God and
that the Marines are similar in this respect If this is not what
you are trying to say they please explain what it is you are saying
as I have missed it

  If you have not yet had the privilege I will
reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned
and thus must be followed blindly

Why Why not question it Even if it is truth we cannot know this
certainly so why is it so irrational to question Perhaps we will
thus discover that we were wrong

You assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth But
I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth
How is it my assertion is less good than yours

  One may NOT deny the truth

Oh

I hereby deny 

I hope you'll agree  is the truth

Granted I look pretty damn silly saying something like that
but I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true

Now you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag
me off to the gulag No heaven lighting bolts either No mysterious
net outages I seem to be permited to say such things absurd or not

  For
example when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head he could
have denied that it happened but he did not  The laws of physics must
be obeyed whether a human likes them or not  They are true 

They are certainly not true At least the ones Newton derived are
not true and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small
distances We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always
works in all cases If we did Physics would be over already

Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth If we didn't
we'd still follow Aristotle I'd generalize this a little more
If you want to learn anything new you MUST question the things
you Know tm Because you can always be wrong

Therefore the Authority which is Truth may not be denied

Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied and may
not be Questioned and that God is Truth it only follows
that God may not be Denied or Questioned NOT that he must
be obeyed

We could unquestioningly DISobey him How annoying of us
But you have not connected denial with disobedience

This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory  Those who subscribe to
Biblical Archaeology Review will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone
complained about a Franklin Mint ad  BAR is a great magazine but the
contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads
is extreme  In this ad they were hawking a doll with a head based on the
famous bust of Nefertiti giving the face a typical dollpink complexion
The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that
Nefertiti was a beautiful black queen  This set off an exchange of
hotheaded letters than ran for several issues to the point where they had
an article from an Egyptologist titled Was Cleopatra Black  The answer
to the title is no she was greek

I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining  I
personally have seen only one blondhaired Jesus in the National Shrine in
Wash DC and I found it very jarring  Western representations vary
enourmously but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark
hair and beard of a sort that can be found modulo the nose all up and
down the Mediterranean

Also if what I remember is correct the Black Madonna doesn't represent
a person with negroid features  It is black because of an accident  Joe
Buehler

In the presence of all those marble statues one is prone to forget that
greeks are rather likely to have black hair  When one crosses the bosporus
the situation breaks down completely  Are Turks white  How about Persians
or various groups in the indian subcontinent  Was Gandhi white  How about
the Arabs  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side  And then
there are the Ethiopians

Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that any of these
people are white ie of the racist's race  If I may risk a
potentially inflammatory remark one undercurrent of this seems to be the
identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race  Considering
the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval
antisemitism on the other I don't think that this Jesus was white thesis
ever played the roles that some hold it did

Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine  It seems
awfully selfserving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group

Here is what I am looking for

  The Gay Agenda produced by Ty Beeson's group The Report

  John Ankerberg's recent series Understanding Homosexuality and

  James Kennedy's special on homosexuality which aired this week
and the portion of the previous week's program which discussed The
Gay Agenda

I will not pay money for copies since this is copyrighted material

somebody can think of something they would desire in trade please let
me know and I'll see what I can do

Oh BTW I'm watching the March On Washington right now on CSPAN

I found one thing of interest  General David Dinkins just finished

I don't suppose you'd be interested in hearing about the homosexual
agenda from homosexual Christians  These portrayals of the homosexual
agenda are regarded by some as being somewhat akin to trying to
understand fundamentalist Christianity by looking at the Branch

the groups claiming to change homosexuals  When our church the
Presbyterian Church USA looked into this issue even the
conservative members of the committee were concerned about how real
and longlasting the changes were  I'll be interested to get reports
from police and the press about the number of people participating

Can a theist be truly objective  Can he be impartial
     when questioning the truth of his scriptures or
     will he assume the superstition of his parents
     when questioning 

I've often found it to be the case that the theist
     will stick to some kind of superstition when
     wondering about God and his scriptures  I've
     seen it in the Christian the Jew the Muslim
     and the other theists alike  All assume that
     their mothers and fathers were right in the
     aspect that a god exists and with that belief
     search for their god
     
Occasionally the theist may switch religions or
     aspects of the same religion but overall the
     majority keep to the belief that some Creator
     was behind the universe's existence  I've
     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice
     versa I've known Christians who were once
     Jewish and vice versa and I've even known
     Christians who become Hindu  Yet throughout
     their transition from one faith to another
     they've kept this belief in some form of higher
     being  Why
     
It usually all has to do with how the child is
     brought up  From the time he is born the
     theist is brought up with the notion of the
     truth of some kind of scripture the Bible
     the Torah the Qur'an  etc  He is told
     of this wondrous God who wrote or inspired
     the scripture of the prophets talked about in
     the scripture of the miracles performed  etc
     He is also told that to question this as
     children are apt to do is a sin a crime
     against God and to lose belief in the scrip
     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell
     Thus by the time he is able to read the
     scripture for himself the belief in its truth
     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
     matter of course
     
But it doesn't stop there  Once the child is able
     to read for himself there is an endeavor to
     inculcate the child the right readings of
     scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant
     readings to gloss over the worse ones and to
     explain away the unexplainable with mystery
     Circular arguments selfevdent facts and
     truths unreasoning belief and fear of
     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat
     of every day  To doubt of course means wrath
     of some sort and the child must learn to put
     away his brain when the matter concerns God
     All of this has some considerable effect on the
     child so that when he becomes an adult the 
     superstitions he's been taught are nearly
     impossible to remove
     
All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can
     truly be objective when questioning God Hell
     Heaven the angels souls and all of the rest
     Can he for a moment put aside this notion that
     God does exist and look at everything from
     a unbiased point of view  Obviously most
     theists can somewhat especially when presented
     with mythical gods Homeric Roman Egyptian
      etc  But can they put aside the assumption
     of God's existence and question it impartially

This is ad hominem attack of the most basic kind  None of their
statements matter  they believe the way they do because they were

latter which is not surprising given the statistics  It's hard to
see how one could possibly answer a posting of this sort since any
answer could immediately be assumed to be just part of the

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on
the biblical text  Luke's account is highly suspect I would refer you to
the hermeneia commentary on Acts  

In article Aprgenevarutgersedu atahfsihfsicom  John Ata writes

 Even if there was no independent proof that Luke's account was
 valid I find it strange that you would take the negation of it as
 truth without any direct historical evidence at least that you've
 mentioned to back it up  The assertion was made unequivocally
 that no Christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in
 the Resurrection  Luke's account suggests otherwise and in the
 absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken
 then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect
 

John
The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response without
bothering to connect it with the other parts  I have repeatedly noted that
one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the
work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack  Once you have taken the time
to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship I think you will 
grasp more clearly what I am saying



 I think the original claim may have been somewhat more limited than
 this  It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn't
 be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs
 Thus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered
 for believing in the Resurrection  Rather the issue is whether
 those who witnessed it did
 
 I do agree that the posting you're responding to shows that there
 can be liberal as well as conservative dogmatism
 
 clh

Certainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most 
clearly  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a
belief for it to be true then surely David Koresh is the son of God  No
the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be
willing to die must be put to rest  The other problem is that it is so 
monologocentric  Even if the resurrection was a big deal which it doesn't
seem to have been for either Q Thomas or even John to a certain degree
there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been
doing together that would have been worth dying for  It is my belief that
even the idea of a mixed race community which brought down regionalnational
boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be
willing to die  Radical communties do that eg Jonestown Waco Warsaw etc
But my original point was that roman persecution which is the only persecution
we have documented proof of was not about whether a carpenter came back from
the dead  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman
or greek mind  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty ie
emperor worship would have been much more problematic  which has nothing
to do with the resurrection at all  When nero used christians as human 
torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a 
risen savior it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and
cannablism  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection
just cannot stand up to critical examination

               conflicts with your scientific knowledge of the world
              Does your religion require you to ignore physical realities that
               you have seen for yourself or makes logical sense to you
Basically we would like to know if you ever BELIEVED in something that your
REASONtells you is wrong

Question 
If you have had conflict how diddo you resolve the conflict

Question

	Jesus was born a Jew  We have biblical accounts of
both his mother's ancestry and his father's both tracing back
to David  It seems reasonable to assume therefore that Jesus
was Semitic
	As an interesting aside Jesus' being semitic makes him
neither white nor black and in some sense underscores the
point made earlier that his color was not important it was his
message his grace and his divinity that we should concentrate
on
	Finally I would direct anyone interested in African
involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of
the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter  I think it's chapter
  This is one of the earliest conversions and the eunuch
treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians was definitely
African  Because Ethiopia at that time indicated a region
just south of Egypt many also speculate that this man was not
only the first African Christian but the first black Christian
as well

Over the years I have met Christians who are not associated with
any local church and are not members of any local church This is
an issue that may be very personal but is important  What does
the Bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with
regard to this issue

This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much
and probably has not been studied much

As some of you may be aware I've posted a lot of articles lately on
personality typing of which the MBTI is a test vehicle  To come up
to speed just read 'altpsychologypersonality' andor ask for by
personality type summary file

One observation is that people have significantly different personalities
no question on this which seem to be essentially inborn  With respect
to church attendance and participation some people thrive on this while
other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more
solitary and contemplative lifestyle  that is they are deenergized if
confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of
people  Of course this is measured by extroversionintroversion

My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact and
create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted
there are many introverted characters in the Bible btw  I know I am
quite introverted in preference and find the 'pressure' by many churches
to participate to meet together in large groups etc to be very
uncomfortable  Knowing what I know now these churches have been overly
influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing
BTW there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion both
preferences have their place in the Body

Maybe I should define extrovertintrovert more carefully since these words
are usually not used correctly in our culture  The extrovertintrovert
scale is a measure of how a person is energized  The following is
excerpted from my summary

  Energizing  How a person is energized

        Extroversion E Preference for drawing energy from the outside
                          world of people activities or things

        Introversion I Preference for drawing energy from one's internal
                          world of ideas emotions or impressions


Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can
structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise
the Body of Christ instead of trying to change people's personalities
to fit them into a particular framework  I'm sure there are other aspects
of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among
their members to the detriment of all

 Those with Bibles on hand can give the exact chapter  verse
 At the time Jesus told Peter that he was the rock He said
 whatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven and 
 whatever you don't hold true won't be true in heaven
 
 Therefore with respect to marriage the ceremony has to be
 done by an RC priest No big parties required Just the priest
 the couple and witnesses Divorce is not allowed But anullments
 are granted upon approval by either the bishop or the Pope 
 not sure if the Pope delegates this function
 
Maybe I'm a little tired but I can't seem to follow the logic here If 
whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest
RC only apparently is required 

In fact if I read the next verse correctly Matthew  I understand that
for a marriage to take place only two are required to agree on earth touching
one thing and it shall be done

 The Lost Los Angelino              

Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any completely precise
statements about what is needed  As usual the current edition of
the Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague  I do know that the
priest is viewed as a witness and thus in some sense would not be
required  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid
any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment  The
community provides support to marriage and in cases of problems are
involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of
their commitment as possible  Thus marriage must be a public
commitment  The presence of a priest is required for a regular
marriage  Where I'm not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in
exceptional cases valid but irregular  Ne Temere  says that
no marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest according
to the Oxford Dictionary of the Church and they imply that the new
canon law retains this but I'd rather see a more recent and
authoritative source  Note that while a Catholic priest is required
for Catholics the Catholic church does recognize marriage between
baptized nonCatholics as valid without a priest  clh

To what follows our moderator has already answered the charge of 
arrogance more ably that I could have done so so I will confine
myself to answering the charge of illogic
 
In a previous article EugeneBigelowebaysuncom Geno says

If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong
then I don't have a belief This is simply what belief means

Unfortunatly this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when
it comes to their religion 

This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is or was
taught to think It is the fundamental premis A is not notA If a thing
is true then its converse is necessarilly false Without this basic 
asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible We
should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word believe
however The weak sense means I am not sure I believe Tom went to 
the library but he could have gone to the track The strong sense
means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought I believe 
that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws despite 
the fact that nature appears capricious and unpredictable Christian
belief is of the strong kind Though Christians may well hold beliefs
of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological 
topics
 
Some take it to the extreme and say that
their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings
then you won't be saved 

Note that these are two separate ideas Most hold the first view but the 
majority do not hold the second Is is again a matter of pure logic that
if Christanity is true then Hinduism for example must necessarilly be
false insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with Christaianity 
And as a matter of logic vice versa
 
It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim
to know what God thinkswants 

It is arrogant to claim to know what anyone thinks or wants unless 
they have told you Christians believe God has told us what he thinks
and wants

Especially when it's based upon your
interpretation of a book 

Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible but on the living
tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly
by the Holy Spirit The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition

The logic in the above statement is faulty
in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be
correct 

If depends what you mean by differing If I believe Tom is six feet
tall and you believe he weighs  pounds our beliefs differ but we 
may both be right If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive
that he is four foot nine one of us at least must be wrong
 
It's all about perception No two people are exactly alike
No two people perceive everything in the same way I believe that
there is one truth Call it God's truth a universal truth or call it
what you will I don't believe God presents this truth I think it is
just there and it's up to you to look for and see it through prayer
meditation inspir ation dreams or whatever Just because people may
perceive this truth differently it doesn't mean one is wrong and the
other is right 

Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being 
can find it You assert that anyone who believe that we can find 
absolute truth is mistaken In short you believe that anyone who
does not share your belief on this point is wrong QED

As an example take the question Is the glass half
empty or half full You can have two different answers which are
contradictory and yet both are correct So for your belief to be
true does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong

Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the
knowability of truth but simply with language Saying that the glass 
is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half
full it is the same fact expressed in different words The whole
point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist
and the optimist express the same fact
 
It is of course quite true that different people may express the 
same belief in different words It is also true that they may fail
to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief
and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart Great
scisms have occurred in just this way and much ecumenical work has
been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal
agreement in belief This does not mean in any sense that all beliefs
are equally valid Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict
some other beliefs that other people hold after all obfuscations
of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have
been stripped away some of the beliefs that some people hold must
necessarilly be false and it is neither arrogant nor illogical
to say so If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct 
but if Y is equivalent to notX then one of us is wrong and as long
as we hold our respective beliefs we must each regard the other 
as in error

FAQ and Darius' response deleted

Darius

It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ  I
think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another Rom  is
probably all that needs to be said  I accept that Darius is doing
what he does in honor of the Lord  I just wish he might equally
accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing
their best to honor the Lord

I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say  
I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord  Your mention of esteeming 
all days alike IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews  But 
no matter how you interpret that passage I do accept your worship on Sunday 
as being done in honor of the Lord in contrast with what many of my fellow 
SDA believers may believe  To me though the bible overwhelmingly points 
to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's 
deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage  To those who would 
attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic 
this is simply not the case  Rather keeping Saturday allows me a full day 
to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace


However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous
proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day  As I
indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited

Similarly with  Cor   It says
that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's
collection  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially
to do this or that they did it in their homes I can't disprove it
but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be
when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do
it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day

The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the 
Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the 
week was because that was when they received their weekly wages  Paul 
wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority before 
spending their money on other things  I do not have any proof in front of 
me for this though although it would explain why they would lay aside money 
in their homes instead of a meeting  

So I think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day
of every week simply means every time they gather for worship  

I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements
is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian
worship was

It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly 
worshipped on the first day  I assume that the christians in the NT 
regularly worshipped on the seventh day  But I agree with you that we only 
have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip 
was

 I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
 couple become married in God's eyes  Some say that if the two have
 publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to God and
 are unswervingly committed to one another I realize this is a subjective
 qualifier they are marriedjoined in God's sight

The way I read Scripture a couple becomes married when they are physically
married ie when they first have sexual intercourse

eg the end of Genesis  quoted from memory for this reason a man shall
leave his parents and be joined to his wife and they will become one flesh''
Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage

If you read through Genesis in particular you will often come across the
phraseology man lay with woman and she became his wife'' This
implies that she became his wife when they lay together ie at the
point of intercourse

Compare this with Jewish tradition Joseph when he heard that Mary
was pregnant had it in mind to divorce her quietly  but Mary and Joseph were
betrothed not married ie they were in a binding relationship which
required a divorce to get out of but marriage would not occur until Mary
and Joseph went to bed together

Compare with Christ and the Church Ephesians  Revelation  the church is
described as the bride'' of Christ but the marriage of the Lamb takes 
place when Jesus returns ie we are in a binding loverelationship with
Jesus but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will
take place I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse
because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God

In summary engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship but it is
not marriage A civil ceremony is not marriage either Marriage occurs at the
point when the betrothed couple go to bed together I don't mean to demean the
civil or church ceremony  ours was great I don't mean to be too pedantic
Historically I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony ie a
marriage recognised by the state has only been around in the West since
Napoleon who introduced it to keep tabs on the people although I'm ready to be
corrected on that point

This view obviously raises some questions

What about those who have had sex with one or more partners without considering
marriage Are those people also married''

If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse is it necessary
to be married in the eyes of the state I would say Yes because this honours
the laws of our nations in the West Although it is not illegal to sleep
together though unmarried in most Western countries I believe that it is God
honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before
actually consummating our marriage Its to do with our being salt and light and
also to do with how people will perceive us ie it is culturally insensitive
to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony

Responding to the moderator

In article Aprathosrutgersedu alvinspotColoradoEDU Kenneth Alvin writes

Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal 
sovereignty  What bothers me is when others suggest that in these 
matters of faith their specific beliefs are not only true to them 
but are absolute and should be binding on others  It follows from this
that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth and thus 
anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing
the wrong path  This is the arrogance I see a lack of respect for the
honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God

It is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own
ability to know the truth  There are also different paths in some
areas of practice  But I'd like to see more clarification about what
you mean when you reject the idea of saying their specific beliefs
are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on
others  If something is true it is true for everyone assuming that
the belief is something about God history etc

Yes I agree  What I'm trying to point out is that in matters of faith
ie tenets which are not logically persuasive one may be convinced
of the truth of certain things through for instance personal
revelation  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those
beliefs with others  And I don't think that its arrogant persay to
accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself  Where I think the
conflict arises is in assuming that where disagreements on beliefs
arise all others must have been given the same truth and that God 
must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would 
honestly agree  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone 
who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest that they are 
rejecting something they know to be truth because it is inconvenient 
for them or because they wish to spurn God

I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that all truths one 
holds are universal and absolute  And the problem I see with this is 
that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with
God  This does not mean there is no absolute truth just that some areas
of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or 
revealed that truth

       That argument would be more compelling if it were not for the
Ishtar eggs and Ishtar bunnies  Why mix pagan fertility symbols from the
worship of the pagan goddess of fertility with Biblical belief  What
would really be lost if all of you were to just drop the word Easter and
replace all such occurances with Resurrection Sunday  Would you not
show up for services if they were called Resurrection Sunday Services
rather than Easter Services  

There is another way to view this  The True Celebration is Easter
the Resurrection of Our Lord  This has been true from the foundation
of the world  Pagan practices are then either

 foreshadowings of the True Celebration of the Resurrection 
   in which dim light was shone forth so that people would
   recognize the full truth when it was manifested OR

 satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not
   recognize the truth when it was manifested

I don't believe the second argument because I believe in the power
of the Resurrection the fulfillment of the Incarnation and our hope
Earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of
the truth of the Resurrection  As Paul states we see through a glass
darkly  So do others  It serves no purpose arguing about who has
the darker or lighter glass  The foreshadowings are not perfect
So what Our understnding of God is today imperfect for we are not
yet perfected  Theosis is not a gift such that WHAM we're perfect

There are all kinds of people in every group and I take offense at
intolerance  It's awfully hard to tolerate such people   OOPS I've
gone over my smiley quota already and it's only the second paragraph  
IMHO they should follow the commandment to love thy neighbor and leave
the judging up to GOD  

SPECIFICALLY
one's sexual orientation is part of one's self
love the sinner hate the sin DOES NOT APPLY

Pay attention fundaligionists  Love your neighbor wether you like it
or not  I'd be happy to get flamed endlessly and loose scripture
quotation contests galore to defend this point  I beleive this is
correct 

BTW Love the sinner hate the sin is a slippery slope with hatred at the

No free gifts of meaning I never quite understood how any
God can just give your life meaning actually If he
says you exists to do or be X that gives you a purpose
if you care to accept it but is that the same thing But
I digress 

I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can
manufacture for ourselves  Little in the cosmic sense  Even the
greatest of the great pharos are long gone the pyramids historical
oddities being worn down by the wind eventually to be turned into dust
Mankind itself will one day perish  Without some interconnectedness
that transcends the physical without God it is all pointless in the
end  Most people are able to live with that and for them little
purposes success money power effecting change helping others
suffice  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale or are at
least able to put it out of their minds

To me it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion  That the
true reality underneath the the physical is spirit  That this world is
a school of sorts where we learn and grow and our souls mature  That
gives a purpose to my little purposes and takes some of the pressure
off  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms
if you're really just here to learn  It's more important to progress
grow persist to learn to love yourself and others and to express your
love especially when it's dificult to do so  Honest effort is rewarded
by God he knows our limitations

 Not honoring our wives can cause our prayers to be hindered
         prayers may not be hindered  I Peter 

One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin 
of physically abusing one's wife  The husband is usually physically 
stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her  
He must honor her as his sister in Christ  This would therefore be an 
example of a specific sin that blocks prayer
Jayne Kulikauskas jaynemmaltguildorg

I would be a bit more specific in looking at this verse in regard to
'blocking' prayer  I have trouble thinking that God would allow
anything to block our access to him in prayer especially if we have
sinned and are praying for forgivenenss
    I can see however how our prayer life might be hindered by our
sin if we are concentrating on what is causing the sin or what has
happened we may not be thinking about prayer thus our prayers are
'hindered' by our own actions
    But I don't think anything can 'block' the transmission or
reception of prayer to God

If there is no why and we spend our lives searching then we have merely
wasted our lives which were meaningless anyway If there is a why and we
don't search for it then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives
Suppose the universe is  billion years old and suppose it lasts another
 billion years Suppose I live to be  That is nothing that is so small
that it is scary So by searching for the why along with my friends here
on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared

What if you woke up at a party with no memory and everyone was discussing
who the host might be There might not be a host you say I say let's go
find him the party's going to be over sometime maybe he'll let us stay

Because we recognize our own mortality we have to find the why

 
 Well then Buddhism Confucianism Taoism Hinduism Judaism
      Zoerasterism Shintoism and Islam should fit this bit of logic
      quite nicely   All have depth all have enduring values
      thus all must be true

This is a good point But more of a good point for studying religion
than ignoring it Some Christians disagree with me but it is worthwhile
to study different religions and philosophies and glean the truth from
them To quote of course out of context Test everything and keep what is
true

In a previous article mhsulonestarutsaedu Melinda  Hsu says


Well the argument usually stops right there  In the end
aren't we all just kids groping for the truth  If so do we have
the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as
false


If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong
then I don't have a belief This is simply what belief means Where does
the authority for a belief come from Nowhere for a belief is itself
authoratative If I produce authority for a belief where will I find
authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority In short 
the mind has to start somewhere By the way the majority of Christians
ie Catholics believe in the authority of the Church and derive the
authority of the Bible from its acceptance by the Church

 Say for example there are people living on a volcanic island and a group 
 of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent They warn the people on 
 the island that they are in danger and should leave A group of people on 
 the island is given the task of warning others of the danger
 
 They believe the danger is real but others may not 
 
 Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning 
 others of the danger Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs 
 are correct and all others are false

But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a
nonexistent danger  Analogies can only push an argument so far on both
sides  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your
respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise

The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from
Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right
and duty to tell the TRUTH to all  

Christians can get offended if others do not believe what is selfevidently
to them the TRUTH Nonchristians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get
offended at them because they christians claim to know the TRUTH

BTW this argument goes for anyone I am not just bagging christians

Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their
mind  As Melinda pointed out there is no point in arguing along these lines
because both approach from a different premise  A more useful line of
discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths

Personally I don't mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine
and we can all live peacefully

      Life to me is definitely NOT meaningless it has precisely the
purpose and meaning I choose to give it I go on living because I like
living if I needed any further reason I'd be free  completely free 
to pick any reason that suited me That freedom can be almost
intoxicating it's probably the closest I've ever been to a 'religious'

 I feel so sorry for Eric and 
 yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as 
 further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity    

      Not unless in explaining your own subjective experience you also
try to convert him or proselytize Merely explaining the effects you
personally experience religion as having on you is not infectious
Not unless Eric is paranoid that is

I have no such 'emptiness' or 'hole' Maybe some others do I wouldn't
know but I don't and if I did I'd seek help about it Doesn't sound
like a mentally healthy situation at all walking around with a 'hole'

 Thank you Eric for your post  It has helped me to appreciate how much

Greetings

Probably a tired old horse but  maybe with a slightly different
twist  I wanted to know if there are any good Englishlanguage texts
for learning ancient Hebrew and how these compare with German
educational texts qualitywise if anybody has an idea  I can't figure
out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to
the US

Something I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the
fact that the students get their ancient languagelearning out of the
way early I'm not a theology student but I spend a lot of time with
such folks in their careers  They take the first two years or so to just
do Greek and Latin and Hebrew possibly Aramaic toowho knows
What's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States  Is
there a lot of language instruction done  I really don't have a basis
for comparison

Regards Phil

For better of worse we don't have the tradition of classical
education in the US so generally if a seminary believes students
should know Greek they have to teach it  It's common for seminaries
to require at least a semester each of Hebrew and Greek though of
course more is required for serious scholarship  clh

 Fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of
 questions that can never be reduced away by natural science  For
 example why does the universe exist at all  
 
Must there be a why to this  I ask because of what you also
     assume about God namely that He just exists with no why
     to His existence  So the question is reversed Why can't
     we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to
     just exist  Why must there be a why to the universe
remainder of message deleted

Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message 

The reason we can say God just exists and can't say The universe just 
exists is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural 
laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular  That is we 
observe in nature that every cause has an effect and every effect was produced 
by a cause  The existence of the natural realm as an effect itself cannot be 
its own cause it must therefore have a supernatural cause

God on the other hand is a supernatural being and is therefore not subject 
to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect  As a supernatural being 
God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence 
of a physical natural cosmos does  Thus those who believe in the 
supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused 
phenomena such as the eternal God whereas those who deny the existence of the 
supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very 
nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence

This is of course an oversimplification of a complex topic but I just wanted 
to clarify some important differences between the supernatural God and the 
natural the universe since you seem to mistake them as being 
interchangeable

  I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and
 quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true This I am trying
 to rectify by reading the Bible of course but it would be helpful
 to also read a good interpretationcommentary on the Bible or other
 relevant aspects of the Christian faith One of my questions I would
 like to ask is  Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological
 works intended for a lay person

I won't even recommend books from my congregation  What you ask sounds
attractive but it is dangerous  As a new Christian you don't want to be
contaminated with other people's interpretation  Steep your self in
scripture and discuss with other christians  Read if your must but
remember that what other people write is their interpretation  God has
promised to give you light so ask for it

 I have another question I would like to ask I am not yet affiliated
 with any one congregation Aside from matters of taste what criteria
 should one use in choosing a church I don't really know the difference
 between the various Protestant denominations


Don't wait too long before attaching yourself to church  Just remember to
always compare what they teach you with scripture like the Bereans did

LISTOWNER I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately Post it only
if you think it of general interest

Here is a copy of something I wrote for another list You may
find it relevant

A listmember asks

  What makes commonlaw marriages wrong

A commonlaw marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself There is
nothing in the Bible Old or New Testament about getting married by
a preacher or by a priest Jewish or Christian And in fact Jewish
priests have never had any connection with weddings

There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the
clergyman In fact the traditional Christian view at least in the
West is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage
and that the clergyman is there only as a witness

HOWEVER

The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment Two
persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound
themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife
forsaking all others till death do them part

      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who
is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public
ceremony is in order that society and the couple themselves may be
clear about whether a commitment has been made

Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony the standard vows
etc Instead we have a man and a woman settling down to live
together
      After a year or so the man says to the woman Hey honey it
was great while it lasted but I think it's time to move on
      She says What are you talking about
      He says I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and
younger
      She says But you can't We are married
      He says What are you talking about We never got married
      She says I remember distinctly what you said to me the night
we first made love You said My love for you is as deep as the
ocean as eternal as the stars As long as I live I am yours
utterly and completely When I lie on my deathbed my last feeble
breath will utter your name My
      He says Oh that That was just rhetoric Just poetry When a
man is in a romantic mood he is bound to say all kinds of silly
things like that You mustn't take them literally

And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is
a matter of public record
      The Church insists on it because it is her duty among other
things to give moral advice and you cannot give a man moral advice
about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married
to whom if anybody and vice versa
      The State insists on it since the state has a concern with
property rights with child care and support and therefore needs to
know who has made what commitments to whom
      Prospective fathersinlaw insist on it because they don't
want their daughters seduced and abandoned
      Prospective spouses insist on it because they want to make
sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment
or just poetry
      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them
formally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their own
minds about what it is that they are doing and may know themselves
that this is not just rhetoric This is the real thing

      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the
marriage commitment  The Church goes further and insists that when
Christians marry a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and
record the vows on behalf of the Church not because it is
impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman but in order
to make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching
about marriage is and that they are in fact promising to be married
in a Christian sense The Church also prefers a standard marriage
vow and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows for much
the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they
draw up a will or a contract Certain language has been repeatedly
used in wills and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it
Try to say the same thing in your own words and you may find that
the probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you
intended  Similarly the Church prefers to avoid endless debates
about whether You are my main squeeze and I am here for the long
haul do in fact cover the same territory as forsaking all others
and till death do us part

      This topic has come up on the list before Is there any topic
that hasn't One listmember was asking If a couple love each
other and are living together isn't that marriage in the eyes of
God Eventually someone asked In that case what is their status
if they break up Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce
Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk
out on  The original questioner said Good grief I never thought
of that In fact there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that
someone who says We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in
front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each
other is trying to have it both ways  to have the advantages of
marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of
bother

At this point someone may say None of this applies to me and my
mate We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong
commitment 'for better or worse forsaking all others till death
us do part' So in our case no ceremony is needed
     To this my reply would be The reason for requiring a driver's
license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road  What is wrong in
itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers but the existence
of dangerous drivers However testing and licensing drivers is an
obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the
number of dangerous drivers on the road Therefore the State rightly
makes and enforces such laws and you the citizen have a positive
moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter
how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are

Back to the original question We have a listmember who knows a
couple who have been living together for around  years He asks
At what point did they stop fornicating and start being married I
answer at the point if any where they both definitely and
explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other for
better or worse as long as they both lived If they have accepted
such an obligation what are their reasons for not being willing to
declare it in front of say a justice of the peace

 Yours

conservative or liberal Protestant or Catholic

TheLostYearsofJesus documentary evidence for Jesus'  year
journey to the East by Elizabeth Clare Prophet  Supposedly this
is a theory that was refuted in the past and she has reexamined it

I thought this was just another novel book but I saw it listed as
a text for a class in religious studies here  Also the endorsements seem
to come from some credible sources so I'm wondering if scholars have
reviewed it or anyone on the net for that matter

	A new Christian wrote that he was new to the faith and 
learning about it by reading the Bible of course I am not
at all sure this is the best path to follow
	While the Bible is for Christians the word of God the 
revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this
revalation is the Church I am not recommending any one
denommination but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian
congregation in which to develop your faith rather than just
reading the Bible
	This does not mean that the Bible should not be read although
I would stick to the Gospels epistles and Psalms and avoid the
Book of Revelation altogether until you are with friends you are
comfortable with I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to
read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable
lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus or for the really
sturdy somewhere in Chronicles
	The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith
of Christians but does not provide the totality of that faith Vital
beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned 
the Trinity the duality of natures in Christ types of Church
organization All these beliefs and practices have developed from the
lived experience of the Christian people an experience lived one
hopes in the Spirit As such the Bible I think is better studies
in the context of a congregation and the context of other reading
	Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine I 
would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the
christian life Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing
the nature of good and evil in the human heart My own induction into
the christian faith was brought about after grace through reading
Graham Greene The Power and the Glory and the poetry of Gerard
Manley Hopkins I would also recommend Graham Greene's Monsignor
Quixote and any novel by Iris Murdoch The last is not even a Christian
but such is her insistence on the need for the good life that frankly
I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after
reading many parts of the Bible And that after all is what being
a Christian is all about letting your soul and your life be in
some way directed towards the infinite represented to us by
the person of Jesus Christ

In article Aprathosrutgersedu heathathenacsugaedu Terrance Heath writes
That is not necessarily unorthodox  When Christians call God 'Father' 
we are using a metaphor  The Bible in one place refers to God as being
like a mother  God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal
sense God has some of the attributes of both the father metaphor is
usually used because for most people at most times it is the less
misleading of the two possibilities

I don't know which passage you are refering to but the passage I have
often seen cited as an example of a mother image of God is Isaiah 
Can a woman forget her sucking child  that she should have no 
compassion  on the son of her womb  Even these may forget  
yet I will not forget you 
 
This passage is not a mother image of God at all The mother here
is the image of the best human constancy can show and it is 
contrasted with the constancy of God The mother figure here represents
mankind not God

Larry L Overacker writes responding to Simon

   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the
   net  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in
   schism or legitimately excommunicated  But that's really beside
   the point  What does the Roman Catholic church say
   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication as
   provided for in canon law

Here's some of the theology involved for the interested

There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's schism often the
basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between

 true obedience
 false obedience
 disobedience
 schism

Take the various classifications of obedience first  There are 
important elements involved here for my purposes

 a command
 the response made to the command

As far as the command goes commands can be LEGITIMATE such as the
Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays  Or they can be
ILLEGITIMATE such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god
Dagon when every other full moon comes around

As far as the response to a command goes it can be to REFUSE to do
what is commanded or to COMPLY

Making a table there are thus  possibilites

command         response            name

LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience
ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience
LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience
ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience

So now you see where my  classifications of obedience come from

Obedience is not solely a matter of compliancerefusal  The nature of
the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to
consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are
obedient or disobedient  You also have to take into consideration
whether the commands are good or bad

In my example if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god
Dagon and they all refuse they aren't being disobedient at all

As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes they are certainly
refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires  But that
alone is insufficient to allow one to label them disobedient  You
also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires

And there's the rub SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been
commanding certain very bad things for the Church  The Popes have of
course disagreed

So where are we  Are we in another Arian heresy complete with weak
Popes  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers  Well the only
way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the
traditional teaching of the Church is

The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of
what is really going on and what the issues are  The religion of
American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth  You
will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press
in this country  On the other hand one Italian Catholic magazine I
get   Days  has had interviews with the Superior General of the
Society of Saint Pius X

Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope  There is some
soundness in this because the Papacy is infallible so eventually
some Pope will straighten all this out  But on the other hand
there is also unsoundness in this in that in the short term the
Popes may indeed be wrong and such Catholics are doing nothing to
help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong  In fact if
the situation is grave enough they sin in obeying him  At the very
least they're wasting a great opportunity because they are failing
to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this
badly

Schism let's move on to schism  What is it

Schism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate
command  All schismatics are disobedient  But it's a superset so
it doesn't work the other way around not all disobeyers are
schismatics  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with
the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics

So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a
schism  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics

You must add this the rejection of the right to command  Look in any
decent reference on Catholic theology and that's what you'll find
the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to
command

Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says for example

     not every disobedience is a schism in order to possess this
    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands
    of superiors denial of their Divine right to command
    from the CE article Schism

Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic  The answer is a clear
no they say that the Pope is their boss  They pray for him every
day  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes

What all this boils down to is this if we leave aside the
consideration of the exact nature of their objections their position
is a legitimate one as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and
schism goes  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they
think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of
the Papacy and the best interests of the Church  In fact someone
who finds himself in this situation has a duty to resist

Now what is the stance of Rome on all this  Well if you read the
Holy Father's motu proprio Ecclesia Dei you can find out  It's the
definitive document on the subject  A motu proprio is a specifically
Papal act  It's not the product of a Roman congregation a letter
that the Pope has possibly never even read  It's from the Pope
himself  His boss is God there's no one else to complain to

In this document the Holy Father says among other things

 The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre
constituted a schismatic act

 Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature
of Tradtion

Both are confusing I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points

As far as the episcopal consecrations go I read an interesting
article in a translation of the Italian magazine Si Si No No  It
all gets back to the question of jurisdiction  If episcopal
consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction then they
would truly constitute a schismatic act justifying excommunication
under the current code of canon law  But my problem with this is
this according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders episcopal
consecration does not confer jurisdiction  It only confers the power
of Order the ability to confect the Sacraments  Jurisdiction must be
conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the
Pope  The Society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite
well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over
anyone  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop

The Si Si No No article was interesting in that it posited that the
reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel
postVatican II idea of Holy Orders  According to this idea
episcopal consecration does confer jurisdiction  I lent the article
to a friend unfortunately so can't tell you more  I believe they
quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea

The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me
There's no way there is a schism according to traditional Catholic
theology  So why does the Pope think this

As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes here's
the passage in question

    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete
    and contradictory notion of Tradtion  Incomplete because it does
    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of
    Tradition which as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught

        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the
        help of the Holy Spirit  There is a growth in insight into
        the realities and words that are being passed on  This comes
        about in various ways  It comes through the contemplation and
        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts
        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which
        they experience  And it comes from the preaching of those who
        have received along with their right of succession in the
        espiscopate the sure charism of truth

    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which
    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the
    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops  It is impossible to
    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond
    with him to whom in the person of the Apostle Peter Christ
    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church

    Papal motu proprio Ecclesia Dei  July 

It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can
be simplified to the following

 Vatican Council II has happened
 I am the Pope

The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that
Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong because he disagrees with them
This is weak to say the least

It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed
Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail  What is John Paul II's
stand on the social Kingship of Christ as taught by Gregory XVI Pius
IX Leo XIII Pius XI and Pius XII for example  Are we supposed to
ignore what all these Popes said on the subject

I don't know what the future will hold but the powers that be in the
SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out



Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey
justified disobedience or even obeying God rather than man
Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in
Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean

Similarly schism indicates a formal break in the church  If the Pope
says that a schism exists it seems to me that by definition it
exists  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break
that there is no good reason for the break to exist and that it will
shortly be healed  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist

It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing
you are trying to reform the power of the papacy  What good will it
do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future but in
the process you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church
discipline  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his
powers and excommunicated someone wrongly  It's something else to
say that his excommunication did not take effect and the schism is
all in his imagination  That means that acts of church discipline are
not legal tools but acts whose validity is open to debate  Generally
it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope
While they have often objected to church sanctions generally they
have admitted that the sanctions exist  You are now opening the door
to people simply ignoring papal decisions claiming to be truly
obeying by disobeying and to be in communion while excommunicated
This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command
that you say defines schism

I heard the Gregorian chant of the Passion on Good Friday  In this

In case you couldn't tell I get extremely angry and upset when
I see things like this  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and
phobias we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other
socially unacceptable diseases  Whether they got the disease through
their own actions or not is irrelevant  They still need Jesus

Aaron Bryce Cardenas writes
The first issue you bring up is your anger  It is obviously wrong to
be angry Gal  for any reason especially extremely angry
which is on par with hatred  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us
for putting him on the cross with our sin yet his prayer was forgive
them Father they know not what they do  

I don't know why it is so obvious  We are not speaking of acts of the 
flesh  We are just speaking of emotions  Emotions are not of themselves
moral or immoral good or bad  Emotions just are  The first step is
not to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that
we hide our true feelings it is to accept ourselves as we are as God
accepts us  It seems that Paul's anger he has accepted and channeled
it to a plea to all of us to refrain from passing judgement on those
afflicted with a disease and to reach out to others  Give in  Calling
his arguments foolish belittling them to only quarrels avoiding action
because of fear to give others a bad feeling he's not forgiving

Rethink it Aaron  Don't be quick to judge  He has forgiven those with
AIDS he has dealt with and taken responsibility for his feelings and made
appropriate choices for action on such feelings  He has not given in to
his anger

                Young's Literal Translation I have also never heard

I believe that these just follow standard reference works

                The authors from which denomination etc of the

Some are by Larry Pierce Brethren some are by Baptists and I
think that Thompson of chain reference fame was Presbyterian

                The realiability of the Treasury of Scripture

Another standard reference work that has been around for decades
A new version was just released and is available through Christian

                Who are the commentators Scofield and BW Johnson
who wrote the Scofield Reference Bible and the People's New Testament respectively 

CI Scofield was the creator of the Scofield Reference Bible  For many

How is a scriptural Levitical priesthood resumed  Are there any Jews who 
can legitimately prove their Levite bloodline

If I am not mistaken the Jewish family names Cohen Kahn etc
are considered to be legitimate indicators of descent from Aaron
The family names Levi Levene etc are considered to be legitimate
indicators of descent from Levi The main legal issue is the purification

of the red heifer last used for this purpose  years ago

same  Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives

real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at  But 

	So you think it is easy to be a Muslim Or be a Buddhist
The Buddha's commandments are  yrs older than Christ's and in
my opinion tougher to follow Moreover the Buddha says that we are 
intrinsically good as against Christ's we are all sinners
 Only we allow ourselves to be distracted By meditating we can awaken 
ourselves etc etc Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism 
In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist
But to awaken yourself is no easy task Can you stay away from eating meat
Can you sit still and think of nothing meditate for sometime everyday
Buddhists do or are supposed to Can you pray five times a day 
Can you fast for a month every year Ramzan Are you willing
to give  th of your income as tithe Muslims do In fact I think 
Jesus was an ordinary man just as Buddha and Mohamed probably with a 
philosopy ahead of the times where he lived 
Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion
compared to Hindiusm Judaism Zorasterism Buddihsm it is also very
probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas
There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the
middle east at the time of Christ
And perhaps some more But leave the crap in it out woman was created
after man to be his helper etc

just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes

 This may be unfair to Lewis  The most prominent fallacy attributed
 to him is the liar lunatic and lord  As quoted by many

Exactly 

C S Lewis has taken a couple of pretty severe hits in this group lately
First somebody was accusing him of being selfrighteous and unconvincing
Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him As well
as by Josh McDowell about whom I have no comment having never read his
work

Anyone who thinks that C S Lewis was selfrighteous ought to read his
introduction to The Problem of Pain which is his theodicy In it he
explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously Why Although he
believed in the argument he was presenting he did not want to seem to
presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own
suffering He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself
as some kind of model of fortitude or that he was anything other than what
he considered himself to be  a great coward 

OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be
embarrassed by Lewis' liarlunaticlord argument which by the way is
part of a much bigger discourse I would just like to add that far from
being embarrassed by Lewis I am in a state of continual amazement at the
soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents

This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this 
doctrine


                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD


I   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD
     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture this is the most
     important  The Bible is preeminently a revelation of God 
     Therefore our first objective in studying the Bible should
     be to know God
     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three
     Persons in the Godhead Trinity  God the Father God the
     Sonthe Lord Jesus Christ and God the Holy Spirit  I
     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in
     nature meaning that They are identical in nature each
     possessing the same divine attributes  They are also
     equally worthy of our worship our trust and our obedience
     Cf Matt  Cor John 

II  THE ATTRIBUTES or CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GODHEAD
     A  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for
         Himself Jehovah  He is the living God eternal and
         unchanging  He is without beginning and without
         ending  Cf Isa
     B  God is a spirit  Cf John 
     C  God is love  Cf  John 
         As such He is gracious merciful good faithful
         patient and full of lovingkindness  Cf Psa 
         Psa  Nahum 
     D  But God is also holy and righteous  He is absolutely
         without sin in His nature and so is incapable of
         sinning in though word or action  Cf Ex  Isa
         
     E  God is omnipresent everywhere present at the same time
         in the completeness of His Person omniscient all
         knowing knowing all thingsthe end from the beginning
         infinitely wise omnipotent almighty sovereign with
         unlimited power over all creation
         God is infinite in His presence wisdom and power  It
         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day
         has become very mancentered and that the people in our
         churches know very little about God  I believe that the
         Lord's work needs to be Godcentered and that the
         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign
         in all things  in the affairs of nations in the lives
         of all people and in the carrying out of His purposes
         regarding salvation

III     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD
     A  In creation
          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in
          creating and all Three are active in sustaining
          creation and in ordering the course of human affairs
          for nations as well as individual people to the end
          of time  Cf Gen  John  Col 
          Heb 
     B  In salvation
         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is
         absolutely necessary to begin with God not with man 
         All three Persons of the Godhead have been and are
         active in salvation
           God the Father
             Salvation originated with God  The Members of the
             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would
             be salvation the conditions under which people
             could and would be saved and even who would be
             saved  Election to salvation is recognized in
             Scripture as the work of  God the Father  Cf Eph
               Thess 
           Christ the Son of God
             The Lord Jesus Christ through His birth by the
             virgin Mary came to the earth to accomplish two
             important works
             a   He came as the final and complete revelation of
                  God the Father  Cf Col  heb 
             b   He came to provide salvation for all whom the
                  Father had chosen  He did this by His death on
                  the Cross by His bodily resurrection and by
                  His present intercessory work in heaven  The
                  work of salvation will be completed for us when
                  the Lord returns  Cf Rom   Cor 
                   Heb   John 
           The Holy Spirit
             As the Author of Scripture the theme of which is
             Christ and His redemptive work the Holy Spirit is
             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the
             following ways
             a   He convicts of sin Cf John 
             b   He regenerates known in the Bible as the new
                  birth  Cf John 
             c   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work
                  of sanctification  Cf John 
             d   He seals every believer in Christ thus making 
                  salvation secure  Cf Eph 
             e   He baptizes every believer into the body of
                  Christ  Cf Cor 
             f   He teaches every believer the truth of

 Who exactly is The Lord  God or Jesus Christ

John  says NKJV  the little green gideon someone forced on me one day
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was 
God  The Word refers to Jesus Christ so from this John declares that God
and Jesus are one  Therefore The Lord refers to both  Also David in the
Psalms refers to both God in heaven and the coming messiah as his Lord  Once
again this refers to God and Jesus

 What is the definition of a Truly religious person Should heshe not 
   swearcurse  Does it say anything about this in the bible

Some of the most truly religious people I've known have not been Christians
and some of the greatest Christians I've known have been truly irreligious
However to answer your question
The bible speaks of this in many places A previous post to James is a good
one  Another is Psalm 
Lord who may abide in your tabernacle  Who may dwell in your holy hill  He
who walks uprightly and works righteousness and speaks the truth in his heart
He who does not backbite with his tongue nor does evil to his neighbor nor
does he take up a reproach against his friend I whose eyes a vile person is
despised but he honors those who fear the Lord he who swears to his own hurt
and does not change He who does not put out money at usury nor does he take
a bribe aginst the innocent  He who does these things shall never be moved

I must have missed the postings about Waco David Koresh and the Second
Coming  How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing unless the
person claiming to be IT is obviously insane

I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ  How could
somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming  Koresh did promise that
he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio
broadcast  He didn't  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people

And from my meagre knowledge of the Bible it seems that Christians have
been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting
somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah

So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be
early to recognize the Second Coming while at the same time not wanting to
be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God

Mark    And then if any one says to you 'Look here is the Christ' 
or 'Look there he is' do not believe it 
Mark    False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and 
wonders to lead astray if possible the elect 
Mark    But take heed I have told you all things beforehand 
Mark     But in those days after that tribulation the sun will be 
darkened and the moon will not give its light 
Mark    and the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers in 
the heavens will be shaken 
Mark    And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with 
great power and glory 

My understanding of Jesus' answer is that unlike his first coming
which was veiled the second coming will be quite unmistakeable  He's
telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen
before his second coming  the actual second coming will make his
power openly visible

By the way from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me
that he is claiming to be Christ

Pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup  I would describe myself as
an agnostic in so far as I'm sure there is no single universal
supreme being but if there is one and it is just we will surely be
judged on whether we lived good lives striving to achieve that
goodness that is within the power of each of us  Now the
complication is that one of my best friends has become very
fundamentalist  That would normally be a nonissue with me but he
feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me which I guess it is
according to his faith  This is a great strain to our friendship  I
would have no problem if the subject didn't come up but when it does
the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us he is offended
because I call into question his bedrock beliefs I am offended by
what I feel is a subscription to superstition rationalized by such
circular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in
the Bible that it is so'  So my question is how can I convince him
that this is a subject better left undiscussed so we can preserve
what is in all areas other than religious beliefs a great
friendship  How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he
won't try  Thanks for any advice

  I'm concerned about a recent posting about WBTSIL  I thought they'd
pretty much been denounced as a rightwing organization involved in

In an earlier article I explained that what many people find arrogant about
Christians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their
beliefs and doctrines  That is many Christians insist that they CANNOT have
made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs which amounts to saying
that they are infallible

Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant most of us will
probably agree

In short the problem is that no matter how good your sources are if any
part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning
then those doctrines are suspect  So long as your own brain is involved
there is a possibility for error  I summarised the problem by writing There
is no way out of the loop


Someone called REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop but
he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase
Sartre ramble about Wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument
leads to relativism

As I have explained to him before you cannot reject an argument as false
because you dislike where it leads the facts do not change just because
you dislike them  REXLEX' wrote

  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is
 taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair

However as any firstyear philosophy student can explain what REXLEX' has
written does not constitute a refutation  All he has said is that he does
not like what I wrote  he has done nothing at all to dispute it

 

There were two sentences in REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the
point at hand

  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real it can be
 experienced and it is verifiable

I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience  I
have for example direct experience of adding numbers  I don't claim to
be infallible at it  in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly  but I
do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers

However once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about
them we are on much shakier ground  That was the point of the earlier
article  Human brains are infested with sin and they can only be trusted
in very limited circumstances


  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute
 about a thing

But how far does that get you  Once God's revelation stops and your own
reasoning begins possibility for error appears

For example let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a
perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper and that Jesus said
exactly This is my body

We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely
true  What can we be certain of  Not much

At the moment he stops speaking and people start interpreting the
possibility of error appears  Did he mean that literally or not  We do
not have any record that he elaborated on the words  Was he thinking of
Tran or Con substatiation   He didn't say  We interpret this passage
using our brains we think and reason and draw conclusions  But we know
that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us wrong  This
is something that most of us have direct experience of  

Why should anyone believe that his reasoning  which he knows to be
fallible  can lead him to perfect conclusions

So given the assumptions in this example what we can be certain of is
that Jesus said This is my body  Beyond that once we start making up
doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed we
get into trouble

Unless you are infallible there are very few things you can be certain
of  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking they
cannot be certain



That is the problem of seeming arrogant  The nonChristians around us know
that human beings make mistakes just as surely as we know it  They do not
believe we are infallible any more than we do

When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead
them astray  when we implicitly claim that we are infallible  the non
Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim  Witnessing is
hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you
are either too foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying
to cover them up

I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what
things we are only very confident of  For example we might say that we
know our sin for recognising sin is something we directly experience  But
other things whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extraBiblical
thinking should not be labled as infallible we should say that we are
very confident of them and be ready to explain our reasoning

But so far as I am aware none of us is infallible  speaking or acting
as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous

 

REXLEX' suggested that people read He is There and He is Not Silent by
Francis Schaeffer  I didn't think very highly of it but I think that
Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians  Somebody
else might like it though so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it

If someone is interested in my opinion I'd suggest On Certainty by
Ludwig Wittgenstein

All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point
pretty clear  anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or
Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really
sola scriptura  Otherwise they are following a law put into effect by
the Church and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of
the Chruch to do so

Andy Byler

You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church
establishing or changing a law  The argument against the Sabbath is
that it is part of the ceremonial law and like the rest of the
ceremonial law is not binding on Christians  This argument is based
on Paul's letters Acts and in a more general sense Jesus'
teachings  Further most people argue that Scripture shows worship
occuring on Sunday and Paul endorsing it  I understand that these
points are disputed and do not want to go around the dispute one more
time  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are
right but that the backing they claim is Scripture

Accepting the principle of sola scriptura does not commit us to
obeying the entire Jewish Law  Acts  and Paul's letters are quite
clear on that  I think even the SDA's accept it  The disagreement is
on where the Bible would have us place the line

By the way Protestants do give authority to the church in matters
that are not dictated by God  That's why churches are free to
determine their own liturgies church polity etc  If you accept that
the Sabbath is not binding on Christians then the day of worship
falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or
since worship is by its nature a group activity churches are free to
decide

C S Lewis's essay THE WEIGHT OF GLORY deals with this question I
recommend it enthusiastically You might also read the chapter on
Heaven in his book THE PROBLEM OF PAIN He gives a fictional
treatment in his book THE GREAT DIVORCE I have found all of these
very helpful

You might also be helped by the treatment in Dante's DIVINE COMEDY
Heaven occupies the last third of the poem but I cannot imagine
reading it other than from the beginning I urge you to use the

I appreciated the followups and replies to my earlier query  One reply which
I have lost suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses one 
of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan  By coincidence last week's
America the national Jesuit magazine carried an interview with Fr Myles 
Bourke Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus  Fr Bourke also directed the NT 
translation in the New American Bible  He noted certain practices have 
been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality 
and sometimes of hilarity has trivialized the liturgy  I note that at my 
parents' parish on Easter helium filled balloons were distributed at the 
offertory apparently to aid in understanding the word risen  This was not a 
kiddie mass either but the wellattended  Mass

I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies  This newsgroup as a
whole offers generally moderate perhaps because it's moderated conversation
on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior including myself
Sometimes people do go over the top but the remarkable thing is how that is
the exception I think  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted  It seems

In article Aprgenevarutgersedu parkinEngSunCOM writes

desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah  If
the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this
cup pass from him  Was this out of weakness  NEVER  Many men and
women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes
Is Jesus less than these  No he is not  He knew the crucification
was NOT the will of GOD  God's will was that the Jewish people accept
Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on
the earth with Jesus as it's head Just like the Jewish people
expected If this had happened  years ago can you imagine what
	
	
	

Why do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father to let this cup
pass from Him was merely a plea to escape death  When I look at
Jesus in the garden I see a ManGod who all His life had had the
presense of His Father with Him  As a result He knew every
detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden  But
as that hour approached He felt abandoned by His Father His
presense diminishing with each passing minute  In addition it
was brought more and more to Jesus's attention the betrayal of
Judas was probably a big impact that His suffering would be to no
avail for many people especially those who would reject Him not
only then but in the future  I truly believe that the majority of
Jesus's suffering was mental and spiritual while the physical
portion was only the tip of the iceburg

BTW we know from John's account that Jesus shunned becomming an earthly
king  From John

JOH     After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did they
            began to say Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the
            world
JOH     Jesus knowing that they intended to come and make him king by
            force withdrew again to a mountain by himself

This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an
earthly king  No Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all Jew 
Gentile people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those
who would believe  This was utterly mistaken much to Jesus's
dismay as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom  But He knew
what His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the
darkness of His Passion

 he and his wife go on tours singing witnessing and spreading the
 gospel for Christ  I may be wrong about Black Sabbath but I know he
 was in a similar band if it wasn't that particular group
 

Jeff Fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for Black Sabbath
He was never ever a musician in the band  He was in St Louis several
months back  The poster I saw at the Christian bookstore I frequent
really turned me off  It was addressed to all Homosexuals prostitutes
drug addicts alcoholics and headbangers or something like that

Well if I showed up with my long hair and black leather jacket I
would have felt a little prejudged  As a Orthodox Christian and
a headbanger I was slightly insulted at being lumped together with
drug addicts and alcoholics  Oh yes I suppose since I drink a good

could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something

There was no note  I do not know if it was

	 someone's idea of an innocent joke that went awry
	 someone's sick idea of flirting
	 an act of emotional terrorism that worked

I dreaded coming back to work today  What if my boss comes in to ask
me some kind of question I don't know the answer so I take a military
specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer and out
falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep  I generally have a
Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration what if I open it up to
Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love
Association  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff

I can lock up my desk but I can't lock up every book I have in the
office  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my
briefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to
find such a picture or a threat or a raunchy note about what someone
wants to do to my body

To make it worse the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to
treat our marvelous secretary to lunch  The appointed hour for
leaving was   I was working in another building but wanted to go
to the lunch  So I returned at  only to find that ever single
person had already left for lunch  They left at  or so  No one
could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my
number was posted  So I came back to a department that looked like a
neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor  This despite
the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being
left in my desk drawer

I need some prayers  I can't stop crying I am so deeply wounded
that it's ridiculous

I feel like I'm some kind of subhuman piece of garbage for people to
reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act  I feel
like I'm a subhuman piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple
phone call saying We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so
that Bob can get back for a big  meeting

Please pray that my resentments will either go away or be miraculously
turned into something positive  Please pray that whoever is torturing
me so will stop and find some healing for him or herself Please pray
for my being healed from this latest wound which falls on top of a
whole slew of other wounds  Please pray that I can find a new job
in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such
harrassment from happening in the first place and swiftly acts
appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions This
company in my opinion has pretty words about how sexual harrassment
isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it how is it that one
female engineer can be touched inappropriately left obsene or
threatening notes left obscene pictures spoken to lewdly etc seven
times in eight years in the same place  Pretty words from the company
do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault

And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this
That's my bad habit ignore it and it will go away you're not worth
anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this you're right
you are a subhuman piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this
way you are just an object you prostitute your mind to this
company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as
well what makes you think women aren't just possessions and
nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act
This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major
depressive episode please pray that these thoughts don't come into
my head and stay there triggering depression

Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God
In a way a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to
God and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can
separate one mentally from God  I know God doesn't drop me from his
loving hand but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the
hand look down think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding
on to me

Although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup
I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide  For this
reason I hope good Mr Moderator allows me this latest indulgence  After
all he's allowed me the thermometer note and a few other offthewall
topics

Thanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers  Peace to you

In article Aprgenevarutgersedu shellgatellouupsicom Larry L Overacker writes

   You ask where we are  I would echo that question  I'm not trying to be
   contentious  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction
   and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions
   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that
   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time
   This is especially true since Councils of Bishops have basically
   stood by the Pope

The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church  This
is the only thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for his
departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church  If commands
from any authority conflict with Tradition the commands must be
disobeyed

My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major
way  God would never allow a hairsplitting situation to develop it
would be too complex for people to figure out  I don't view the
present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated
Run through a list of what has happened in the last  years in the
Catholic Church and any impartial observer will be aghast

   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is
   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition and also over
   authority and discipline  

The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic
Faith in my opinion  Most Catholics know about zilch about the
Catholic Faith this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring
bishops  It's basically the Reformation part II

There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the
shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the
Catholic hierarchy  I could go on listing shocking things for an
hour probably

Take the situation in Campos Brazil for example  I'm reading a book
on what happened there after Vatican Council II  The bishop Antonio
de CastroMayer never introduced all the changes that followed in the
wake of Vatican II  He kept the traditional Mass the same old
catechisms etc  He made sure the people knew their faith the
Catholic theology of obedience what Modernism was etc  He
innoculated the people against what was coming

Well one day the order came from Rome for his retirement  It came
when the Pope was sick  Bishop de CastroMayer waited until the Pope
recovered then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really
wanted or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence
The Pope confirmed the decision  So the good bishop retired

The injustice that followed was completely incredible  A new bishop
was installed  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de CastroMayer's
clergy from their churches because they refused to celebrate the New
Mass  The new bishop would visit a parish and celebrate a New Mass
The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse  The bishop
was enraged by this  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of
the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church  The
priests would just start building new churches the people were
completely behind them  The old parishes had the New Mass as the
bishop desired  and virtually no parishioners

The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal according to
canon law  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the
traditional Mass because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V
Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass

During all this process the people of Campos not just private
individuals but including civil authorities were constantly sending
petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist
bishop  NOTHING was ever done no help ever arrived from Rome
Eventually  priests were kicked out and about  people

   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this

	 Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms
	 could change and be conformed to those of the Pope assuming that
	 the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX
	 don't jointly make such  choice

   If not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority
   If I adopt the view that I'm NOT wrong I CAN'T be wrong and
   there's NO WAY I'll change my mind YOU must change yours that
   I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me

If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra that would be the end
of the controversy  That process is all very well understood in
Catholic theology and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an
instant nonCatholic

The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in
the Catholic world  If they knew the Faith and what our bishops are
doing they would be shocked

   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the real
   traditional teaching of the Church is  If this were a simple matter
   East and West would not have been separated for over  years

This isn't the case in the Catholic Church  There is a massive body
of traditional teaching  The Popes of the last  years are
especially relevant  There is no question at all what the traditional
doctrine is

   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow
   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term
   I may be wrong here I'm not Roman Catholic 

That's heresy more or less  Although they have done a great job
since the Reformation the last  years have seen so many errors
spread that it's pitiful

Infallibility rests in the Pope and in the Church as a whole  In the
short term a Pope or large sections of the Church can go astray  In
fact that's what usually happens during a major heresy large
sections of the Church go astray  The Pope historically has been
much more reliable  Everything will always come back in the long
run

   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement
   regarding the SSPX situation  Would it be honored  If not how
   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility
   Again I'm not trying to be contentions I'm trying to understand
   Since I'm Orthodox I've got no real vested interest in the outcome
   one way or the other

Yes it would be honored  Infallibility is infallibility  But what
is he going to define  That the New Mass is a better expression of
the Catholic Faith than the old  That sex education in the Catholic
schools is wonderful  That all religions are wonderful except for
that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II

   It does if the command was legitimate  SSPX does not view the
   Pope's commands as legitimate  Why  This is a VERY slippery slope

Not really start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last
 years  Everything is very well spelled out  The West excels at
critical thought remember  That's what Catholic theologians have
been busy at for centuries

I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
couple become married in God's eyes 

Not if they are unwilling to go through a public marriage ceremony
nor if they say they are willing but have not actually done so

Let's distinguish real logistical problems like being stranded on a
desert island from excuses such as waiting for soandso's brother
to come back from being in the army so he can be in the ceremony

I disagree  People marry each other  When they commit fully to each
other as life partners they are married  The ceremony may assist in
emphasizing the depth of such a commitment but is of itself nothing
God knows our hearts  He knows when two have committed themselves to
be one he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully
giving ourselves to another  The way I see it you'd have to be living
together in a marriage for somewhere between  and  years before anyone
knew if a marriage really existed but God knows  I don't think God keeps
a scorebook

Darren  Dr Nancy's Sweetie kilroygbororowanedu writes

Darren In an earlier article I explained that what many people find
Darren arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess
Darren absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines

and

Darren In short the problem is that no matter how good your sources
Darren are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own
Darren thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint  
While reason is a gift from God it is also infected by sin
Yet we do not reject reason entirelyand neither I think 
does Darren  We need reason as Darren himself has pointed
out to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible
But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe
the Word  We need first and foremost faith  For the sinful
mind is hostile to God  It does not submit to God's law
nor can it do so  Romans 

Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation
Sola Scriptura but accepted the necessity of the use
of reason with faith in comprehending that revelation
Yet Luther also said regarding baptism But mad reason
rushes forth and because Baptism is not dazzling like
the works which we do regards it as worthless Large
Catechism Fourth part Baptism  To make matters more
complicated Luther was the sort of theologian that many 
people would describe as an absolutist'  I've seen him 
described as a take no prisoners' theologian

We might conclude given these observations that Luther
was inconsistent or mad  And surely at least some have
come to that conclusion  But it might be useful to
recall that Jesus was also called mad  And Peter felt
compelled to defend himself and the apostles against
a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost  So we as Christians
ought to be careful about rejecting Luther or others 
as mad  Rather we should imitate the Bereans who
examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul
said was true Acts 

The basis for the confidence with which Luther Peter Paul and many
others preached the gospel was not just reason but faith and the Holy
Spirit  This is not faith divorced from reason but a faith that
guides informs and uses reason  The Spirit enables us to know the
truth and to proclaim it boldly  God does not want us to preach the
message that I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead but
rather I know that my redeemer lives  Job   The Christian
does not side with Pilate in saying What is truth but rather
follows Christ who said In fact for this reason I was born and
for this I came into the world to testify to the truth  Everyone on
the side of truth listens to me John 

We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can
know the truth  Jesus said If you hold to my teachings
you are really my disciples  Then you will know the truth
and the truth will set you free John   The Proverbs
urge us Buy the truth and do not sell it Pr 
The Psalmist prayed Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth
Ps   Evidently he believed that the word of truth
was in fact in his mouth'  

Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth
is motivated by selfglorification  But if we present the
truth as the teachings of Scripture revealed by the 
Spirit and not our own invention and if we stand ready
to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture as Luther
did then we are not arrogant but humble  We should humbly
trust in God's promise of truth just as we trust in his
promise of forgiveness

REXLEX It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be 
REXLEX absolute about a thing

Darren But how far does that get you  Once God's revelation stops
Darren and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears

I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings
of Scripture and the products of our own reasoneven when such
reasoning is based on Scripture  However I think I would draw
the line of distinction more reasonably'    and less academically'
than you would

Darren For example let's suppose that our modern Bible translations
Darren include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper
Darren and that Jesus said exactly This is my body

Darren We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and
Darren absolutely true  What can we be certain of  Not much

Darren At the moment he stops speaking and people start
Darren interpreting the possibility of error appears  Did he mean
Darren that literally or not  We do not have any record that he
Darren elaborated on the words  Was he thinking of Tran or Con
Darren substantiation  He didn't say 

Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement
about the Lord's supper  The Lutheran approach is to say
that if Jesus said This is my body then that is what we
should believe  Other interpretations are rejected simply because
they are not taught in Scripture

Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject  We also
have Paul's words in  Corinthians in which he passed on to
us what he received from the Lord  In particular he said For
whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the
Lord's death until he comes  By these words we should believe that
the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread as well as
the Lord's bodyas our senses in fact tell us  Does this prove
that transubstantiation is false  I suppose someone could say that
Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread simply because
that is the way the body appears when we eat it  But this thought is
found nowhere in Scripture  So we reject it  Thus the primary
reason for rejecting transubstantiation is not that we can
prove it false but that it is simply not found in Scripture

side remark
I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is
consubstantiation  But it has been nonLutherans who have told
me this  We tend not to use the word  I almost think that this
is used more by professors of comparative religion who need labels
to compare Catholic Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's
Supper  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching
real presence because that was the traditional teaching of 
the church
end side remark

Darren When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning
Darren can never lead them astray  when we implicitly claim that we
Darren are infallible  the non Christians around us rarely believe
Darren that implicit claim  Witnessing is hardly going to work when
Darren the person you are talking to believes that you are either too
Darren foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying
Darren to cover them up

This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations
in their witnessing  It is far better to take the approach
I'd like to show you what Scripture says  You decide for 
yourself whether to believe it or not

Darren REXLEX' suggested that people read He is There and He is Not
Darren Silent by Francis Schaeffer  I didn't think very highly of
Darren it but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many
Darren Evangelical Christians  Somebody else might like it though
Darren so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it

Darren If someone is interested in my opinion I'd suggest On
Darren Certainty by Ludwig Wittgenstein

As long as we're trading references I'd like to suggest Dr Siegbert
Becker's paperback The Foolishness of God The place of reason
in Lutheran theology published by Northwestern Publishing House
This book was based on Becker's doctoral thesis at the University
of Chicago

 Can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there

 Bjorn

I'd love to know how Jesus only proponents would answer questions like

Who is this Father Jesus keeps referring to Why does He call Himself the
Son

Why does He pray to the Father and not to himself

Why does He emphasize that he does his Father's will and not his own  If He
 was doing his own will what kind of example is that  Should we follow it

When He says he has to return to the Father who is He going to

When He says he does this in order that the Comforter the Holy Spirit might
 come who might that be

If He claims that the coming of the Holy Spirit is such a blessing that it's
 worth His leaving us and returning to the Father what can that mean if there
 is no Holy Spirit

Why doesn't the best known Christian prayer begin Our Saviour who art in
 heaven rather than Our Father

Do they have answers to these questions that are even plausible

Further entertaining queries are left as an exercise to the reader

There may be some misunderstanding over terms here  I believe Jesus
only originally was in the context of baptism  These are folks who
believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only
Jesus rather than Father Son and Holy Spirit  This may have
doctrinal implications but as far as I know it does not mean that
these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father  I'm not the
right one to describe this theology and in fact I think there may be
several including what would classically be called monophysite or
Arian two rather different views as well as some who have beliefs
that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards but who won't
use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply
because it is not Biblical  clh

 Hello all  We are doing a bible study at my college on Revelations  We
 have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable
 interpretation  We are now on chapters  and  which talk about the
 woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon  I believe the beast is the
 Antichrist some may differ but it seems obvious and the woman represents
 Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church  What are some
 views on this interpretation  Is the falling Babylon in chapter  the same
 Babylon in as in chapter   The Catholic church
 Hate to step on toes
 thanks

An interesting interpretation of Revelation  and  has been given by  
evangelist David Wilkerson  I am not saying that I totally agree with his  
interpretation but it is certainly believable and good food for thought  He  
interprets the Babylon of Revelation  as being none other than the good  
old U S of A  That's right America  He supports his claim in several ways   
The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce and the  
WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell  The American dollar despite the Japanese  
success of the th century is STILL the most sought after currency in the  
world  If the US were destroyed wouldn't the whole world mourn  The bible  
also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots sin and adultery I am  
paraphrasing of course  Babylon's sin affected or should I say infected  
the whole world  It doesn't take much looking to see that the US is in a  
state of moral decay  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the do  
it if it feels good mentality all over the world  I think though that what  
Mr Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls  
Babylon Babylon the Great and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  
earth  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country I  
don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the US is STILL the  
most powerful nation on earth

Again this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own but I do find it worthy  
of consideration

Here is another way of looking at it

When we die we are released from the arc of time and able
to comprehend our lives in toto  To visit each moment in
time sequentially or all at once but not able to alter the
actions thoughts or feelings we hadhavewill have in this 
life

From that perspective I posit that all will have direct knowledge
of God and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether
we were doing what we ought  That the experience of having
lived a life far from God will be an eternal torment  That 
having lived a life of grace will be an eternal joy  That the

Hello I'm back

I would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response be
it a positive or negative one I read EVERY letter and thought about 
each one 

I got all sorts of responses from marry her to have nothing ever to 
do with her again

Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer here is what I have
decided to do

I sent her a letter today First i told her that if she was really serious
about moving away from home to another state that I would do anything to 
get you here in NC I told her that I tried to find out if there were 
any new stores planning to be builtbut they wouldn't tell me

About her marraige comment I'm not gonna call it a proposal cause
I still don't know if it was a total joke or not I more or less said
that Marry me Well get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk  

Hopefully what i said could be interpreted either way

Needless to say there has been a lot of praying over thisI 
have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible If
she was dead serious about getting marriedI wouldn't do it
yet simply bc she is not as far as I know to this point a Christian
It just wouldn't work wo God in the marraige as well I figure
that if God wanrs this to go throughhe's kept us in touch for  
years nowhe can handle one more If God wants it to happen it
will happen

She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to 
see herand I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know
more of what to look forward to

I guess all I can do now is wait and pray I have decided not to tell
my folks until I'm totally sure what is going on

I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation
in your prayers

Finally I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in

If you have anything else for meI will be at this email address
for one week Please tell me anyhting you wantI'm curious
how folks think about what i did


Thanx

Chris

Pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup  I would describe myself as
an agnostic in so far as I'm sure there is no single universal
supreme being but if there is one and it is just we will surely be
judged on whether we lived good lives striving to achieve that
goodness that is within the power of each of us  Now the
complication is that one of my best friends has become very
fundamentalist  That would normally be a nonissue with me but he
feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me which I guess it is
according to his faith  This is a great strain to our friendship

Sorry to disappoint you but I'm afraid your friendship is in danger  
Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend you 
are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life  Why 
do you call into question his faith  Your friend has changed he has 
found something that fills a need in his life  You need to decide if 
you are still his friend whether you can accommodate his new life  
It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in 
the Bible yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief 
that it is superstition  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him 
seriously that you at least took an interest in the light he has found 
that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of 
his life you could together decide to become fundamentalists respect 
each others differences and remain friends or part ways  Maybe even if 
you stuck it out with him you could help him to unconvert  Of course 
if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions 
and begin to resent you

I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists because I know
that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing
I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists but I am not
offended by their prosyletizing  I had a few good conversations with
some Witnesses who came to my door  I didn't switch my beliefs but for
those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere
the Witnesses provide a wonderful service  You may have been conditioned
to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious but
why  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them that
you will be swept up in fundamentalism that you will become a weirdo
Friendship's a twoway street  You must respect your friend ALL of him
including his beliefs if you want the friendship to continue

Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read I got it from
a The Morning Star and am posting it with the permission of the
editor


    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga

    The Patron of Youth


    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son the  Prince
    Gonzage  He  wanted  him  to become a famous brave and honoured
    soldier After all he must carry on the  great  family  name  of
    Gonzaga  Of  course he was to become far more famous brave and
    honoured than his father could ever have imagined though not  in
    the manner expected

    Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from
    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the
    life of Our Lord She had little time for the pleasures  of  this
    life  As  Saint  Aloysius	grew he began to resemble his mother
    more than his father

    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's
    soldiers  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar he
    fainted from shock This shows his immense hatred of sin What an
    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin

    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  which  he  received
    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan  Charles Borromeo whom himself
    became a great Saint he consecrated  his  purity  to  God  and
    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life

    He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to	show  his  reciprocal
    love  He  started by denying his passions he avoided eating the
    finest foods wearing the best clothes and would put  pieces  of
    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God
    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  and  his
    younger  brother  to  the court of the Spanish King Phillip 
    Obediently he set out to make the best of it He mixed  in  well
    with  the people of the royal court for he was handsome polite
    intelligent and always had something interesting to say


    Not long before this time the great soldiersaint  Saint	Igna
    tius  of  Loyola  had founded the Society of Jesus the Jesuits
    towards which Saint Aloysius


				  







    began to have a yearning When he finally told  his  father  the
    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest

    After a short time his father sent him to the  great  cities  in
    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood but even

    through these trials Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the
    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity

    The Marquis' plans were obviously failing so he confronted  his
    son  Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish
    ness I will not father was the  inevitable  reply	Then
    leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind
    With tears clouding his eyes the Saint left the  room  to	pray
    Tell  me Lord what am I to do Tell me Tell me He knelt down
    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before  but
    this  time	he was seen The onlooker rushed to the marquis This
    at last brought the proud man to his senses The Lord wants him
    the Lord can have him He gave his consent for his son to become
    a Jesuit

    After some years at the end of the sixteenth century a  terri
    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome All the hospitals were full and
    could house no more so the Jesuits opened their own Saint Aloy
    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals particularly to prepare
    the dying for a holy death

    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from	carrying  and
    nursing  the  sick  For three months he lay with a burning fever
    and finally on June st  he gave his  soul	to  the  Lord
    while gazing at a crucifix

    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his
    humility purity and confidence in prayer

    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga pray for us

     Brendan Arthur






    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of
    others as a sword is to a soldier

God Bless

In a previous article randersoacadsahsuthtmcedu Robert Anderson says

I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
couple become married in God's eyes  Some say that if the two have
publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to God and
are unswervingly committed to one another I realize this is a subjective
qualifier they are marriedjoined in God's sight

I have discussed this with my girlfriend often  I consider myself married
though legally I am not  Neither of us have been with other people sexually
although we have been with each other  We did not have sexual relations
until we decided to marry eventually  For financial and distance reasons
we will not be legally married for another year and a half  Until then
I consider myself married for life in God's eyes  I have faith that we
have a strong relationship and have had for over  years and will be
full of joy when we marry in a church  First however we must find a
church we will be living in a new area when we marry and will need to
find a new church community

Anyway I feel that if two people commit to marriage before God they are
married and are bound by that commitment

There is some controversy in my denomination as to what authority is vested 
in the pastor  I am still forming my opinion  I am solicing opinions and 
references for what that is how much and how it should be used

   As a general reference I would not exclude responses from different 
denominations based on Biblical teachings but you have to understand our 
church is independent protestant and likely to be much different from those 
that follow ecclesiastical authority in the church  We may need to discuss 
the roles of deacons and elders

Thanks for your replies

I have stated before that I do not consider myself an atheist but 
definitely do not believe in the christian god  The recent discussion
about atheists and hell combined with a post to another group to the
effect of 'you will all go to hell' has me interested in the consensus 
as to how a god might judge men  As a catholic I was told that a jew
buddhist etc might go to heaven but obviously some people do not
believe this  Even more see atheists and pagans I assume I would be 
lumped into this category to be hellbound  I know you believe only
god can judge and I do not ask you to just for your opinions

My last article included this quote

 If any substantial number of   talkreligionmisc   readers read some
  Wittgenstein  of the postings would disappear  If they understood
  some Wittgenstein  would disappear   Michael L Siemon

Someone called boundary' wrote
 
 This quote seems a little arrogant don't you think

There is a convention called a smiley' which looks like this     
It is supposed to look like a sideways smileyface and indicates that the
preceding comment is supposed to be funny


And I'll note that I have participated on talkreligionmisc for over
five years  I'd say Mr Siemon was not too far off  

 

In the meat of his reply Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what
I meant by There is no way out of the loop  I wrote that human brains are
infested with sin and can be trusted only in limited circumstances

In reply Mr Boundary wrote

 I would beg to differ with you here  The properlyformed conscience
 can be trusted virtually ALL the time

Which just moves the problem back one level how do you tell if your
conscience is properly formed

The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the
formedness of your own conscience  In other words you can only be sure
that your conscience is properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation
can be trusted  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time I'll
grant but it's not a valid way of reasoning

Unless you are infallible your judgements about your own thinking cannot be
certain  Therefore it is not possible to be certain your conscience is
properly formed'  Whatever that is supposed to mean


Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem

 Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church  It is by necessity the
 infallible interpreter of divine revelation  Without the Church          
 Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects

The Church is by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation
How do you know  Presumably you believe this because of some argument or
another  how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes

You write

 Therefore although our minds are finite and susceptible to error our
 competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our
 ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true even in areas
 not subject to the experimental method 

But there is a huge difference between confidence in our ability to
distinguish what is true from what is not true' and infallible'  I am
confident about a lot of things but absolute certainty is a very long way
from confident'

This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain
really go check the subject line  Saying you are absolutely certain is
significantly different than saying you are confident  When you say that
you are confident that invites people to ask why

Except in very limited circumstances when you say that you are absolutely
certain it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any
idea of his own fallibility


I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowablyinfallible source of
truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning  All of
them  every last one  has claimed that he was himself infallible
The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on


Darren F Provine  kilroygbororowanedu

This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the
original criticism  I get the feeling that the original poster
regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong
answers in religion and that the difference can have eternal
consequences  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is
at least in significant danger of ending up there I will admit that
 as you say  the reasoning processes I used to reach this are
fallible  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong  But these
basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's
unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it  In order to get this level of
confidence I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as
to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues  I haven't for
example said that all nonChristians will definitely end up in hell
and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail  I have a
feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and
intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's
some chance I'm wrong

Don't get me wrong  I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant
Christians and often criticism of us is justified  But in at least
some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger
If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for
certain decisions it's not my fault  I'm just telling it the way I
think it is  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that
way  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most
difficult to respond to  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what
I think is the truth

conditttsdarlututexasedu Paul Conditt wrote


 I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere
 man even if he did claim to be the son of God andor a prophet

I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking  what distinguishes
true religion from cults I'm speaking generally here not specifially
about Christianity  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on 
Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question  Basically he said that
true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person
But then Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity
IS the person of Jesus  So what distinguishes for example the
Branch Davidian cult from the Presbyterian church  Doctrinal
differences don't answer the question IMHO so don't use them as
an answer


As far as I can see one of the big differences between Davidians and
Christians is in who they follow  I have sometimes tried to put myself
in the feet of one of Jesus's disciples  Basically they gave up a
lot  career possibly family and well a whole bunch to follow
Jesus

So what is the difference  It is quite plain  Jesus was good and
David Koresh was not

The problem is I think is that we try to legislate what is good
and what is bad in terms of principles  For instance there are thousands of 
laws in the US governing what is legal and what is not  Often it is hard
to bring people to justice because it is not possible to find
a legal way to do it  If only we could trust judges to be just
then we could tell them to administer justice fairly and justice
would be followed  But since judges don't always get it right
we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches
of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect the justice
of man into something perfect  But what I hear about the justice
system in the US tells me that quite the opposite is true

There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation
more than the material being presented  So we might consider 
a ranting Christian to be bad but an eloquent person from another
religion to be good  This goes along with the American desire
to protect the Constitution at all costs even if it allows
people to do bad things 

I think that it is the message that is important  If a man is
presenting a false message even if he is ever ever so mild mannered
then that man is performing a tremendous disservice

I know that I am rambling here  I guess that what I am trying to
say is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us
why the Davidians got it wrong  It is not wrong to follow and
worship a person  But it is important to choose the right person
It is simple  Choose Jesus and you got it right  Choose
anyone else and you got it wrong  Why  Because Jesus is the
begotten son of God and nobody else is  Jesus was without sin and
nobody else was

Are the governments of the United States and Europe not moving

muslims

CanDoes God use those who are not following him to accomplish

Praise God  I'm writing everyone to inform you that I have been
accepted to the Doctor of Psychology program at Fuller Theological
Seminary in Pasadena CA  I've been working long and hard to try to
get in there and have said many hours of prayer  I'm very excited for
this opportunity but also very nervous about it

I'd appreciate the prayers of the readers of this group for my preparation
for school this summer and for my career as a graduate student  I'd also
appreciate any information any of the readers of this group might have 
about Fuller Pasadena or California in general like good places to
have fun good churches to check out or anything else that might be
good for me to know  Also if anyone knows of any foundations that 
might have funding or scholarship money available please let me know
Of course if you wish to make a personal contribution

The contract for my current job is over at the end of April  I'll be
taking a couple classes at UT this summer and then I'll be moving to
Pasadena  Hopefully I'll be able to get netaccess next fall although
Fuller doesn't have it itself

I've enjoyed the interesting discussions and I commend everyone for their
earnest search to please God  Thanks to our moderator for providing
such a wonderful service and in doing a great job of running this news
group

May God bless you all  Vaya con Dios mi amigas y amigos

I always suspected that I was human too   It is the desire to be like
Christ that often causes christians to be very critical of themselves and
other christians 

I'd like to remind people of the withering of the fig tree and Jesus
driving the money changers et al out of the temple  I think those
were two instances of Christ showing anger as part of His human side

 I have some qualms about postings like this  You might want to
 engage in a bit more conversation with Joel before deluging 
 someone who doesn't expect it with cards  clh

I'd suggest that more than some qualms are in order  Without knowing
anything about the situation it is impossible to evaluate the
appropriateness of writing  Some folks will check others with more
zeal than time may not

IMHO requests of this nature should be made only for oneself or for someone
who knows and approves of the idea  Otherwise it is intrusive and
disrespectful of the individual

In a prior article lmvecwestminsteracuk William Hargreaves writes

 Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do
 as taught in Romans but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
 in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spatout'

If you agree that good works have a role somewhere you will 
generally find yourself in one of two camps 

    Faith  Works  Salvation
or  Faith  Salvation  Works

Either  works are required for salvation or  faith will 
inevitably result in good works 

I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone based on
Ephesians  and Romans   I also conclude that James  when 
read in context is teaching bullet  above When James speaks of 
justification I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring
the believing sinner innocent in His sight Paul's use of the word 
Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being 
justified or proven by the display of good works Also according 
to James  the abscence of such works is evidence for a dead or 
useless faith which fails to save

James  is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it
is teaching   Works would have their place not as merit toward 
salvation but as evidence of true faith

If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong
then I don't have a belief This is simply what belief means

Unfortunatly this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when
it comes to their religion Some take it to the extreme and say that
their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings
then you won't be saved It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim
to know what God thinkswants Especially when it's based upon your
interpretation of a book The logic in the above statement is faulty
in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be
correct It's all about perception No two people are exactly alike
No two people perceive everything in the same way I believe that
there is one truth Call it God's truth a universal truth or call it
what you will I don't believe God presents this truth I think it is
just there and it's up to you to look for and see it through prayer
meditation inspir ation dreams or whatever Just because people may
perceive this truth differently it doesn't mean one is wrong and the
other is right As an example take the question Is the glass half
empty or half full You can have two different answers which are
contradictory and yet both are correct So for your belief to be
true does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong

If a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that God
will save only Christians it's hard to see how you can criticize them
for arrogance for saying so  It could be that they're wrong  But I
hardly see that it's arrogance  Let's look at this a bit closer
Suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taught
us things but didn't say anything about exclusivity  If we believe
them and then add and anybody who believes anything else is damned
then you could well criticize us for arrogance  But in this case the
exclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets etc  So
we could be wrong in believing it but I don't see how we can be
called arrogant  Maybe the world isn't a soft place  Maybe certain
choices actually do have eternal consequences  I can see calling the
Christian message arrogant in a certain sense though only in the
same sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because it
doesn't give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off a
building  But not Christians for passing it on given that they
believe it  The complaints I can see making are  that Christians
are wrong or  that God is arrogant  clh

following Christ  From Captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict
obedience to the Gensis command to subdue the earth to Nazi's who have
justly punished the Jews for the killing Christ

It is funny how this one little quote from Genesis is treated
by certain antiChristians as if Christians have been given a
firm command to destroy the earth You could prove almost
anything by taking little quotes out of context from the Bible
 it's a big book you know I doubt you could find a single
case of a antiecological action taking place specifically
because teh perpetrator was motivated by a Christian belief

As for the Nazis they were motivated by German Nationalism
not by Christianity In fact they despised Christianity as a
weak pacifist religion and were much more keen on pagan
glorification of strength and warfare They killed the Jews
because they were not Germans not because they were
Christkillers  they were just as keen on killing the other
nonGerman ethnic minority the Romanies or Gypsies

Bob Van Cleef writes

   If the Papacy is infallible and this is a matter of faith then the 
   Pope cannot be wrong  If on the other hand this is not a matter 
   of faith but a matter of Church law then we should still obey as the
   Pope is the legal head of the church

   In other words given the doctrine of infallibility we have no choice
   but to obey

This is a primary problem in the Church today  What you are saying is
more or less heresy  You might call it infallibilism  It's the
idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does
This is virtually all over the place especially in this country

The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and
welldefined conditions  When these conditions are not met he can
make mistakes  He can make big mistakes

A couple historical examples come to mind

Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the
English Catholic Church  At one point during his career the reigning
Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see  Bishop
Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body though
maybe not in so many words you have to treat Popes with respect even
when they are wrong  The problem was that this nephew would just
collect the income of the see and probably never set foot there
This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd  Bishop
Grosseteste was quite right in what he did

Another example is that of Pope John XXII a Pope of the Middle Ages
He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific
Vision until the Last Judgement  He decided that this should be a
defined doctrine of the Church  Though he didn't quite get around to
defining it  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic
doctrine  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church
He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail even  In
the end he had to admit his mistake  Shortly before he died he
recanted  His successor made the exact opposite idea a dogma of the
Church

If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such
subjects such as St Robert Bellarmine a Doctor of the Church you
will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall
into heresy or schism

The teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Pope
must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith
A Pope's authority is given for the purpose of building up the
Catholic Church  Commands in conflict with this purpose have no
legal or moral force

A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood 
transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are 
Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood 
transfusion The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood 
transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as 
Christians could be perceived to be arrogant

The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary 
to save the life of the child is irrelevant here What matters is that the 
doctor BELIEVES it to be true and could be seen to be trying to foce his 
beliefs on the parents and this could well be perceived as arrogance

Let me carry that a step further  Most doctors would not claim to be 
infallible  Indeed they would generally admit that they could conceivably
be wrong eg that in this case a blood tranfusion might not turn out to 
be necessary after all  However the doctors would have enough confidence
and conviction to claim out of genuine concern that is IS necessary  As
fallible human beings they must acknowledge the possibility that they are
wrong  However they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable
and stand by their convictions

 Hi everyone 
 	   I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem  I 
 know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our 
 deeds yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless 
 saying' You fools do you still think that just believing is enough' 
 
 Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by 
 themselves and not by God according to Romans that person is still 
 saved by there faith

my   Yes and No  I do not believe the above scenario is not possible  
Either they are believing and living in at least some part led by God else 
they are not  Believing intellectually but waiting is not enough
   Especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are 
so committed nor can you judge someone else  I guess the closest we can 
come to know someone's situation is listening to their own statements  This 
can be fallible as is our sense of communion one with another

 But then there is the bit which says that God 
 preferes someone who is cold to him ie doesn't know him  condemned 
 so a lukewarm Christian someone who knows and believes in God but doesn'
 t make any attempt to live by the bible 

Regarding this passage we need to remember that this is a letter to a church 
at Laodicea people who are Of the Body of Christ Rev  He talks 
about their works  A translation could say that he says their lack of 
concern makes him sick to the point of throwing up

 Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what 
 you do as taught in Romans but how can I square up in my mind the 
 teachings of James in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being '
 spatout'
   Right saving is by faith alone except that faith does not come alone if 
you catch the two meanings
   I can offer the explanation that Jesus would that we were either on fire 
for Him or so cold we knew we were not in His will and thus could be made 
aware of our separation  This is admonishment for His children not eternal 
damnation

Please define cell church  I missed it somewhere in the past when this
was brought up before

In a cell church the fundamental building block is the cell group  a
small group of no more than  believers  The small groups are responsible
for the ministry of the church evangelism and discipleship  The emphasis
is on relationships not on programs and both the evangelism and the
discipling are relationshipbased

This will probably raise more questions than it answered but that's it in
a nutshell

  randy


Very interesting but I also believe that you have presented a
misleading argument  Christianity is not the cause of the massacres
and horrific injustices that you relate rather they are the fault
of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message and modify
it to suit their own beliefs and aims rather than alter their
ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in
the New Testament  With every truthful and good message that
carries authority or implied authority comes the inevitable
fact that some many people will understand it in a distorted
way with inevitable consequences

The Bible's message is that we are to love all people and
that all people are redeemable  It preaches a message of
repentance and of giving  Unfortunately all people have
deceitful hearts and are capable of turning this message
around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways
This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine

One of the problems is that you look at the world through
the eyes of Western history  I think that you will find
many many cases of massacres that were instigated by
people who never claimed they were Christian  I am not saying
this to justify the massacres that were but I am merely
pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already

Consider the world without Christianity  I doubt that we
would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we
live if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ
Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion
I won't name any here though one comes to mind which
would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such
subjects

Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for
power greed and hatred  Please don't point the blame at
a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial in
love for others

Yours in Christ

Andrew McVeigh


ps I believe that a line of questioning like you presented
is strangely enough compatible with becoming a Christian
Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour
of the world and especially Christians  I praise God for
Jesus Christ and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs
and still come back to God and be forgiven time and time
again

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on
the biblical text  Luke's account is highly suspect I would refer you to
the hermeneia commentary on Acts  Moreover Luke's account is written at
least  years after the fact  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died
and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up
with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established
Moreover Pauls account of some of the events in Acts as recorded in 
Galatians fail to establish the acts accounts 

Even if there was no independent proof that Luke's account was
valid I find it strange that you would take the negation of it as
truth without any direct historical evidence at least that you've
mentioned to back it up  The assertion was made unequivocally
that no Christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in
the Resurrection  Luke's account suggests otherwise and in the
absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken
then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect

I think the original claim may have been somewhat more limited than
this  It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn't
be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs
Thus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered
for believing in the Resurrection  Rather the issue is whether
those who witnessed it did

I do agree that the posting you're responding to shows that there
can be liberal as well as conservative dogmatism

the different nonbiblical argument those who oppose the Sabbath present 

One question comes to mind especially since my last one was not answered
from Scripture  Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response

There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial 
Answer this

Since the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical
basis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion is ceremonial
OR You say that the seventhday is the Sabbath but not applicable to
Gentile Christians  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been
annulled  References please

If God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable to
Gentile Christians why did He make it plain that the Gentiles were now
grafted into the commonwealth of Israel

Acts  Rom  Col  Gal   I believe we've gotten into
a loop at this point  This is one of those classic situations where
both sides think they have clear Scriptural support and there's no
obvious argument that is going to change anybody's mind  I don't think
we're going anything but repeating ourselves  clh

In article Aprathosrutgersedu oserfermiwustledu Scott Oser writes

And the two simplest refutations are these

  What impact  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament
I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate and that
the recorded impact actually happened  I find it interesting that no other
contemporary source records an eclipse an earthquake a temple curtain
being torn etc  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection
is from the Pauline epistles none of which were written sooner than  years
after the supposed event

First off I'd say that the impact if right before your eyes  That we are
even discussing this is a major impact in and of itself Further the early
church bears testimony to the impact

  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no
one knew where it was  I personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen by disciples or by graverobbers
Don't bother with the point about the guards  it only appears in one
gospel and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make
up in order to counter the graverobbing charge  The New Testament does
record that Jews believed the body had been stolen  If there were really
guards they could not have effectively made this claim as they did

Of course they knew where it was Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both
the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker Pilate was no fool and didn't 
need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to 
make it appear He had arisen Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a 
man well know to the Sanhedrin to say that they didn't know where He was
buried begs the question

Now you say that you think that the disciples stole the body But think on
this a moment Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a 
deliberate lie If not then why do you think the disciples would Now I'm
not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth 
but unbeknown to you it is a lie Many have done this No I'm talking about
dying by beheading stoning crucifixion etc for something you know to
be a lie Thus you position with regards to the disciples stealing the 
body seems rather lightweight to me

As for graverobbers why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over 
the body of Jesus He wasn't buried with great riches So again this is
an argument that can be discounted

That leaves you back on square one What happened to the body

and the one typically suggested by sceptics who are knowledgeable

empty tomb stories are a result of accounts growing in the telling

    That would depend on what Heaven is like If God is a King and 
an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King
I might opt for Hell I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to

But then on the other hand if you really loved that King more
than you did yourself and He loved you to the point of assuring
you that the eternal time spent with him would be eternal ecstasy
would you really opt for that choice

 Suppose you were part of the Christian consipracy' which was going to  
 tell people that Christ had risen  Never mind the stoning the being  
 burned alive the possible crucifixion  let's just talk about a  
 scourging  The whip that would be used would have broken pottery metal  

No one was ever flogged beaten burned fed to the lions or killed in any
other way because of a belief in the resurrection  sorry to disappoint you

I think you are vastly oversimplifying things We know that early Christians
suffered totures because of their witness to Christ  For example

ACT     His speech persuaded them They called the apostles in and had
            them flogged Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of
            Jesus and let them go

ACT     The apostles left the Sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been
            counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name

It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion
to even hearing Jesus's name
ACT     We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name he said
            Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are
            determined to make us guilty of this man's blood

Finally the first apostle's death James of Zebedee was certainly
not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen 


The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different
forms in the religions of antiquity  The problem was not the resurrection
which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population 

The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection then one
must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He
stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth  That would
have been extremely difficult for some people especially those
that had plotted to kill Him

In article Aprathosrutgersedu aafreenetcarletonca Mark Baker writes
 To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence is to deny
 God's existence since neither science nor reason can in their very
 nature prove anything

Are you asking us to believe blindly  You are trying to deny that part of
us that makes us ask the question Does God exist ie selfawareness and
reason  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant
as the other animals on this earth  Does God want us to be like that

I am asking you to believe in things not visible I don't know if this is
believeing blindly or not I'm not sure how blindness comes into it I do
not deny reason indeed I insist upon it but reason only draws conclusions
from evidence If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on
the evidence of the five physical senses then you cut reason off from any
possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere beyond the
rather provocative if inconclusive conclusion that the physical sphere
is not self explanatory 

Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence 
which they call faith and which is a gift of God That is this evidence
is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself The 
evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists Reasoning
on the evidence of the senses won't help either But Christians do reason
of the evidence of faith and do claim that this evidence is wholly
consistent with the evidence of the other senses and indeed that the
evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself
to us

It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come
through this route There may be other senses than the physical ones
providing evidence of nonphysical realities There may of course be
physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses for
all we know These senses if they exist may provide valid evidence for
reason to work on And as with all senses these senses may be impaired
in some people that is they may be spiritually blind In this sense
belief in God becomes an act of sight and it is disbelief which is blind

You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything  However if
we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone  And since
we can only use faith why is one picture of God eg Hinduism any less
valid than another eg Christianity

Faith as I have said is not opposed to reason it is simply a new source 
of evidence on which reason may operate It is clear that human beings
have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses and
similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by
faith Religious believers in general and Christians in particular use
reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding
of the evidence provided by faith Science claims with good reason to be
the most valid system for explaining the physical universe and Christianity
claims also with good reason to be the most valid system possessed of the
best evidence for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man

If you doubt that Christians use reason read this newsgroup for a while
and you will see rational debate aplenty

Someone writing anonymously asks

 Would you have become a Christian if you had not
 been indoctrinated by your parents You probably never learned about
 any other religion to make a comparative study And therefore I claim
 you are brain washed

I did become a Christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents and
having studied Buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser
degree  I made a decision to accept the truthclaims of Christianity after
having given it a lot of thought  I have to point out that the process was not
purely a cold rational one there was a powerful experiential element as well
Also my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the
responsibility for the outcome my conversion on anyone but God

It took me years and years for this all to happen because I had many of the
objections that this poster puts forward  I grew up in the shadow of generic
authoritarian conservative denomination and I knew that that wasn't a way
of life that I could adopt  But I gradually learned not to tar all of
Christianity with the same brush and realized quite suddenly one cold winter
night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected  I am quite certain that
I was not brainwashed

Phil Sells writes

 Probably a tired old horse but  maybe with a slightly different
 twist  I wanted to know if there are any good Englishlanguage texts
 for learning ancient Hebrew and how these compare with German
 educational texts qualitywise if anybody has an idea  I can't figure
 out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to
 the US

My impression is that for advanced work you will be much better off with
German reference works lexicons concordances especially  For a firsttime
encounter my personal preference would be to deal with a textbook written in
my native language  But if you know German and are in Germany pick up all the
reference books you think you can handle  I only know these works by
reputation since my German is most rusty but I'd look at the following books
Koehler's lexicon Mandeldern's concordance the Jenni  Westermann theological
dictionary of the OT

 What's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States  Is
 there a lot of language instruction done  I really don't have a basis
 for comparison

The amount of language instruction available at US seminaries varies widely
mostly depending on the denominational heritage of the school  Presbyterian
and Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical
languages than others  Of course any divinity school that has a doctoral
program in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources  But
there are quite a few mastersdegreegranting seminaries here at which the
attitude seems to be more Well if you're really interested we'll give you
a semesterlong course but we don't understand why   

The pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for firstyear
students to take intensive fiveweek introductory language courses in each
language followed by semesterlong exegesis courses  That is Hebrew in
August OT exegesis in the fall Greek in January NT exegesis in the spring 
These courses are required for graduation a third or a half of the students
I'd say take advanced biblical work that requires language work

I think it was Lewis who said that in a wedding it's the principals  
that marry each other the church and the state are present merely as  
witnesses

This is not just Lewis  it's a summary of standard Catholic
theology  However this doesn't mean that the presence of those
witnesses is optional except in odd situations like the standard
desert island  clh

	I originally wrote to the person who asked this question
personally but decided to post the information I had on the topic

	I spoke to the pastor of my parish Catholic recently 
by coincidence on this subject  His explaination was that 
while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence
of a priest it is important to have it recognized by the 
Church as soon as it is possible  Because the Church 
recoginizes itself as a community of believers members
of the church to some degree are to be held accountable
to each other  To be less hypothetical than that mythical
couple on the desert island there are many places in the
world that do not have priests availible for marriages
on a regular basis  Therefore couples get married without
the priest being present but get the priest to testify to
their marriage when one comes through the area  

	I remember a religion teacher in high school saying
that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple
as much as it is for the benefit of the community  Thus
married couples have some responsibility to the community
to stay married as divorce sets a bad example for the
community  Also the couple has vowed to become one with
one anotherthe community should be able to rely on that 
couple to be as one

	While couples may marry without witnesses they 
may NOT get anulments without a priest present  An 
anulment is simply an admission of the church that what
they had declared a marriage was not in fact a marriage
at all for whatever reason  So don't start getting married
in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves
anulments a halfhour later

	I tend to agree with the response back there that
said couples become married as soon as they consumate their
marriage but I would add that couples should consider their
marriage consumated if they have sex whether or not they
intended to be married assuming they were both willing
partners to the sexual act  The couple must be prepared
to raise any children they may have as a result of that
sexual act with the benefit of both parents  Sex IS a
commitment I believe in God's eyes

	But I'm digressing

			God be with you

        My family has never been particularly religious  singing Christmas
carols is about the limit for them Thus I've never really believed in God and
heaven although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either 
I'm sort of undecided probably like a lot of people I guess
        Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more and I wondered how
religious people can be so convinced that there is a God I feel as though
I want to believe but I'm not used to believing things without proof 
just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God so I can't
definitely believe that there is I wondered if most of you were brought up by
religious families and never believed any different Can anyone help me to
understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong

        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is
correct How do you choose a religion and how do you know that the Christian
God exists and the Gods of other religions don't How do you feel about
people who follow other religions How about atheists And people like me 
agnostics I suppose Do you respect their religion and accept their
beliefs as just as valid as your own Isn't there contradiction between
the religions How can your religion be more valid than any others Do
you have less respect for someone if they're not religious or if they follow
a different religion than you would if they were Christian

        Also how much of the scriptures are correct Are all events in
the bible really supposed to have happened or are they just supposed to be
stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave

        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas which I suppose are
fairly universal throughout all religions  not killing stealing etc and
'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression The only part I find
hard is the actual belief in God

        Finally what is God's attitude to people like me who don't quite
believe in Him but are generally fairly 'good' people Surely not
believing doesn't make me a worse person If not I find myself wondering why
I so strongly want to really believe and to find a religion

        Sorry if I waffled on a bit  I was just writing ideas as they came
into my head I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too

I wrote in response to dlecointgarnetacnsfsuedu DariusLecointe

It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ  I
think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another Rom  is
probably all that needs to be said

Was Paul a God too Is an interpretation of the words of Paul of higher
priority than the direct word of Jesus in Matt Paul begins
Romans  with If someone is weak in the faith  Do you count
yourself as one who is weak in the faith

I accept that Darius is doing
what he does in honor of the Lord  I just wish he might equally
accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing
their best to honor the Lord

Yes but what does the Bible have to say What did Jesus say Paul
closes Romans  with On the other hand the person with doubts about
something who eats it anyway is guilty because he isn't acting on his
faith and any failure to act on faith is a sin Gaus ISBN
Have you read the Ten Commandments which are a portion of the Law Have
you read Jesus' word in Matt Is there any doubt in your mind
about what is right and what is sin Greek hamartia  missing the mark

However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous
proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day  As I
indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited

Whereas the Ten Commandments and Jesus' words in Matt are fairly
clear are they not

The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually
about something else  They both look like they are talking about
nnregular Christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they
gathered every Sunday for worship  We get various pieces of
information but nothing aimed at answering this question  

Matt doesn't answer your question

what day Christians met in their houses  Acts  despite Darius'
confusion is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday   It doesn't
say they gathered to
see Paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread

Breaking bread  roughly synonymous with eating

So I think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day
of every week simply means every time they gather for worship  

How do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and
Jesus's word in Matt

I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements
is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian
worship was
clh

Or they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus' word in
Matt actually stood for something Perhaps they were strong in
the faith



No I don't believe that Paul can overrule God  However Paul was
writing for a largely Gentile audience  The Law was regarded by Jews
at the time and now as binding on Jews but not on Gentiles  There
are rules that were binding on all human beings the socalled Noachic
laws but they are quite minimal  The issue that the Church had to
face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to
follow Christ  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say
that the Law was abolished  It simply acknowledged that fact that it
didn't apply to Gentiles  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 
As far as I can tell both Paul and other Jewish Christians did
continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath  Thus they
continued to obey the Law  The issue was and is with Gentile
Christians who are not covered by the Law or at least not by the
ceremonial aspects of it

Jesus dealt mostly with Jews  I think we can reasonably assume that
Mat  was directed to a Jewish audience  He did interact with
Gentiles a few times eg the centurion whose slave was healed and a
couple of others  The terms used to describe the centurion see Luke
 suggest that he was a Godfearer ie a Gentile who followed
God but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law  He was commended by
Jewish elders as a worthy person and Jesus accepted him as such
This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view
that Gentiles need not accept the Law

However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on
the Law  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law we
have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law and
how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law  At least as I
read Paul he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a
certain sense superceded  Again this issue isn't one of the
abolition of the Law  In the middle of his discussion Paul notes
that he might be understood this way and assures us that that's not
what he intends to say  Rather he sees the Law as primarily being
present to convict people of their sinfulness  But ultimately it's an
impossible standard and one that has been superceded by Christ
Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here and not everyone
agrees with my reading  But the interesting thing to notice is that
even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law
It still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota
or dot may be removed  For its purpose of convicting of sin it's
important that it not be relaxed  However for Christians it's not
the end  ultimately we live in faith not Law

While the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the
end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion  The
quoted passage from Mat  should be taken in the context of the rest
of the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus shows us how he interprets the
Law  The not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading
but in fact that's not Jesus' approach  Jesus' interpretations
emphasize the intent of the Law and stay away from the ceremonial
details  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude
towards the Sabbath and kosher laws  Some scholars claim that Mat
 needs to be taken in the context of st Cent Jewish
discussions  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a
tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that
really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and
plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who
use them are full of extortion and rapacity  Mat  This and
the discussion later in Mat  suggest that Jesus has a very specific
view of the Law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the
Law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of it
Paul's conclusion is similar  While he talks about the Law being
superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the
ceremonial law such as circumcision and the Sabbath  He is quite
concerned about maintaining moral standards

The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being
superceded and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained I believe
they are talking about different aspects of the Law  Paul is
embroiled in arguments about circumcision  As is natural in letters
responding to specific situations he's looking at the aspect of the
Law that is currently causing trouble the Law as specifically Jewish
ceremonies  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards
of conduct  On the other hand when Jesus commends the Law he seems
to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and
human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
to give Paul so much trouble

It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways but
we should be familiar with that from current conflicts  Look at the
way terms like family values take on special meaning from the
current context  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to
figure out why family values should be used as a code word for
opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the US  I
think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was
involved in  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values
that go along with the term Law any more than people who concerned
about the family values movement are really opposed to family
values

Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope  There is some
soundness in this because the Papacy is infallible so eventually
some Pope will straighten all this out  But on the other hand
there is also unsoundness in this in that in the short term the
Popes may indeed be wrong and such Catholics are doing nothing to
help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong  In fact if
the situation is grave enough they sin in obeying him  At the very
least they're wasting a great opportunity because they are failing
to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this
badly

Joe

Your logic excapes me 

If the Papacy is infallible and this is a matter of faith then the 
Pope cannot be wrong  If on the other hand this is not a matter 
of faith but a matter of Church law then we should still obey as the
Pope is the legal head of the church

In other words given the doctrine of infallibility we have no choice
but to obey

You might want to look at the FAQ on infallibility  The doctrine on
infallibility does not say that the pope is always right  All
Catholic theologians acknowledge that there have been a number of
occasions when the pope was wrong  There appear to be two aspects to
infallibility  One is a general concept that in the long run the
Church is protected from serious error  However this does not mean
that it's impossible for it to take wrong turns at one time or
another  The more specific concept of papal infallibility is that in
very specific circumstances a papal statement can be known to be
infallible  However a relatively small fraction of statements meet
those criteria  This does not absolve Catholics from the duty to obey
even ordinary teachings of the pope  However only a few teachings
are made in a way that is explicitly infallible  clh

  For example why does the universe exist at all

 I find this view of Christianity to be quite disheartening and sad
The idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a Creator

 And the logic is also appalling God must exist because I want Him to

 I have heard this line of reasoning before and wonder how prevalent
it is Certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is
hopeless or so the pollsters and newscasts state but I don't see
where this is a good reason to become religious If you want 'meaning'
why not just join a cult such as in Waco The leaders will give you

Hi I am a Sociology student and I am currently researching into 
young offenders  I am looking at the way various groups of 
children are raised at home  At the moment I am formlulating 
information on discipline within the Christian home

Please if you are a parent in this catagory can you email me 
your response to the following questionaire  All responses 
will be treated confidentially and will only be used to prepare 
stats

  Ages  sexes of children

  Do you spank your kids

  If so how often

  Do you use an implement to spank with 


 If you do not spank what method of discipline do you use

  Your age

  Your location

  While under the age of  did you ever commit a criminal 
offence

  How ere you disciplined as a kid


Thank you in advance for any reply you can make  Please email 
your replies rather than post them on the newsgroup

I hope it is obvious that responses to this question are likely to
have serious problems when used for research purposes  Our readers
are not likely to be a random sample of Christians and this form does
not contain enough information to act as a stratified sample  Perhaps
someone who is familiar with research methods might want to correspond
with him  clh

insert deletion of Paul's and Aaron's discourse on anger ref Galatians


I don't know why it is so obvious  We are not speaking of acts of the 
flesh  We are just speaking of emotions  Emotions are not of themselves
moral or immoral good or bad  Emotions just are  The first step is
not to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that
we hide our true feelings it is to accept ourselves as we are as God
accepts us  

Oh but they definitely can be  Please look at Colossians  and
Ephesians   Emotions can be controlled and God puts very strong
emphasis on selfcontrol otherwise why would he have Paul write to
Timothy so much about making sure to teach selfcontrol 

insert deletion of remainder of paragraph


Rethink it Aaron  Don't be quick to judge  He has forgiven those with
AIDS he has dealt with and taken responsibility for his feelings and made
appropriate choices for action on such feelings  He has not given in to
his anger

Please rethink and reread for yourself Joe  Again the issue is
selfcontrol especially over feelings and actions for our actions stem
from our feelings in many instances  As for God giving in to his anger
that comes very soon

The bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago

take it literally

Please leave heaven out of it  For his own sake I pray that Dan does
take it literally because that's how God intended it to be taken  Dan
your view of many groups appears correct from my point of view
However I have found a group which is truly meeting requirements laid
down by the Bible on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus  I have no
clue where wwc is but please mail me  I'd really like to get you in
touch with them

gone offcenter of Dan's original context

Dan I'm familiar with this one  You've got a point though  There are
some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple some have
no clue about it because they've not been taught some have done exactly
that and turned over everything to follow Jesus some are blocked by
difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law
However Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his
disciple in Luke  and Luke   My question is  why do
people ignore the command and treat it as optional  I certainly don't
have an answer to this

	Parting Question
		Would you have become a Christian if you had not
been indoctrinated by your parents You probably never learned about
any other religion to make a comparative study And therefore I claim
you are brain washed

My parents had nothing to do with it  God had and has everything to do
with it  As for these attacking responses I must say that I disagree
with your tone and what appears to be some very judgmental statements
possibly to the point of slander when talking about people not what
they do  Please if you have a response state it instead of flying off
the handle on some discourse which may have nothing truly to do with
what is being discussed  I'm sure both Dan and I would have a much
happier time with your responses

  This is somewhat long but pleas read it




Boy am i glad you decided to read this I've got a problem that 
I need as many people's help from as possible

Before I go in to the details of this let me go ahead and tell
you that though it may sound it this is not one of those boy
meets girl problemat least not totally like that to meAnyway

OK I am a  year old Sophmore at NCSU About  years ago my family
and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented Across the
street was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me
her name in Erin Well we became friends that week at the beach and have
been writing each other for about  yearsthere was a period of about
 years we lost contactbut that was a while ago 

By the wayErin lives in Kansas and me in NC

OK last year in one of her letters she says that she is coming
back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there So I
drove about  hours to see her This is where it beginsI spent
the whole day with Erinone of the best days of my life Even though
we had been writing each other we still had to get used to being
in personshe has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met
She's one year older than me BTW I mean no person in the world could
ask for a better person Not only was she incredibly beautiful not to 
mention WAY out of my leaguealthough I'm  not unattractive mind you but
she had a great personality and a great sence of humor Her family
is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the
extent of their Christianityyou know the kind of people But she
knows I am a Christian 

Well you get the idea of what I think of her If there is ever such
a thing as love at first sightI found it That was last yearI kid
you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then

In out letters Erin and I always kid each other about not finding
dateswhich is true for me but I know it can't be for her
She has had some problems at home her folks split up and she ended
up leaving schoolNow we are at the present

Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week


Okay now I'm going to try to explain my life to you I'm not
going to KU anymore because something just isn't right College
just wasn't clicking with me here Greek life is really big here and
that just isn't my way I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested
me  i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life I was
interested in something medical Physical Therpy  I love working with 
kids but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university And my parents
could tell

So I'm working full time at the Bass Store Bass shoes that is and now
I have a parttime job at a local daycare I work in the infant room
MWF I've really enjoyed it so far It spices up my week a little bit and 
it's great experience

As of now I'm not planning on going back to school in the very
near future The main reason being my indecision on what I want to
study But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of
years Where I have no ideaexcept for one thing it won't be
to Kansas

Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district 
manager It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for
about  months as Assistant Manager and when that's done I'll 
basically be given a list of stores newly or soon to be built to 
chose where i would like to manage I've pretty much decided on either
one of the Carolinas hopeully close to the beach Wouldn't it
be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years
What do you think abou that I would like to know your opinion

This job would pretty much be temporary But it is VERY GOOD pay
and any thye of management experience would look good on an application
or resume The company is solid and treats it employees very well Good
benefits bonuses  medical plans Plus after  year of fulltime
service they will reimburse tuition I do have school money waitng
for me but this will help especially since I will probably end up 
paying out of state tuition wherever I go

Chris i really would like to know what you think of my decision I 
respect your opinion I've been completely lost for what to do for 
soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really 
good I do like my job although I'm about  sure that i want
to do more with my life than reatil managementbut it IS something
I don't think earning about  a year for a  year old female
is too bad 

Anyway onto your career decisions I'll solve your problem right now
MARRY ME

You can do your pilot thing I like to be by myself sometimes Seriously
or not as seriously do what will make you the happiest worry about the
home life later



OK well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight What do you
think she meant about the marraige thing 

I dream at night about marrying her and then she mentions it in her
letter I don't know what to think

Since she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a 
Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina

I always pick on those people who graduate from high school and
get marriedbut what does she mean 

I've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that 
I don't date beacause  No time   Not that much   that
most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the
Greeks whic as a Christian I can't supportand here
she says she doesn't like the Greek thing either

Maybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am
so attracted to paying some real attention to me

I mean what if she did move to NCwhat would I do I'm
only  and she I'm only a Sophmore struggling through
classes

I have prayed about this over the past year from time to time
saying God if she is the right one let the situation open up

Could this be my sign

I would do ANYTHING to get her to NChere is some moree that makes 
it worse

Should I call her I'm terrible over the phone I don't even like
to talk to my friends here for longer than  minutes

I mean what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very
average guy like me

I'm really confusedI would really appreciate any help i can get

Thanx 

Chris

I have a feeling that it might be more appropriate to talk with
Chris directly via email  clh

It seems I spend a significant amount of my time correcting errors about
the reliability tests for condoms and abstinence  A few years ago I saw
that famous study that showed a  failure rate for condoms  The
same study showed a  failure rate for abstinence  That is adult
couples who relied on abstinence to prevent pregnancy got pregnant in
alarming numbersthey didn't have the willpower to abstain  And we're
thinking that this will work with high school kids

I am told that Planned ParenthoodSIECUSstyle valuesfree methods that
teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make choices
actually increase pregnancy rates I posted a long article on this a while
back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested  The
article included sources to contact for information on research verifying
these statements and an outstanding source for info on acquiring
abstinencerelated curricula even in singlecopy quantities for home use

The same research produced the results that abstinencerelated curricula
were found to decrease pregnancy rates in teens  I assume that it is
reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy
rate

The difference is not in contraceptive technology but in the values taught
to the children  The PPSIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have
legitimate choices while the abstinence related curricula taught them that
they did not have legitimate choices other than abstinence  It is the
values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of
these kids

Despite the better track record of abstinencerelated curricula they are
suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that
desired  

Question for further discussion as they say in the textbooks  Why don't
we teach safe drug use to kids instead of drug abstinence  Isn't it
because we know that a class in how to use drugs safely if you choose to
use drugs would increase drug use  Why isn't drug abstinence education
barred from schools because it teaches religion  Aren't we abandoning
those children who will use drugs anyway and need instruction in their safe
use

 Drugs are a replacement for Christ
Those who have an empty spot in the Godshaped hole in their hearts must 
do something to ease the pain

I have heard this claim quite a few times Does anybody here know
who first came up with the Godshaped hole business

  This is why the most effective 
substanceabuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples' spiritual 
needs

You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim
like this

In step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous one of the steps
involves acknowleding a higher power  AA and other step abuse
recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective

Unfortunately as evidence for God this can be dismissed by stating
that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes 
people 'religious' and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that
being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict but
still maintain that both are escapism  And I suspect that there
are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to
Christianity

I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ
ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves
as incomplete and needing God the 'Godshaped hole' while atheists
necessarily see themselves as selfsufficient  If the atheists are
right Christians are guilty of being morally weak and too cowardly
to stand up for themselves if the Christians are right the atheists
are guilty of considerable arrogance  I use the term atheist to
refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God
as opposed to one who does not know andor does not care about God

This may be a really dumb one but I'll ask it anyways
	Christians know that they can never live up to the requirements of

try to do it  Doesn't it seem like we are spending all of our lives  
trying to reach a goal we can never achieve  I know that we are saved by  
faith and not by works but does that mean that once we are saved we don't  
have to do anything  I think James tells us that Faith without works is  
dead paraphrase  How does this work

So long as we think that good things are what we have to do rather than
what we come to want to do we miss the point The more we love God the
more we come to love what and whom He loves

When I find that what I am doing is not good it is not a sign to try

Hi there netters
I have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on
Is there such a thing as a 'justifible' war 

What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either All war  
is wrong or Some war is justifiable 

To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the  
question In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  
Zealand Cadet Forces This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  
it but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training  
Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying have become involved  
in the sport of gliding and have a great interest in military aviation  
hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for My favourite  
computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft both  
past and present 

I became a Christian about  years ago and at the time rejected all  
military activity as immoral For me all war was in complete opposition  
to God's commandments to love one another especially one's enemies

During the war in Iraq I found myself with great excitement listening to  
the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  
technology I so admire  The FA 'Stealh' bomber the F F and F  
strike aircraft etc After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  
simulations based around this conflict  Great to go and bomb Saddam's  
bioweapons plants in an FA on my computer or shoot down some of his  
Mig's in an F The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  
game I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way  
One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  
of war is ignored A building containing people or an aircraft flown by a  
pilot is simply a 'target' Dead civilians are 'collateral damage' These  
euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  
support are necessary for the continued waging of war  One only has to  
look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is

Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia and  
the prospect of military intervention in the MuslimCroatSerb conflict in  
the former Yugoslavia My revulsion in particular to the siege of  
Sarajevo and in the last few days of sorry 'bout spelling Sebrenitsa  
has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war

I will list several wars in the last  years I can look at each and say  
 Yes this may have been justifible this may not These are simply my gut  
reactions to each  In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  
history brings Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  
my reaction  I am not a historian so excuse any historical blunders I  
am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand

 The Second World War
	 Murder of Jews  Hitler had to be stopped
	 Massive civilian casualties on both sides 
		 Dresden HiroshimaNagasaki
	 Probably justifiable

 Korean war
	 Political expansionism by North Korea basically
	  communism vs capitalism
	 Probably not justifiable

 Vietnam
	 As above worsened by US involvement

 Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia
	 Genocide by Khmer Rouge
	 Probably justifiable

 Iraq Desert Storm
	 Political expansionism threat to world oil supply
	 Other factors such as genocide
	 Not sure but probably justifiable

 A future involvement in Bosnia
	 Genocide  so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'
	 Emotive  much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties
	 Probably justifiable

 Possible future use of nuclear weapons  tactical or strategic  
somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else  eg Libya  
or Israel
	 My feelings in this are simple
	 Nuclear warweapons are abhorrent
	 I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear
	  armed or powered warships from NZ port
	 Never justifiable

These are my own views I have looked at scripture and I am confused I  
would appreciate others view particularly those based on scripture I  
don't want a  Naaahh yer wrong  I think answers 

Thanks for your help

     I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court
System sort of a justice of the peace  I had great difficulty
with that duty  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse
bathroom before the ceremonies mostly asking that the couples
would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and
divine purpose in marriagecouples who obviously didn't realize
that marriage is God's institution not the state's  Gradually
however I came to conclude that because I was acting in a
strictly secular public capacity established as such by both
the state and the expectations of the couples involved I was
really conducting a purely secular legal civil event with no
greater moral or religious implications than if I had been
conducting a civil trial the couple who told me midceremony
to please hurry it up may have helped me to this conclusion 

     I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp
distinction between marriage before God and marriage before
the state until I had to deal with my own divorce  Keeping
Matthew  in mind I felt that the state had no business
dissolving my marriage established before God but of course it
assumed jurisdiction nonetheless  

      I would ask those of you proposing answers to this
question to consider this issue's logical extension If
intercourse or the mental intent of the parties or the
ceremony of the church or any combination thereof establishes
marriage then at what moment is it dissolved

I've been thinking about the idea that was raised by Michael Covington 
I think that words mean what we think they mean regardless of 
etymology  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my 
childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes 

I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word  People who were very 
angry said it  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew  It 
carried connotations of otherness of threat of enemy  It took some 
time to figure out that there was a connection between Christ' and 
Christian'  When I accepted Jesus I expected to be disowned  To 
become a Christian meant to join the enemy  I knew others would 
consider me a traitor  At some level I agreed but was still prepared 
to pay this price  Like Esau I sold my birthright  However I made a 
better bargain  He only got some stew but I got the incomparable 
riches of knowing Christ

As it turned out my parents did not disown me  I found out later that 
they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of  By the time 
they had decided it wasn't a phase they were sort of used to it  They 
didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either  
For example they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church   
When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her 
death she said to me As far as I'm concerned you still are a Jew 
What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me  But I am not a 
Jew  I am a Christian  I'll concede one that likes chicken soup with 
matzoh balls 

I do not keep kosher  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday  My 
sons are not circumcised  But these things are true of some people who 
do consider themselves Jews  It is not these rules that make people 
Jews it is the heritage from the past  I gave up the past

This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews  Their 
experience is unlike mine  They still consider themselves Jews while 
following Jesus  Some would even say that I must do so too  

I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage  
It was not something I valued very much when I gave it  But I did have 
a sense that I was giving it for God  It may have been a small 
sacrifice  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice  But I gave it 
and do not want to ask for it back

And while I don't have the heritage I was born with I do have another  
I am an outcast from the house of Israel but I am a member of the 
Church  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is 
that it is rich in tradition  It gives me a feeling of once again 
being rooted in the past 

This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess 
around with Christian traditions for example changing the name of 
Easter  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine

I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all 
believers of Jewish background are the same  For some Jewish 
Christian' is a good name for others it is an oxymoron

perhaps you can tell your friend that you feel pressured by his
continual discussions of this topic  surely he doesn't feel you
should be pressured into something you feel uncomfortable about
since christianity should be a choice one should make on one's own
please also realize that he is doing this out of friendship  he
probably feels you are missing out on something great and wants to
tell you about it  but since you know where you can learn about
christianity you can tell him that it is now up to you to make that
choice and if the choice is no you should be respected for that
personally i believe that a christian's mission is just to be
christlike showing hisher own faith and happiness in that faith

Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in
general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular  He wrote it around
  The first part of the twopart article was on the scandalous
activities of Archbishop Weakland in this country but I cut all
that  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant

Joe Buehler



Schism and Disobedience

According to St Thomas Aquinas schism consists primarily in a
refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the
Church united to him On first sight it would appear that whatever
the subjective motivation of the Archbishop as discussed above he
must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to
the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of
jurisdiction However standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it
clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of
disobedience are schismatic If this were so as was noted at the
beginning of this article it would mean that the number of American
bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures

The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in
the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de
Theologie Catholique The article is by Father Yves Congar who is
certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre  He explains that schism
and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused Father
Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence
of legitimate authority in the Church for example Luther's rejection
of the papacy Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a
decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not
constitute schism but disobedience  The Catholic Encyclopedia
explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to
intend to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies  It
adds that not every disobedience is schism in order to possess this
character it must include besides the transgression of the command of
the superiors a denial of their divine right to commandNot only
does Mgr Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command
but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and
his intention of never breaking away from Rome The Archbishop made
his attitude clear in the JulyAugust  issue of  Days We pray
for the Pope every day Nothing has changed with the consecrations
last June  We are not sedevacantists We recognize in John Paul II
the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church We don't even say that he
is a heretical Pope We only say that his Modernist actions favor
heresy



Intrinsically Schismatic

The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr Lefebvre is in
schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is
an intrinsically schismatic act A bishop who carries out such a
consecration it is claimed becomes ipso facto a schismatic This is
not true If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it
would always have involved the penalty of excommunication In the 
Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension see
Canon  of the  Code Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to
excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic
church in China The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops
differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr Lefebvre
as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope
that is to deny that he has the right to govern the Church and the
illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise
an apostolic mission Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the
bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of
jurisdiction They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of
ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and
also to perform confirmations I do not wish to minimize in any way
the gravity of the step take by Mgr Lefebvre The consecration of
bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the
ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the
primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman
Pontiff But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the
Church could not be more grave and that grave measures were needed in
response

It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics
that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism and the Vatican
has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression  There is not
so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation The New Code of
Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon  entitled
Penalties for Specific Offenses De Poenis in Singula Dicta The
first part deals with Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the
Church De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem Canon
 deals with the offense of schism which is evidently together
with apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offenses
against the unity of the Church

But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this
canon or indeed under any canon involving an offense against
religion or the unity of the church The canon cited in his
excommunication comes from the third section of Penalties for
Specific Offenses which is entitled Usurpation of Ecclesial
Functions and Offenses in their Exercise De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum
Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis The canon in question is
Canon  which reads A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and
the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a
pontifical mandate incur an automatic latae sententiae
excommunication reserved to the Holy See

The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense
of schism are then contrary to both truth and charity A comparable
smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly
justify legal action for libel involving massive damages An accurate
parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had
been convicted of first degree murder

I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion
of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law Canon lawyers
without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr Lefebvre have repudiated
the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable Father
Patrick Yaldrini Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut
Catholique in Paris noted in the  July  issue of Valeurs
actuelles that as I have just explained Mgr  Lefebvre was not
excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical
function He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which
constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the
illicitly consecrated bishop It is this usurpation of the powers of
the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a
parallel Church

Cardinal Rosalio Lara President of the Pontifical Commission for the
Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law commented on the consecrations
in the  July  issue of la Repubblica It would be hard to
imagine a more authoritative opinion The Cardinal wrote

    The act of consecrating a bishop without a papal mandate is not
    in itself a schismatic act In fact the Code that deals with
    offenses is divided into two sections One deals with offenses
    against religion and the unity of the Church and these are
    apostasy schism and heresy Consecrating a bishop with a
    pontifical mandate is on the contrary an offense against the
    exercise of a specific ministry For example in the case of the
    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh
    Thuc in  and  although the Archbishop was excommunicated
    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because
    there was no intention of a breach with the Church



It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating
bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least
intent of establishing a schismatic church He is not a schismatic and
will never be a schismatic The Archbishop considers correctly that
the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy
and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to
consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society Canon
Law provides for just such a situation and even if one believes that
the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these
consecrations the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it
could not means as Canon Law states clearly that he has not incurred
excommunication Furthermore while the Vatican allows such prelates
as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot
expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a
great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to
the service of the Church and the salvation of souls

Dr Eric M de Saventhem President of the International Una Voce
Association is one of the best informed laymen in the Church and he
knows the Archbishop intimately Dr de Saventhem like myself has no
greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr Lefebvre and
the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime A quotation from a
statement by Dr de Saventhem which was published in the  February
 Remnant merits careful study

    In retrospect the road leading to the consecrations of  June
    appears more paved with grave Roman and unfortunately also
    papal omissions than with Lefebvrist obstinancies And from the
    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to
    present the Archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense
    against the Faith  It is saidtodaythat Mgr Lefebvre has an
    erroneous concept of Tradition If this were so Cardinal
    Ratzinger could not on behalf of the Pope have addressed to the
    Archbishop the following words in his letter of  July 
    Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it
    'the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to
    the Faith of all time the Holy Father understands your concern
    and shares it

  The discussion begins why does the universe exist at all  
 
 One of the Laws of Nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate 
 at least to this layman's mind there must be a causal event  No
 reasonable alternative exists

I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime 
causes precede their effects But if you claim that there must be
an answer to how did the universe our spacetime  emerge from 
nothing science has some good candidates for an answer

I have always wondered why Christians use the There are questions
science or atheism cannot answer argument I hope this is the
appropriate group to ask this question

The most popular question is the question of origins Why does the
universe exist or anything for that matter

I think this question should actually be split into two parts namely

 Why is there existence Why anything exists

and

 How did the universe emerge from nothing

It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question However
is it a meaningful question after all

I would say it isn't Consider the following

A diehard skeptic being be it human or whatever attempts to doubt
one's very existence Since it is so easy to doubt everything else 
I cannot be sure the world exists it may be my mind fooling me 
can I ever be sure I exist

However it is only possible to exist or not to exist Someone
insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here  

A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence
A being that does exist can doubt one's existence but this would be
pointless  the being would exist anyway

Let us return to the original question why A being that does not
exist does not need any reasons for its nonexistence This being
is not sure whether anything else exists but his mind but let
us assume that the world exists independent of the mind the objectivity
postulate The question why anything exists can be countered by
demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness
or in nonexistence Actually both questions turn out to be
devoid of meaning Things that exist do and things that don't exist
don't exist Tautology at its best

I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question

Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually God is
Himself the existence However I see several problems with this
answer First it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is
actually all existence good and evil devils and angels us and
them This is pantheism not Christianity

Another answer is that God is the source of all existence
This sounds much better but I am tempted to ask Does God
Himself exist then If God is the source of His own existence
it can only mean that He has in terms of human time always
existed But this is not the same as the source of all existence
This argument sounds like God does not exist but metaexists
and from His metaexistent perspective He created existence
I think this is actually a nonsolution a mere twist of words

The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable
of understanding such questions Being an atheist myself I do not
accept such answers since I do not have any other methods

The second question How did the universe emerge from nothing
belongs to the domain of science and I for one do not doubt the
question can be answered by its methods Many cosmologists have
suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge
from vacuum this possibility has been suggested in a recent
Hawking biography see also Lizhi  Shuxian Creation of the Universe
World Scientific  However I think the sci groups are more
appropriate for discussions like this
 
 As far as I can tell the very laws of nature demand a why  That isn't
 true of something outside of nature ie supernatural

This is not true Science is a collection of models telling us how
not why something happens I cannot see any good reason why the why
questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the
supernatural domain exists If supernatural beings exist it is
as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist
 
 I believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes
 but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining 
 reproducing life ever  I've never been much of a prophet though I
 can't even picture New York in my mind    I don't believe any
 technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite
 having all of the parts available Just my opinion

This opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are
somehow fundamentally different from inanimate systems Do Christians
in general adopt this position What would happen when scientists announce
they have created primitive life say small bacteria in a lab

There is a problem with your prophecy artificial life has been created
although not yet in a chemical form Computer simulations of evolution
contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium although
their code is electronic as well as their metabolism See a recent book

Steven Levy Artificial life  The Quest for a New Creation Jonathan
Cape London 

Artificial chemical life is just around the corner  after all no 
spark of life has been found to be necessary living systems do not
violate any physical laws as we know them 

 You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your
 research do you  After all if we of Christ are deluding ourselves you
 really have nothing to worry about eh

Exactly This is why I think atheists should not post any evangelical
atheist arguments to socreligion groups since people who seek to 
find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together I would
normally have asked these questions in altatheism or talkreligionmisc
but it seems many Christians do not read these groups

	My problem with Science is that often it allows us to
assume we know what is best for ourselves  God endowed us
with the ability to produce life through sexual relations
for example but He did not make that availible to everyone
Does that mean that if Science can override God's decision
through alterations that God wills for us to have the power
to decide who should and should not be able to have 
children  Should men be allowed to have babies if that
is made possible

  In a word yes  I don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of
impact on the power of God  In the past God gave us the ability to create
life through sexual relations  Now he is giving us the ability to create life
through in vitro fertilization  The difference between the two is merely 
cosmetic and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to
approach the glory of God
  The power we are being given is a test and I am sure that in many cases we
will use our new abilities unwisely  But people have been using sexuality
unwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet
  No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world we aren't
impinging on God's power  It's only when we attempt to gain control of the
spiritual world those things that can't be approached through science and 
logic that we begin to interfere with God

This is not true  The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the
existence of God  As much as some people accept their Church their priests
or straight from their own scriptures as the proof this does not 
satisfy atheists

  You haven't fully explained the atheist position  Many theists believe that
there is no proof of the existence of God but choose to believe in him
anyway  I haven't yet found an argument for atheism that can't quickly be
broken down to unprovable assumptions  This isn't a problem with me everybody
needs to have a faith but if you believe that you can provide a purely 
logical argument for the nonexistence of God I'd really like to see it

Are you asking us to believe blindly  You are trying to deny that part of
us that makes us ask the question Does God exist ie selfawareness and
reason  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant
as the other animals on this earth  Does God want us to be like that

You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything  However if
we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone  And since
we can only use faith why is one picture of God eg Hinduism any less
valid than another eg Christianity

  Ahhbut when you use science and reason you have faith in certain beliefs
of the scientific methodfor example

  The physical laws of the universe are stable
  Our observations of reality are a valid basis for a determination of truth
  Objective reality exists
  Logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions
  
  Can you prove any of these

DesireeBradleymindlinkbcca Desiree Bradley writes

And from my meagre knowledge of the Bible it seems that Christians have
been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting
somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah

  This is a good point  Christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be
the Messiahin fact a number of Messiahs were active in the area from the
time of the Roman conquest to after the fall of Masada
  Many of the statements made by the apostlesespecially their repeated
attempts to give Jesus a sword give him military power point to the fact that
they didn't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact  Many of
the statements in the Bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining 
this new definition of Messiah to the Jews who were being preached to

  Hello

  I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the 
newsgroup and I think that they can be used to explain each other  
Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy

 Atheists believe that when they die they die forever

 A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death
   is unfair

  I don't see what the problem is  To Christians Hell is by definition 
eternal deathexactly what atheists are expecting when they die  There's no
reason Hell has to be especially awfulto most people eternal death is bad
enough
  Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since
the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such  Personally I don't think
that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus
with a doubleedged sword issuing from his mouthI treat both these statements
as metaphorical

In response to some of the discussions on the Sabbath Andrew Byler
commented that if we really followed sola scriptura we would worship
on Saturday  the change to Sunday was a law made by the Church and
we don't acknowledge its authority to make laws  I noted that
Protestants do not consider Sunday worship a law  clh

He was not referring to the FAQ but to the five Sabbath Admissions posted
on the bible study group  This is what prompted someone to send the FAQ
to me

  The argument against the Sabbath is
 that it is part of the ceremonial law and like the rest of the
n ceremonial law is not binding on Christians

You cannot show from scripture that the weekly Sabbath is part of the
ceremonial laws   Before you post a text in reply investigate its context

 If you accept that
 the Sabbath is not binding on Christians then the day of worship
 falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or
 since worship is by its nature a group activity churches are free to
 decide
 
Can the churches also decide what is and is not sin  Interesting  Where
there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of
operation  But we cannot be as creative with what God has explicitly
spoken on

Darius

Again in the normal Protestant interpretation Sunday is not a law
and worshipping on another day is not a sin  Churches are free to
decide on the day they will meet just as they are free to decide on
the hour  It would not be a sin to worship on some other day but if
you belong to a church that worships on Sunday and you show up on
Monday you will probably worship alone  clh

          Romans 

The sophomore says What is truth''
and turns to bask in the admiration of his peers

How modern how daring how liberating
How modern how daring how liberating
they chant

The sophomore being American
Doesn't know
That his question''

   modern
       skeptical
           cynical

Was asked before by a

   modern
       skeptical
           cynical
   urbane cosmopolitan

Politician appointed not elected
Who happened to live two thousand years ago

Like many politicians he cared

    Less about ideals
         than results

    Less about ends
         than means

    Less about anything
         than keeping his job
              and his head

We might call him
A bit brutal
Though firm' would be kinder
And no doubt Stalin who let nobody go laughed at his laxness
He didn't like his job perhaps he no longer hoped for better
Nor feared worse except regarding his head

And when these wily Jews
With their headsIwin tailsyoulose
     conundrums
Brought forth their madman
His first impulse was to play the Roman
I find nothing wrong with him
  See to it yourselves''

But when they mentioned King' and Caesar'
His heart froze

If he killed their madman
    He'd start a riot
         and lose his job
             and his head

If he saved the King of the Jews
    He'd piss off Caesar
         and lose his job
             and his head

And when his wife told him to have
   Nothing to do with the righteous lout
She didn't tell him anything
   He hadn't already figured out

So he punted

Not my jurisdiction  Take him to see Herod''
who just happened to be in town

Herod appreciated the courtesy
But wasn't worried
        And sent the sharptongued fool
     Who suddenly didn't have much to say
    funny how people lose it under pressure
  back
In the attire proper
  to his Royal State

His ass is coveredif Herod has no problem
Caesar certainly won't  The fool can be king
of whatever world he wants
as long as it's not Caesar's

I'm letting him go'' he said with a shout
Looks like he'll last this one out

The crowd's reaction puzzled him
  They really wanted him dead
They didn't want the King of the Jews
  They wanted Barabbas instead
And as Josephus records they got him

Oh well he thought
They all look the same to me
And we'll get Barabbas next time

And if I can get them to say
   We have no king but Caesar''
   By killing a madman
Hell I'll kill ten a day

And then Pilate had his fun
  A little joke
    Short
      To the point
        Trilingual

And all this
Went as it always does
When someone gets caught
In the gears of government

And there's a scientific explanation
     no doubt
For the superstitious rumors
     persisting to this day
That it didn't all end
With a tomb
and a Roman squadron on guard

Our sophomore doesn't know about this
He doesn't recognize his kindred spirit
Or truth either as he admits

I guess we haven't learned much
in two thousand years

I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned
     and the trumpet had blown
I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment
     before the white throne
Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate
They cried for the rock and the mountains
They prayed but their prayers were too late
The soul that had put off salvation 
Not tonight I'll get saved by and by
 No time now to think of  religion 
Alas he had found time to die
And I saw a Great White Throne

Now some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for
motivation yet Jesus thought it was  Paul thought it was  Paul said 
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men

Today too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of
it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship  We don't tell people anymore that
there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell  

As Jayne has said this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit
people over the head with a baseball bat  Yet the fact remains there is a
place called hell  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to
experience it  Whatever you or I as Christians do we should do whatever we
can to win people to the Lord if for no other reason to keep them from going
to outer darkness  

Jesus in Mt  tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people  He prepared
it for the Devil and his angels  No where in the Bible do I read anywhere
that God predestined anybody to go to hell  DL Moody use to say that the
elect are the whosoever will and the nonelect are the whosoever wont's 
Whether or not that's theologically sound I couldn't defend but its
practical  Jesus said to the people of Israel Ye would not  

Now some of you may not be students of the Bible heck some of you may not be
Christians  Have you ever said to somebody I don't believe in hell  I
believe in the religion of Jesus  But did you know that Jesus talked more
about hell than He did about heaven  Oh I believe in the religion of the
sermon on the mount  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the
mount  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire 
Several times he talks about hell and about judgment  In fact over and over
in the synoptics Matthew Mark and Luke Jesus talks about hell  Not Isaiah 
Not Moses  Not John the Baptist though he did but Jesus the Son of God 
The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't
want to see them go there

Now if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain  It was our Lord Jesus
not some angry Baptist preacher that said where the worm never dies and
where the fire never goes out  Jesus said that  It was Jesus who called hell
a furnace of fire  It was Jesus that used the word condemnation  And
this is the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because
their deeds are evil  Jesus said that  

How can we get it across to you that a loving dying Jesus preached about hell
 Not only that but He went through hell  That's what Calgary was all about 
When my Lord was on the cross darkness fell  He called hell outer
darkness  

Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over
here the drunks are getting drunk over there and the prostitutes are
prostituting their bodies over there  That's not what hell is  Hell's not a
party  There's no fellowship there  He called it outer darkness  Outer
away from God  Darkness God is light  

No when He was on the cross He was made sin for you and for me  God treated
Jesus the way sinners have to be treated  That's is a sobering thought  As my
son would say an awesome thought  

My God My God why hast Thou forsaken me  Hell is isolation  There's no
fellowship in hell  There's no friendship in hell  There's no loving embrace
in hell  There's no hand shake in hell  There's no word of encouragement in
hell  

I thirst  It goes much deeper than physical thirst  Hell is eternal craving
with no satisfaction  The man whose life was lived for drugs will crave it
eternally  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body will
crave it eternally and not be satisfied  One theologian has put it this way
and I think it deserves merit  What is hell  Hell is just the kind of
environment that matches the internal condition of the lost  

In a recent post I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life
ministries  I've remembered his name Jack Wertzen and found that the
illustration that I gave wasn't his  His illustration was that he was talking
to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved
and he was commenting about it to Jack  They sing these songs and read Bible
verses and their praising this and that I can't stand it  Jack do you think
God would send me to hell  Jack answered by saying Yes I think he would 
Of course the barber said What do you mean by that  Well if you can't
stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to
God now what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity  You'd
be miserable  Because God loves you He'd put you where it would match what
you really are   It makes a man think

The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal
existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act  Don't ask
me how I don't know  But He is God and He is the infiniteeternal and when He
died He died an infiniteeternal death  It is by that eternal act that He
purchased eternal life for the whosoever wills  He suffered eternal
judgment  

A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying Everybody is going
to be saved eventually  universalism  My Bible says no He'll separate
them  The sheep from the goats  After you die there's a probationary period
in which God prepares you for heaven  No my Bible says that It is appointed
unto men once to die and then comes judgment  Some of the cultist believe in
annihilation  After you die sssswish  Just like a mosquito you're squished
out  No in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as
there is in heaven  

I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy
listening to them but we have to preach the entire Word of God  There is a
place called hell  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any
hope that people aren't going there I'd give it to you but I haven't found
it  That fact that there is a place called hell the fact that our God is a
God of holiness and must judge sin the fact that He has made us the kind of
creatures we are and therefore we're responsible the fact that He has placed
us in a universe that has purpose and design behind it the fact that sin is
such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us
from hell leads us to two applications

  As I've already mentioned  If you are a Christian you must worn others 
Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just
around the bend the bridge is out  Knowing therefore the terror of Lord we
persuade men

  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior you're taking an awful
chance  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses who no longer frequent my door if
you are right and I am wrong then I will have lived a good life and will die
and cease to exist but if I am right and you are wrong then you will die and
suffer eternal damnation  I don't mean to make fun at this point but its like
Dirty Harry said You've got to ask yourself 'Do I feel lucky'  Well do
you  A man's got to know his limitations  Don't be one of the whosoever
wont's  

Because while I was yet a sinner He died for me
There's no greater love than this that a man lay down his life for another

I find it interesting that cls never answered any of the questions posed 
Then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder  He has
established a twotiered God  One set of rules for the Jews his people
and another set for the saved Gentiles his people  Why would God
discriminate  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the
Gentile rules

God has one set of rules for all his people  Paul was never against the
law  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls
the law  Paul's point is germane to both Jews and Greeks  The Law can
never be used as an instrument of salvation  And please do not combine
the ceremonial and moral laws in one

In Matt  Christ plainly says what He came to do and you say He was
only saying that for the Jews's benefit  Your Christ must be a
politician speaking from both sides of His mouth  As Paul said I have
not so learned Christ  Forget all the theology just do what Jesus says
 Your excuses will not hold up in a court of law on earth far less in
God's judgement hall

I totally agree with that sentiment  But why do you have to go further

In a short poem God in His mercy made  the fixed pains of Hell
C S Lewis expresses an idea that I'm sure was current among others
but I haven't be able to find its source

that even Hell is an expression of mercy because God limits the amount
of separation from Him and hence the amount of agony that one can
achieve


I have also heard it called an expression of mercy because Heaven would be
far more agonizing for those who had rejected God

Actually yes and no Hell is eternal death  Actually the way 
     I've had it related to me it's more of an eternal damnation
     where sinners will feel the licking flames of Hell  If I
     supposedly can feel these flames I would assume I'm still
     alive but suffering and away from God

   Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since
 the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such  Personally I don't think
 that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus
 with a doubleedged sword issuing from his mouthI treat both these state
 ments as metaphorical

I believe Jehovah's Witnesses have a similar view where the body
     sleeps for ever

I don't have a problem with being condemned to Hell either  The
     way I see it if God wants to punish me for being honest in
     my skepticism that is for saying he doesn't exist He
     certainly wouldn't be changing His nature  Besides I would
     rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven
     knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being
     scorched for his wrongdoings

Someone called REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop but
he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase
Sartre ramble about Wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument
leads to relativism

I will answer this as I find time


REXLEX' suggested that people read He is There and He is Not Silent by
Francis Schaeffer  I didn't think very highly of it but I think that
Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians  Somebody
else might like it though so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it

If someone is interested in my opinion I'd suggest On Certainty by
Ludwig Wittgenstein


Darren F Provine  kilroygbororowanedu
If any substantial number of   talkreligionmisc   readers read some
 Wittgenstein  of the postings would disappear  If they understood
 some Wittgenstein  would disappear   Michael L Siemon


Notice what I said about this book  I called it Easy reading  The reason I
dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical
Simon's  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in
philosphy classes  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your
average lay person the problem comes when you become puffed up about it 
Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person  That was who he was
writting to  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was
to simple  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one  I've been in lectures with
the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular
as well as Christian universities ND alone would fill both those catagories 
His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and
caused to rethink what their question was  I saw this time and time again at
different open forums  So yes Schaeffers books are by in large well
simplistic  It certainly isn't grad level reading  But we must get off our
high horses when it comes to recommended reading  Do you seriously think most
people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein  I may have more to
say about this secular scientist at another time

Also one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by insistent
inquisitiveness  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt
base  

Look the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality  But we must
add a qualification to give this balance  Christianity is second to none in
keeping reason in its place  We never know the value of a thing until we know
its limits  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust
it of all value

THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic
 It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism and not Christian
faith which leads to irrationality  If we forget the limits of a thing we
fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic
lesson of life 

More without limits is less  less with limits is more  

Or as I have so often stated it freedom without form soon becomes form wo
freedom

Let's put it another way  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to
absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery Think about that  It can tell the
difference between the two if you will let it  Christianity's contention with
rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it but that it has very
little else  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust
go hand in hand but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called
to go on by itself without his understanding

This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies  At such time if the
Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God it must suspend judgment
and say Father I do not understand you but I trust you  Now don't read all
your objections of me into that statement  I wasn't saying I do not understand
you at all but I trust you anyway It means that I do not understand You in
this situation but I do understand why I trust You anyway  Therefore I can
trust that you understand even though I do not The former is a mystery
unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity  The latter is
a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of
Faith  So the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational  It is
not a leap of faith but a walk of faith  As believers we cannot always know
why but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all
the difference

Now there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted
company with philosophy what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit
more difficult in practice  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith
like the insistent whying of a  year old  It isn't just that we would like
to know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we cannot
know  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied the other
leads to genuine anguish  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in
coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after
coming to faith  If we do not know why we trust God then we will always need
to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him  Failing to grasp
that we may not be able to trust him for anything we do not understand may
count decisevely against what we are able to trust  

If on the other hand we do know why we trust God we will be able to trust
him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing Too many Xian
leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which
allows for understanding at every foot fall  For what God is doing may be
ambiguous but it will not be inherently contradictory  It may be mystery to
us but mystery is only inscrutable what would be insufferable is absurdity
And that my friend was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in
practice

  I'm concerned about a recent posting about WBTSIL  I thought they'd
pretty much been denounced as a rightwing organization involved in
ideological manipulation and cultural interference including Vietnam
and South America A commission from Mexican Academia denounced them in
 as  a covert political and ideological institution used by the
US govt as an instrument of control regulation penetration espionage and
repression
  My concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even
praiseworthy by readers of socreligionchristian It's important that
Christians don't immediately accept every Christian organization as
automatically above reproach

Good heavens you mean my good friend Wes Collins who took his wife and two 
small children into the jungles of Guatemala despite dangers from primitive 
conditions and armed guerillas so that the indigenous people groups their 
could have the Bible in their native languagesthe young man who led Bible 
studies in our church who daily demonstrated and declared his deep abiding 
faith in the Lord of Loveyou mean he really was a sneaky imperialistic SPY 
whose real reason for going was to exploit and oppress the ignorant and 
unsuspecting masses  Imagine my surprise  I never would have thought it of 
him

How was this terrible deceit discovered  What exactly was the cultural 
interference they were caught committing  Attempting to persuade the locals 
that their ancestral gods were false gods and their sacrifices including 
human sacrifices in some cases were vain  Destroying traditional lifestyles 
by introducing steel tools medical vaccines and durable clothes  Oh and by 
the way who did the denouncing

I am terribly shocked to hear that my friend Wes who seemed so nice was 
really such a deceitful tool of the devil  Please provide me with specific 
documentation on this charge  There is some risk that I may not believe it 
otherwise

AFTER FOREVER

Have you ever thought about your soul
     can it be saved
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead
     you just stay in you grave
Is God just a thought within you read in a book
     when you were at school
When you think about death 
     Do you lose your breath
     Or do you keep your cool

Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope
Do you think he's a fool
Well I have seen the truth  Yes I have seen the light
     and I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared 
     When you're lonely and scared
     at the end of your days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believed in God above
They should realize before they criticise
That God is the only way to love 

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say they may as well worship the sun

I think it was true it was people like you
     that crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had
     was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near
     to say you don't believe
You had the chance but you turned it down
     now you can't retrieve
Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead  gone
Open your eyes just realize that He is the one
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear
Yes  I think it's too late


LORD OF THIS WORLD

You're searching for your mind don't know where to start
Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart
You think you know but you are never quite sure
Your soul is ill but you will not find a cure
Your world was made for you by someone above
But you choose evil ways instead of love
You made me master of the world where you exist
The soul I took from you was not even missed
Lord of the world
Evil Possessor
Lord of this world
He's now your confessor
You think you're innocent you've nothing to fear
You don't know me you say but isn't it clear
You turned to me in all your worldly
    greed and pride
But will you turn to me when it your turn to die

deletia no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat

I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can
manufacture for ourselves  Little in the cosmic sense

Ah in the cosmic sence but who lives in the cosmic sence
Not me Cosmicly we don't even exist for all practical purposes
I can hardly use the Cosmic Sence Of Stuff as a guide to life
It would just say don't bother

Luckily for mortals there are many sences of scale you can talk
about In a human sence you can have big purposes

  Even the
greatest of the great pharos are long gone the pyramids historical
oddities being worn down by the wind eventually to be turned into dust

But the influence of Aristotle Confucious Alexander Ceasar and
countless others is still with us although their works have perished

But they have changed to course of history and while humanity exists
their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing even if they
are utterly forgotten

Mankind itself will one day perish

One day surely well unless you believe in the Second Coming which
I do not

But in that time we can make a difference

 Without some interconnectedness
that transcends the physical without God it is all pointless in the
end

In the end But it must be the end until then there is all the
point you can muster And when that end comes there will be nobody
to ask Gee I don't think James Sledd's deeds are gonna make
much of a difference ulitmately ya know

But they will have already have made a difference great or small
before the end

Why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile

  Most people are able to live with that and for them little
purposes success money power effecting change helping others
suffice

Little is in the eye of the beholder of course

  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale or are at
least able to put it out of their minds

I don't doubt it But I have thought about the cosmic scale And
it does not seem to mean much to us here today

To me it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion

I would not find this comforting But perhaps it is merely my
definitions Here's what I think the relevant terms are

Reality	That which is real
Illusion	That which is not real but seems to be
Real		Objectively Existing

For reality to be an illusion would mean then

That which is real is not real but seems to be

Or

That which objectively exists does not objectively exist but
does seem to objectively exist

From which we can conclude that unless you want to get a
contradiction that no things objectively exist

But I have a problem with this because I would like to say
that I objectively exist if nothing else Cogito Ergo Sum
and all that

Perhaps you do not mean all that but rather mean
Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans

Which is not so bad and so far as I know is true

  That the
true reality underneath the the physical is spirit

Have on If reality is an illusion isn't True Reality an illusion
too And if True Reality is spirit doens't that make Spirit an Illusion
as well

If I am not distinctly confused this is getting positively Buddhist

  That this world is a school of sorts where we learn
and grow and our souls mature

That is one hell of a statement although perhaps true

Do you mean to imply that it was intended to be so If so
please show that this is true If not please explain how this
can give a purpose to anything

 That gives a purpose to my little purposes

How does it do that

Wouldn't the worldschool w intent idea make the world a preparation for
some greater purpose rather than a purpose in itself

 and takes some of the pressure off

What pressure

  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms
if you're really just here to learn

It is not necessary to be a success in human terms unless your
goals either include doing so or require doing so before they
themselves can be achived

Indeed many people have set goals for themselves that
do not include success in human terms as I understand it Check
out yer Buddhist monk type guy Out for nirvana which is not
at all the same thing

  It's more important to progress
grow persist to learn to love yourself and others and to express your
love especially when it's dificult to do so  Honest effort is rewarded
by God he knows our limitations

Why is learning to love a goal What happens if you fail in this
goal To you To God To the mysterious Purpose

priority than the direct word of Jesus in Matt Paul begins
Romans  with If someone is weak in the faith  Do you count
yourself as one who is weak in the faith

Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith

you read Jesus' word in Matt Is there any doubt in your mind
about what is right and what is sin Greek hamartia  missing the mark

Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing
the mark

However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous
proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day  As I
indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited
Whereas the Ten Commandments and Jesus' words in Matt are fairly
clear are they not

Are they clear or do you have doubts

No I don't believe that Paul can overrule God

An important first step the realization that Paul was human

However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience

Yes and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best
very weak in the faith most could not read most were unfamiliar with
the Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form Paul adapted the
message of the Bible to a largely uneducated market Granted this
market still exists today but do you count yourself as part of it To
be weak in the faith is not missing the mark hamartia if you do the
best that your education allows Are you doing the best

The Law was regarded by Jews
at the time and now as binding on Jews but not on Gentiles  There
are rules that were binding on all human beings the socalled Noachic
laws but they are quite minimal

Let me make clear that the Law is none other than the Pentateuch of
Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy What did Jesus say
about the Law in Matt Where did Jesus say that the Law only
applies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the Law

The issue that the Church had to
face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to
follow Christ  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say
that the Law was abolished  It simply acknowledged that fact that it
didn't apply to Gentiles

Who acknowledged this fact On what basis Are we extrabiblical at this
point Why not also acknowledge that the BhagavadGita is the only
relevant text for Gentiles after all we see in the Bible that it was
Magus from the east who observed the starsigns of Jesus Why bother
with any texts at all Why not just follow whatever the Church has to
say

Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 

I don't see how you can say this with a straight face Are you a
follower of Christ or do you follow someone else Are you saying that
the words of Jesus only apply to Jews

As far as I can tell both Paul and other Jewish Christians did
continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath  Thus they
continued to obey the Law

How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul

The issue was and is with Gentile
Christians who are not covered by the Law or at least not by the
ceremonial aspects of it

Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books Who
says that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments

Jesus dealt mostly with Jews  I think we can reasonably assume that
Mat  was directed to a Jewish audience

You're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews Is this
really what you mean to say You do realize that you are gutting rather
large portions of the Bible When you read Jesus' words did you ever
consider that maybe just maybe Jesus is talking to you no matter what
your race or sex If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of
Jesus are only directed to Jews why were they translated into English

He did interact with
Gentiles a few times eg the centurion whose slave was healed and a
couple of others  The terms used to describe the centurion see Luke
 suggest that he was a Godfearer ie a Gentile who followed
God but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law

As Paul would call him one who was weak in the faith

He was commended by
Jewish elders as a worthy person and Jesus accepted him as such
This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view
that Gentiles need not accept the Law

Which is more important  The recorded word of Jesus or  Indications
that you can deduce from the Bible Was Jesus God only of the Jews or
God of all humankind of all race and sex

However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on
the Law  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law we
have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law and
how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law  At least as I
read Paul he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a
certain sense superceded

This is your understanding of Paul Compare this to the word of Jesus
Are you Christian or Pauline

Again this issue isn't one of the
abolition of the Law  In the middle of his discussion Paul notes
that he might be understood this way and assures us that that's not
what he intends to say  Rather he sees the Law as primarily being
present to convict people of their sinfulness  But ultimately it's an
impossible standard and one that has been superceded by Christ

Again this is your understanding of Paul Did Jesus say that the Law
was an impossible standard Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law
Are you Christian or Pauline

Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here and not everyone
agrees with my reading

You acknowledge that it is your reading of Paul What did Jesus say
Can you deny that Matt is quite clear in its meaning Are you 
Christian or Pauline

But the interesting thing to notice is that
even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law
It still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota
or dot may be removed  For its purpose of convicting of sin it's
important that it not be relaxed

When did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin

However for Christians it's not
the end  ultimately we live in faith not Law

Please reread Matt Are you Christian or Pauline

Jesus' interpretations
emphasize the intent of the Law and stay away from the ceremonial
details

Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details

Paul's conclusion is similar  While he talks about the Law being
superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the
ceremonial law such as circumcision and the Sabbath  He is quite
concerned about maintaining moral standards

You call observance of the Sabbath the day on which the Lord rested
ceremonial Has circumcision been superceded for Christians



Are you Christian or Pauline

Both  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is
not at least not in this case  Jesus did not deal explicitly with
the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles  That's why I
have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion

As to general Jewish views on this I am dependent largely on studies
of Pauline theology one by HJ Schoeps and one whose author I can't
come up with at the moment  Both authors are Jews  Also various
Christian and nonChristian Jews have discussed the issue here and in
other newsgroups

Mat  is clear that the Law is still valid  It does not say that
it applies to Gentiles

And yes I say that the specific requirement for worship on the
Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail when you're
looking at the obligations of Gentiles  Similarly circumcision

I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject  Again it's
unfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly  However we
do know  what the st Cent Jewish approach was  how Jesus
dealt with at least one Gentile and  how Jesus' disciples dealt
with the issue when it became more acute I'm referring to Acts 
more than Paul  Given that these are all in agreement I don't see
that there's a big problem

  Hello

  I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the 
newsgroup and I think that they can be used to explain each other  
Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy

 Atheists believe that when they die they die forever

 More correctly when people die they cease to exist

 A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death
   is unfair

  I don't see what the problem is  To Christians Hell is by definition 
eternal deathexactly what atheists are expecting when they die

 The idea I've gotten is that to christians Hell is  like Heaven 
 afterlife ie you don't cease to exist but are subjected to eternal 
 torture well that's the orthodox idea anyway eternal death if you
 prefer that Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife

  Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since
the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such  Personally I don't think
that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus
with a doubleedged sword issuing from his mouthI treat both these state
ments as metaphorical

 I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical Certainly
 not the equivalent of ceasing to exist Some christian concepts are indeed
 metaphors but your idea of Hell is a th century interpretation It is of
 course nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview 
 of modern age but I fear the church will not accept it Understandably per
 haps because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor then you're one step
 closer to turning God into a metaphor as well

In a previous message  aafreenetcarletonca Mark Baker writes

If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong
then I don't have a belief This is simply what belief means

 More stuff deleted

This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief  My beliefs
are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the
world  This experience includes study of things that I may not have
experienced directly  But even then I can only understand the
studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what
I have experienced

Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my
experience of God  Having experienced God I try to make sense of
that experience  I study religion and read the Bible  I find things
that echo what I have already experienced  Out of this I build my
beliefs  I also find things that don't match my experience  That
doesn't make them false  They just don't match my experience  Maybe
I will understand that stuff later  I don't know  Maybe all of my
beliefs are wrong  I can change my beliefs

If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine so what
Neither of us are necessarily wrong  Someone else is making sense out
of a different set of experiences  Even though we have different
explanations and beliefs if we talk we might even discover that the
underlying experiences are similar

Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one
form and usually has a single revelation  The more dogmatic and
inflexible the belief system the more arrogant it will appear to an
outsider  There is another approach possible however  God is a
mystery  I am trying to solve the mystery so I look at the evidence
available to me  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can
based on the evidence  New evidence may cause me to change my
understanding  When I encounter someone with a different belief than
my own it isn't a threat it is an opportunity to perhaps discover
something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend

Well I think that most Christians believe that your conciousness will
somehow continue on after your 'physical' death which contradicts what
most atheists myself included believe namely that your conciousness
being contained in your brain dies when your brain dies

There's no
reason Hell has to be especially awfulto most people eternal death is bad
enough

I fear the pain that often comes with the process of dying but since I
won't be around to worry about it I don't fear eternal death

  Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since
the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such  

This is something I've always found confusing  If all your nerve endings
die with your physical body why would flame hurt you  How can one wail
and gnash teeth with no lungs and no teeth

Most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this
but the Branch Davidian compound is no more  This morning about 
the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank  They 
then started using nonlethal tear gas  Shortly after noon  cult
members were seen setting fire to the compound  So far about 
people have been seen outside the compound  The fate of the other  or
 people is unknown neither is the fate of the  children that were
inside  The compound did burn to the ground

Koresh who at times has claimed to be the Messiah but then backed off
and only claimed to be a prophet had promised several times to come
out peacefully if his demands were met  First he demanded that his
message be broadcast on the radio which it was but he didn't come out
He claimed to be waiting for a message from God  Finally he said that
God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the  seals in
Revelation and when he was finished he'd come out  He finished the
first one but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then
The federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out they 
would be subjected to tear gas

I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere
man even if he did claim to be the son of God andor a prophet  I
think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in
things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures
say and what they mean instead of relying on others to do it for you
even if those others are learned and mean well

  I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the 
newsgroup and I think that they can be used to explain each other  
Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy

 Atheists believe that when they die they die forever

 A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death
   is unfair

  I don't see what the problem is  To Christians Hell is by definition 
eternal deathexactly what atheists are expecting when they die

This is the problem This is not hell this is permanent death It is
indeed what atheists generally expect and it is neither fair nor
unfair it just is You might as well argue about whether being made
mostly of carbon and water is fair

However the atheists who claim that Hell is unfair are talking about
the fire and brimstone place of endless suffering which necessarily
includes eternal existance life I dunno but some sort of continuation
not at all the same thing

Granted you clearly feel that helldeath but this is not a univeral
sentiment as near as I can tell

If your idea of God condemns heathens to ordinary death I have no
problem with that I do have a problem with the gods that hide from humans
and torture the unbelievers eternally for not guessing right

  This is why the most effective 
substanceabuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples' spiritual

You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim
like this

In step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous one of the steps
involves acknowleding a higher power  AA and other step abuse
recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective

deletia and so on

I seem to have been rather unclear

What I was asking is this

Please show me that the most effective substanceabsure recovery
programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs rather than
merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved
by the people AA SRC regulars or snoopy This will probably
involve defining spritual needs is it not that clear and
showing that such things exist and how they can be filled

Annother tack you might take is to say that fulfilling spiritual
needs means acknowledging a higher power of some sort then
show that systems that do require this work better than otherwise
identical systems that do not A correlation here would help you
but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping
one crutch for annother however I do feel that religion is
usually a better crutch than alchohol as it is not usually
poisonous  

I hope with that clarification my question will be answerable I actually
did know about the  step program its the question of what it does
rather than what it tries to do that makes a difference to me

It's like refusing 'God's kingdom come'

In one of Jesus' revelation in this century same thing as in
the old days  People refuse to believe my messengers  Even when
I was alive here on earth they refuse Me  What more when I am just
talking through somebody else paraphrased

With all the knowledge believers accumulated He would think that
we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are 
'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or manmade'

These signs these miracles are you afraid that they are not from God
That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking
  they are evil
Well is faith in God evil
Is true peace evil  Is true love that is divine and pure evil 
Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His
  generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to
  Him for salvation
Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth  The mother to all who are
  in Christ
What brings us these
    fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us
        which in contrary could be pleasing to God
    fears of being humbled
    fears of being judged as wrong wrt mainstream standard of what is right
Why can't we tolerate nonbelievers' mockery or ridicule of us for the
  sake of peace love and obedience to God  The humbling lessons left to us
  by martyrs and saints
We'd rather engage in neverending bickering and disproof of each other's
  opinion  looking at each other's mistakes  for the sake of arguments
  instead of having communion in one body with Christ
What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can
  not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages
Why is our faith in God limited  By all the words and literature we muster
What prevents us from going beyond being saved and extend God's rich love
  to others who are not

Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith hope
  and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His 
  acknowledgements with signsmiracles ordinarycommon or divinely inspired 
  everywhere  Isn't that like an atheistagnostic's view that all these
  are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural

Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us
  We must really accept that prayer changes the course of things and that
  with prayers even wars can be prevented
but then she continues
  You often have an egotistic attitude  Dear children in these days you
  have prayed very much but your hands have remained empty
Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done
  prayer conversion peace penance fasting the Holy Mass living life
  as what the Gospel brings
Why not do so  How  To the world
To this the Mother says
  Start in your family  Be a good example  Live the Word
Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many
Our Holy Mother says
  The fruits leave them to the Lord do not worry about anything or 
  anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord

Although the Holy Mother does not insist because
  You are free I bow before the freedom which God gives you
but she follows this with
  You are surprised because I say to you Decide for God and yet see how
  you have lived this day
Why does she constantly conveys
  Take this life toward God in the way as to experience the Lord Himself
  in your behavior and not only when you pray or one time when we 
  decide that we are saved or talkwrite about God etc
The Holy Mother warns
  Satan the serpent is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from
  my peace plan and prayer  Rev  the dragon became angry with the woman
  and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings those who keep
  God's commandments and bear witness to Jesus

Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace love and
  our motherly protector from the antiChrist
The one who is being apprehensive of communism wars famine and other evils
  that the serpent brings upon us 
This obedient and blessed new Eve
The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan
Haven't there been renewed faith hope love peace and obedience wherever
  this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her
  in good purpose
Why do we choose to be blind
Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's
  everforgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother
The mother who has been consecrated the task to reverse the disobedient
  harm and example done by the ancient Eve
She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart
The new Eden as sanctuary the womb for the next coming and judgement of the 
  righteous by our Lord Jesus Christ when The Lamb marries His bride
Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the
  second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear
  the Son of God in her womb
Why fear true peace love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary
  faithfully brings to God's children  She has been protecting the flock
  the rest of the offsprings from the greedy dragon so as to present more 
  righteous members for her Son's coming
Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy
  of belief  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and of course
  approval of our Church authorities we should be aware of the true and
  divinely inspired ones specifically the ones which aligns with the
  Scripture
  

Also our Lady reminds us of recommendation of silence in our prayers
  If you speak unceasingly in your prayers how will you be able to hear
  God  Allow Him room to answer you to speak to you 

She encourages us with motherly nurturing to continue in exuberant 
faith hope and love to Jesus constantly  NOT with mere emotions 
but with deep constant obedience to Jesus her Beloved Son and
acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives

Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life
that God wants us to live when there won't be enough time or when
it will be late
                                                      
Nowadays Mary says 
Pray pray pray for peacereconciliation my children
Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to
others  For without peace you can not fully accept my Son
                                                                       

And you think she's just an ordinary lady  Not to me  She's
our good Mothermessenger from God and she is so nice enough to
share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it

With Mary we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds

This may be a really dumb one but I'll ask it anyways
       Christians know that they can never live up to the requirements of  
God right I may be wrong but that is my understanding  But they still  
try to do it  Doesn't it seem like we are spending all of our lives  
trying to reach a goal we can never achieve  I know that we are saved by  
faith and not by works but does that mean that once we are saved we don't  
have to do anything  I think James tells us that Faith without works is  
dead paraphrase  How does this work

Short reply  We can never achieve perfect health yet we always strive for it  
We don't seek to do God's will because we're forced to we follow His way 
because His way is best  The reason it's hard is because we are flawed not 
because He's unreasonable  But we seek to follow His way because we want to 
improve ourselves and our lives

Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for
straying from orthodoxy but here is my opinion

In article Aprgenevarutgersedu mdbsmsukyedu no name writes
  Moreover the Buddha says that we are 
 intrinsically good as against Christ's we are all sinners

I never thought of these two ideas being against each other
People might quibble about what intrinsically means but the
reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we
are The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good
but great that we can approach perfection albeit perhaps through a 
different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches Because we do
not realize our greatness we sin Peter had no problem walking 
on water until a little doubt crept in

Doesn't David ask in the th Psalm what is man that you God 
should care for him but you have made him just a little lower 
than the angels

I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David
was just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath
was but David's power easily defeated Goliath's

Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what
he can do to enter the Kingdom Jesus says follow the commandments
I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that
his whole life probably anticipating an attaboy from the 
Messiah Instead Jesus gives him a harder task sell everything
and follow Him Jesus is raising the bar The desciples say
how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people
Jesus says anyone can do it with God's help

Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people we can avoid
getting angry at people Not only can we avoid committing
adultery we can control our own desires 

I realize this was not your main point but I wonder how other
people see this 

 
 	Parting Question
 		Would you have become a Christian if you had not
 been indoctrinated by your parents You probably never learned about
 any other religion to make a comparative study And therefore I claim
 you are brain washed

Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make

Your point about how hard other religions are is a good one just 
as your Parting Question is a tough question I think that Muslims
worship the same God as I do we can learn from their name submission
Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists etc claim that God is impersonal 
Is God personal or impersonal I say yes but if I think a little
more my answer is whichever is greater I think it is greater 
to be a personal entity with an individual consciousness but
you're right that that might be a cultural bias If I think more
I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my
conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's
conception If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology
then maybe I wouldn't have a problem though that is hard to imagine

Are there any former or present Eastern Religion members here 
who could comment

In article Aprgenevarutgersedu jhpbsartobuddlakenjus Joseph H Buehler writes

Descriptions of true and false obedience

Obedience is not solely a matter of compliancerefusal  The nature of
the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to
consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are
obedient or disobedient  You also have to take into consideration
whether the commands are good or bad

You ask where we are  I would echo that question  I'm not trying to be
contentious  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction
and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions
What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that
Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time
This is especially true since Councils of Bishops have basically
stood by the Pope

It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is
disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition and also over
authority and discipline  

My question to the supporters of SSPX is this

  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms
  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope assuming that
  the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX
  don't jointly make such  choice

If not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority
If I adopt the view that I'm NOT wrong I CAN'T be wrong and
there's NO WAY I'll change my mind YOU must change yours that
I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me

The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authorityjurisdiction
viewing authority as present in each bishop and in Ecumenical
Councils  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines 
regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of
the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church  Without going into
the merits of the Great Schism at least the Orthodox agree that
a split occurred and don't paly what appear to be semantic games
like He's the Pope but we don't recognize that what he does
is effective  Words aside it appears to be a de facto split

So where are we  Are we in another Arian heresy complete with weak
Popes  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers  Well the only
way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the
traditional teaching of the Church is

We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the real
traditional teaching of the Church is  If this were a simple matter
East and West would not have been separated for over  years
 
Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope  There is some
soundness in this because the Papacy is infallible so eventually
some Pope will straighten all this out

I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow
error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term
I may be wrong here I'm not Roman Catholic 

What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement
regarding the SSPX situation  Would it be honored  If not how
do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility
Again I'm not trying to be contentions I'm trying to understand
Since I'm Orthodox I've got no real vested interest in the outcome
one way or the other

Schism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate
command  All schismatics are disobedient  But it's a superset so
it doesn't work the other way around not all disobeyers are
schismatics  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with
the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics

It does if the command was legitimate  SSPX does not view the
Pope's commands as legitimate  Why  This is a VERY slippery slope
 
                                      But my problem with this is
this according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders episcopal
consecration does not confer jurisdiction  It only confers the power
of Order the ability to confect the Sacraments  

True enough

                                                  Jurisdiction must be
conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the
Pope  The Society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite
well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over
anyone  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop

One could argue that they are establishing a nongeographic jurisdiction
I don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles

Although I certainly agree with the basic sentiment that snideness is

ill temper is not a Christian trait It seems like a false argument to
say that anyone who displays trait X must not be a Christian Could
well be a sinning Christian but a Christian nonetheless
Anger is human and Christians are
human Christians get angry and defensive and react badly just like
everyone else It's not perfect righteousness but the effort of seeking
righteousness that marks a dedicated Christian And one of the greatest
gifts of faith to me is that of seeking and accepting forgiveness for
my failures Expecting flawless behavior from self or others isn't

I would recommend Essential Truthes of the Christian Faith by RC Sproul
It is copywrited  from Tyndale House Publishers Sproul offers concise 
explanations in simple language of around  different Christian 
doctrines grouped by subject I think it would be particularly good for
newer Christians and older Christians suffering spiritual malnutrition
as it gives a Biblically sound basic treatment of the issues avoiding

Several people were involved in trying to figure out who first used
the phrase Godshaped hole  clh

There is a God shaped vacuum in all of us or something to that effect is
generally attributed to Blaise Pascal
What I want to know is how can you have a God shaped vacuum inside of you if
God is in fact infinite or omnipresent

Hello everyone

Last week I posted a similar question to altwedding  Now I come in
search of a deeperlevel answer

My fiance is Lutheran and I am Catholic  We plan on getting married in
her church because she is living there now and I plan on moving there
in a month or so  I called my Catholic priest to find out what I needed
to do in order for the marriage to be recognized by my church

Needless to say that I have found that there is no hard and fast rule
when it comes to how the Catholic law for interfaith weddings is interpreted
But I'm pretty sure that we CAN get married without too much problem the
trick lies in the letter of dispensation

But that is not why I am here

What I'd like to know is 
  What are the main differences between the Lutheran and Catholic religions
  My priest mumbled something about how the Eucharist was understood
  I have heard that if two religions combine soon it would be these two

Any help would be appreciated

Thanks so much

Bill

We've had enough CatholicProtestant arguments recently that I'm not

they are clearly noncontroversial  I would be happy to see positive

other things they'd be useful for the FAQ collection  But I'm not up
for yet another battle  clh

This may be a really dumb one but I'll ask it anyways
	Christians know that they can never live up to the requirements of  
God right I may be wrong but that is my understanding  But they still  
try to do it  Doesn't it seem like we are spending all of our lives  
trying to reach a goal we can never achieve  I know that we are saved by  
faith and not by works but does that mean that once we are saved we don't  
have to do anything  I think James tells us that Faith without works is  
dead paraphrase  How does this work

So long as we think that good things are what we have to do rather than
what we come to want to do we miss the point The more we love God the
more we come to love what and whom He loves

When I find that what I am doing is not good it is not a sign to try
even harder Romans  it is a sign to seek God When I am aware 
of Jesus' presence I usually want what He wants It is His strenth His love 
that empowers my weakness

I apologize to the moderator but the first quote was deleted and I
would like to respond to both

As for the goal we can never achieve the reward comes from the
trying  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for
the prize over in Philippians   Only by not living out the
commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm to be spit out by Jesus
As it says in  John   This is love for God  to obey his comands
That obedience is our straining to achieve for God  Of course this
requires work on our part

As for the quote in James Satan doesn't care what we believe  What
matters is the results of our belief works  If one truly has faith in
what one believes one will either act on that faith or be lying to
oneself about believing in the first place  

Stan as for your first line you have a very good point  Obedience by
obligation grudgery is not what God desires  Instead look at how
many times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when
doing God's work  Being begrudged by the work has no value  Also we
should do the work necessary whenever we can not just when we feel
Jesus' presence  Feelings can deceive us  However as Paul states to
Timothy in  Timothy   Preach the Word be prepared in season and
out of season correct rebuke and encouragewith great patience and
careful instruction  Also remember that Paul tells Timothy in 
Timothy   Watch your life and doctrine closely  Persevere in
them because if you do you will save both yourself and your hearers
So in order to do the work necessary we need to be sure that we are
correct first  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew  not to be
hypocritical about what we do  The best way to accomplish this is to be
a disciple completely in both thought and deed

You cannot show from scripture that the weekly Sabbath is part of the
ceremonial laws   Before you post a text in reply investigate its context

First of all ceremonial law is an extraScriptural term  It is sometimes
used as a framework to view Scripture  But if you look at Collosions
without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be 
a ceremonial law you will see that it does refer to the sabbath

Paul writes in Collosions  how that Christ nailed the laws that were
against us to His cross and therefore we should not be judged in what
what food we eat what we drink the keeping of new moons and holy days
or the keeping of the sabbath

The word for sabbath in this verse is sabbaton and is used throughout the
New Testament to refer to the th day  If there is any Scripture from
which we get the idea of the ceremonial law this is one of them and the
sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws

If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption the sabbath cannot
be a ceremonial law then he will have to find some way around it like
saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the
tH day Because the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law  But
Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal 
statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin
in his writings

Also why is the sabbath absent from the epistles except for Hebrews  which
talks about the rest that comes through faith  Surely it would have
been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society
that did not rest on the th day  Especially slaves Many new converst were
slaves  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath
if it had been mandatory  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles

   The discussion begins why does the universe exist at all  
  
  One of the Laws of Nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate 
  at least to this layman's mind there must be a causal event  No
  reasonable alternative exists
 
 I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime 
 causes precede their effects 

And I must concede here  Cause before effect implies time time is part
of spacetime  Hense the argument would be valid  I could return and say 
that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being unique
to this spacetime but I won't  because the point is moot  Doesn't
address why which Petri Pikho addresses below  

I also concede that I was doubly remiss as I asserted No reasonable
alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one
that could  be invalidated given time and further discovery by the
scientist  I also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily
specify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description of
the phenomena in question  Am I mistaken with this understanding

 But if you claim that there must be
 an answer to how did the universe our spacetime  emerge from 
 nothing science has some good candidates for an answer

All of which require something we Christians readily admit to Faith''

The fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive  
With out conclusive evidence we are left with faith

It could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven as
best as a nonrepeatable event can be proven  But I ask what holds  
someone today to the belief that any or all of them are correct except by 
faith

 a couple of paragraphs deleted  Summary we ask Why does the
universe exist 

 I think this question should actually be split into two parts namely
 
  Why is there existence Why anything exists
 
 and
 
  How did the universe emerge from nothing
 
 It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question However
 is it a meaningful question after all

 I would say it isn't Consider the following

Apparently it is for many persons  Hence we have religions

 The question why anything exists can be countered by
 demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness
 or in nonexistence  Actually both questions turn out to be
 devoid of meaning Things that exist do and things that don't exist
 don't exist Tautology at its best

Carefully examine the original question and then the counterquestion 
The first asks Why while the second is a request for definition  It 
doesn't address why something does or does not exist but asks to define 
the lack of existence  The second question is unanswerable indeed for
how do we identify something as nothing aren't they mutually exclusive
terms  How do we identify a state of nonexistence again this is
nearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend and I
would appreciate an explanation 

I might add the worldview of Things that exist do and things that
don'tdon't is as grounded in the realm of the nonfalsifiable
as does the theist's belief in God  It is based on the assumption
that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately
unsupportable as the position of there being a reason  Its very
foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a
reason

We come to this Either I am therefore I am or I am for a reason
If the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are
satisfied and need not a doctor  If the latter your search is just
beginning  

 I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question

Time will tell 

 
 Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually God is
 Himself the existence However I see several problems with this
 answer First it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is
 actually all existence good and evil devils and angels us and
 them This is pantheism not Christianity

Agreed  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as
well

 Another answer is that God is the source of all existence
 This sounds much better but I am tempted to ask Does God
 Himself exist then If God is the source of His own existence
 it can only mean that He has in terms of human time always
 existed But this is not the same as the source of all existence

This does not preclude His existence  It only seeks to identify His
qualities implying He exists to have qualities BTW

 The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable
 of understanding such questions Being an atheist myself I do not
 accept such answers since I do not have any other methods

Like the theist we come to a statement of faith for this position assumes 
that the evidence at hand is conclusive  Note I am not arguing against 
scientific endeavor for science is useful for understanding the universe in
which we exist But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective  I
seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the
Creator

I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why   It
appears that M Pihko agrees as we shall see  But because a tool is
inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question  Asserting
that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer  

  As far as I can tell the very laws of nature demand a why  That isn't
  true of something outside of nature ie supernatural
 
 This is not true Science is a collection of models telling us how
 not why something happens I cannot see any good reason why the why
 questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the
 supernatural domain exists If supernatural beings exist it is
 as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist

My apologies  I was using why as why did this come to be  Why did
preexistence become existence  Why did prespacetime become spacetime

But we come to the admission that science fails to answer Why  Because
it can't be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the
question invalid
  I don't believe any
  technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite
  having all of the parts available Just my opinion
 
 This opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are
 somehow fundamentally different from inanimate systems Do Christians
 in general adopt this position What would happen when scientists announce
 they have created primitive life say small bacteria in a lab

I suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was 
vindicated  before someone starts jumping up and down screaming
Inquisition note I said vindicated  I certainly hope we've gotten
beyond the shooting the messenger stage

M Pihko does present a good point though  We may need to ask What do I 
as an individual Christian base my faith on  Will it be shaken by the
production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to
understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God said and
continues to say in his Word

Why do I ask why apologies to Budweiser and company

Some thoughts

A On the nonpacifist side

 Killing to defend the innocent may be if anything more justifiable
than killing in selfdefense  I can turn my own other cheek but I have
no right to turn someone else's

 It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism He would have
made His position more explicit  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the
army for instance and the NT is full of military metaphors

B On the pacifist side

 Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army
or stated that one should refuse if given a choice  But it's not clear
whether they were objecting to war per se or objecting to Roman policies

 In modern warfare it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at
combatants  Bombing both conventional and nuclear kills lots of civilians

 It's hard to tell whether any particular war is justified at the time
Often it takes decades for the requisite information to become available
to the general public

The following is my comment on an article by Desiree Bradley  clh

By the way from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me
that he is claiming to be Christ

Koresh did originally claim to be the Christ but then backed off and
said he was a prophet  The latest news at  CDT from Waco is that
the feds broke through a wall of the compound with a tank  No news
besides that at this time

 For all those people who insist I question authority Why

How about

	The Holocaust
	The Spanish Inquisition
	Jonestown

just to name a few 

Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things  People who just
follow orders have tortured and killed others in very large numbers
and protest their innocence afterwards

When your authority starts telling you to do things you should ask
questions  Except for situations of pressing need I said shut the
hatch because the submarine is filling with water any reasonable
authority should be able to give at least some justification that you
can understand

Just be sure to listen when authority answers

If anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and
 following orders you might want to read about a study done by Solomon Ashe
 in  on conformity and another done by Stanley Milgram in  on
 obedience  Both should be in any good book on psychologysociology  The
 results are both fascinating and terrifying

     Sorry for posting this but my email keeps bouncing  Maybe it will
help others here anyway and therefore I pray others will read this  It is
actually a response from my Aunt who has  kids since I have none yet

Hi I am a Sociology student and I am currently researching into
young offenders  I am looking at the way various groups of
children are raised at home  At the moment I am formlulating
information on discipline within the Christian home

Please if you are a parent in this catagory can you email me
your response to the following questionaire  All responses
will be treated confidentially and will only be used to prepare
stats
     I'm posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have email
access  Since this aunt and uncle have  kids I felt they would be more
relevant than I who have none yet

  Ages  sexes of children
     yearold YO twins YO boy YO boy YO girl

  Do you spank your kids
     I don't call it spanking but they do so yes very rarely

  If so how often
     I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something
very dangerous such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running
into the road  Maybe  times for each except for the YO girl who has
not been spanked yet
     They call it that because it does hurt their feelings and of course
I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved

  Do you use an implement to spank with
     No that would be too painful  If it's too traumatic they never recall
why they were punished  Besides it must be immediate and taking the time
to go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away and that lessens the
impact  It's very emotional for a child as it is  which is evidenced by the
fact that a little slap on the rear  which hurts for perhaps  seconds 
is called a spanking

 If you do not spank what method of discipline do you use
     Lots of logical consequences  for instance when YO Matthew dared
a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out I made
sure they didn't play together for  days so he'd know that would make him
lose friends very quickly  He's never done anything like that since
     We also use timeout in their rooms  I use a timer so they don't keep
arguing with me over leaving since it's hard to argue with a macine
I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they
calm down if they're too tantrumy  I use the top of the stairs when they're
really young

  Your age
     

  Your location
     Bath Ohio  It's right outside of Akron in the northeast part of Ohio

  While under the age of  did you ever commit a criminal
offence
     No and none of my kids would dream of it  I hope you can use this to
teach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required  parents use
that as an excuse to hit too hard

  How ere you disciplined as a kid
     Lots of timeouts same as I use  Our family and my husband's have never
used spankings  In fact my grandmother in law was one of  kids and they

a little slap on the rear but what I would have given would have been the

to hisher room and went to my room myself  After praying and asking God's
forgiveness I was much calmer and did not feel like spanking but felt that
what I had done was enough punishment

  I'm concerned about a recent posting about WBTSIL  I thought they'd
pretty much been denounced as a rightwing organization involved in
ideological manipulation and cultural interference including Vietnam
and South America A commission from Mexican Academia denounced them in
 as  a covert political and ideological institution used by the
US govt as an instrument of control regulation penetration espionage and
repression

I have personally know quite of few of the Wycliffe Bible Translators
As an organization their fundamental purpose is to translate the scriptures
into the native languages which in terms usual means learning it and 
developing a written language along with teaching the natives to read
It is not associated with the US govt at all  Many governments
want the help of the translators  To the best of my knowledge the 
Mexican government now encourages them to come  Their idea is not
cultural interference but the presentation of the Good News

To understand more about what they do I suggest you read some of the books
autobiographical and biographical about some of the translators  One
that stands out in my mind as an excellent is called Peace Child
This would give a true picture of what their mission is

  My concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even
praiseworthy by readers of socreligionchristian It's important that
Christians don't immediately accept every Christian organization as
automatically above reproach

                                                                  mp
I agree with this statement but we cannot also accept what others
say without looking into the issues  That would be the same as taking 
Suddan's discussion about the CIA etc as being true  We must look
at both sides

I think you're talking about the assumption of the Blessed Virgin
Mary  It says that The Immaculate Mother of God the ever Virgin
Mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed
body and soul into heavenly glory  This was defined by a Papal
statement in  though it had certainly been believed by some

Roman Catholic doctrine and like it it has no direct Biblical

That is they do not believe that the Bible is the only source of

that it can be revealed to the Church  I'm not interested in yet
another CatholicProtestant argument but if any Catholics can tell us
the basis for these beliefs I think it would be appropriate  clh


	Again I find myself wanting to respond to a posting and having neither
the time nor the proper materials with me you would think I would learn my
lesson by nowbut I'm trying to finish writing my Thesis and don't have tons
of time  Anyway

	The basis for our the catholic church's belief in the assumption of
Mary body and soul into heaven is that to put it simply the apostles 
and all the early generation Christians believed it  In fact throughout their
ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary and  of the  were
present when she died  Only Thomas was missingwhen he arrived several days
later he asked to be shown her body and moved with pity Peter and several of
the other apostles brought him to her tomb  When they arrived the seal was
still unbroken  They broke the seal entered and the body was missing  There
was no sign that anyone had entered forcibly or otherwise and everything else
was laid out exactly as it had been left  The apostles present all believed
that Mary was assumed into heavenand the apostles TAUGHT this in their  
preaching of course this does not appear in any of the texts currently 
considered part of the bible but it does appear in other writings left behind
by several of them  Basicaly as an apostolic church ie founded by the
apostles we believe that the teachings of the apostles whether written down
in the bible or written down in other sources is true providing that the
authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed  At least in the case of
the assumption of Mary the authenticity is quite clear

	Hope this helpsI would welcome anyone who has more information to
	add to what I've said

So true  I'm not sure of the basis of the belief but it was a widely
held belief among the laity of the RC church and their support of it
lead to it being declared to be true  Basically the teaching on infallibility
holds that the pope is infallible in matters of faith and doctrine the
college of bishops is likewise infallible and the laity is as well
The pope gets most of the attentioncriticism but the consensus of the
other bodies is equally infallible according to RC teaching

Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception

 I will put enmity between you the Serpent and the woman and
between your seed and her seed she can also be read he shall crush
your head and you shall bruise her or his heel
    Genesis 

 He who commits sin is of the devil 
     John 

 Hail full of grace greek  kecharitomene the Lord is with thee 
    Luke 

   From the above we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception
   First God has given the protoevangel in Genesis  which is the
first promise of a savior who will redeem mankind from the wiles of
Satan Satan was a murderer from the beginning and has not stood in
the truth because there is no truth in him John   Now the
protoevangel promises several things enmity between Satan and the
woman and enmity between Satan and her seed  Now the woman is both
Eve who is the immediate point of reference and Mary the second Eve 
Her seed is Jesus Christ and He is also at enmity with Satan in the
same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan  Thus knowing as
we do that Jesus Christ is sinless Hebrews  we can conclude that
Mary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would  not be at enmity
with the devil as  John  tells us and  the relation of her
sinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question as
would God's veracity  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the
serpent and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved
    Second we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the
Archangle Gabriel full of grace  As I pointed out above this is from
the Greek word Kecharitomene which means not just full of grace but a
plenitude or perfection of grace  The sense of it is best grasped by
the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible Hail you who have been and reamin
filled with grace  But that is a little to long to say so it is
reduced to full of grace  And as it says you who have been Mary had
always been filled with grace from the moment of her conception which
was also the moment of her salvation until her death some years later
    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done
what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do  And if
God could keep himself free from any contact with sin through his
Mother He would have and the Bible records this fact to which the
Fathers of the Church such as St John Damascus St Augustine of Hippo
 St Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with as is all of
Christian tradition and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on
the matter in Ineffibilus Deus

I have a simple test I take several people who can speak
only one language eg chinese russian german english
Then I let the gifted one start speaking in toungues
The audience should understand the gifted one clearly
in their native language However the gifted one can
only hear himself speaking in his own language

Perhaps I would believe the gifted ones more if they were
glorifying God rather than themselves Then perhaps we'd

From time to time I have made reference to a book called The Two Babylons
which is a book written by Alexander Hislop mid 's about the Babylonian
mystery religion and its flight through history  I was unable to put it down
the first time I read it but others have found it dry  It has numberable
references and illustrations  If you are interested in purchasing your own
copy you can call Moody Book Store   and order it for  and
they will ship it to you   
  It is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the
mystery religions  I have found it invaluable for that purpose alone  But for
those who only want to skim the subject it comes highly recommended  
  Just a note to my RC brothers and sisters  You may find this to be a
diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the
origin of RCism  If you are offended by anything that asks hard questions
about your denomination as to whether or not it is Christian then perhaps
you should just passover this offer  To those who are a little more
adventurous go for it and later please contact me with you reasons pro or con
on the scholorship of this book  I really would be interested

The movie version
of The Last Temptation of Christ was so awful that practically no one
would have seen it or been influenced by its message had not
conservatives loudly protested its distribution  They unwittingly
created a larger market for the movie

In many places Christians were sucessful in their attempts
to get the films banned or at least given a very restrictive 
showing

I have no problem with Christians burning their own pieces of
art though I find it a tragic waste I do however have a 
problem with their attempts to censor what I may or may not

If you are using the standard formula of fully God and fully human
that I'm not sure why you object to saying that Jesus was human  I
think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic
definition of humanity  It's a consequence of the fall  Jesus is
human but not a fallen human  clh

The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism  This was a
heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in  AD  It
grew up in reaction to Nestorianism which held that the Son and Jesus
are two different people who happened to be united in the same body
temporarily  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia
and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox  It believes
that Jesus Christ was God which is correct that he was man which is
correct that he was one person which is correct but that he had
only one nature and one will and oen energy which is heretical the
orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two
energies both divine and human though the wills were in perfect
harmony  That is what Mike is trying to get across that while Jesus
came in human form Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human
will  In reality he had both though neither made him subject to
original sin
It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this
conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but
not two wills or two energies  It also was condemned at a late council
in Constantinople I believe

Andy Byler

These issues get mighty subtle  When you see people saying different
things it's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously
different things or whether they are using different terminology  I
don't think there's any question that there is a problem with
Nestorius and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form
without a real human nature or will is heretical  But I'd like to be
a bit wary about the Copts Armenians etc  Recent discussions
suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from
orthodoxy as many had thought  Nestorius was an extreme
representative of one of the two major schools of thought  More
moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox eg Theodore of
Mopsuestia  My impression is that the modern monophysite groups
inherit the entire tradition not just Nestorius' version and that
some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as
orthodox  clh

I sinned And straightway posthaste Satan flew
Before the presence of the Most High God
And made a railing accusation there
He said This soul this thing of clay and sod
Has sinned 'Tis true that he has named Thy name
But I demand his death for Thou hast said
'The soul that sinneth it shall die' Shall not
Thy sentence be fulfilled Is justice dead
Send now this wretched sinner to his doom
What other thing can righteous ruler do
Thus Satan did accuse me day and night
And every word he spoke O  God was true

Then quickly One rose up from God's right hand
Before whose glory angels veiled their eyes
He spoke Each jot and tittle of the law
Must be fulfilled the guilty sinner dies
But wait  suppose his guilt were all transferred
To Me and that I paid his penalty
Behold My hands My side My feet One day
I was made sin for him and died that he
Might be presented faultless at Thy throne
And Satan flew away  Full well he knew
That he could not prevail against such love
for every word my dear Lord spoke was true

 just how inconceivable it is to mix Christianity with homosexuality

You might visit some congregations of Christians who happen to be homosexuals
that are spiritfilled believers not MCC'rs before you go lumping us all
together with Troy Perry  

The Lord IS working in our community the homosexual community that is  He's
not asking us to change our sexual nature but He is calling us to practice
the morality that He established from the beginning

Isn't Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issue
he can especially homosexuality  Let's reach the homosexuals for Christ 
Let's not try to change them just need to bring them to Christ  If He
doesn't want them to be gay He can change that  If they are living a moral
life committed to someone of the same sex and God is moving in their lives
who are we to tell them they have to change

That is generally accuate but contains one serious error  We Catholics
do believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in
the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church
It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church otherwise known as
Sacred Tradition is not the same as ordinary human traditions
However we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to
the Church  Public revelation which is the basis of Catholic doctrine
ended with the death of St John the last Apostle  Nothing new can
be added  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications
that were not recognized previously so that the Council of Nicea could
define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation
that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed
before the council but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at
any subsequent council

Cardinal Newman's An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine
written while he was still an Anglican is an excellent discussion of
of this point  It was recently reprinted as a Doubleday Image Books
paperback with some related shorter works under the title Conscience
Consensus and the Development of Doctrine

Do you have any evidence that it is used by the Orthodox Churches

Note that in this perhaps the oldest of the creeds there is no mention

death There is only the resurrection of the body and it does not say

You don't go far enough back  If we believe in God and that He did create the
heavens and the earth and He did create Adam and Eve and that they walked in
the garden and history flowed from there if we can agree with that then would
you agree that the further back you go the closer you get to people who had a
stronger memory of who God was and what He said and commanded  

Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man
occurred  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual
world  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through
history  The Greek for example could say better a beggar in the land
of the living than a king in the land of the dead Iliad I think

The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is
an ever present one with Christians  I am not ready to conscign Adam
or Abraham or even Cain to eternal damnation  Yet they all died in their
sins in the Christian sense  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile
humanity and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to
him  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him through whom
Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment

In my studies
of the ancient mystery reliegions I have run across many poems or rituals or
what nots with the interpretation that those who are of God will be with Him
via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer eternal life in dieing
 It was a standard belief back then  

It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment  The
relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely
extended conditions of Greenwich mean time It is possible to imagine
an eternity of agony or bliss  or even many of them  in the
spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth

It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous
were lost This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness
that fled from us after the fall with our ever increasing involvement with
the sense world

It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient
people's ideas of life after death

                                    Today we think we know so much and that
if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two 
But I think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a
mist not those of the older ages


Mankind fell into mist and darkness and at the turning point of
time a new light entered into the world  The light still grows and
we are developing the eyes with which to see by it  Much new
revelation and growth in under standing lies before us  Our new
vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains
something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and
much more as well

At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf
Steiner founder of Anthroposophy for  many insights that have led me to my
views on this subject

I have said it before I'd love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would
fall  The history to purgatory can be shown from the druids in England to the
Greeks who pilaged it from the Egyptians who ultimately got it from the
Babylonian mysteries And yes the eastern religions also show many
similarities  I mean its black and white  THe writings and the archeological
finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this doctine  

The way you refer to it as doctrine puts a modern intellectual coloring
on it I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually
concrete a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or
teachings today can be received

I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to
simple dispersion from an original source  Even if they were passed
on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception
and experience  The similarity in the midst of great variety of
expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately
after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality  In
any case we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid
but by contemplating the principles themselves

On the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity
that originated most definitely in a pagan source  The idea that the
human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is
created at birth was consciously adopted from Aristotle whose ideas
dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does
today He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same
time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our
eternal spiritual being had grown dim

maybe at sometime in the future  

Indeed I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal
irrevocable damnation is a real possibility  But the narrow range in
which we conceive of the decisive moment ie after the end of a
single earthly life is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the
reality and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in
terms that did not try to spell it out

In article Maygenevarutgersedu you wrote

 The genius of science is that it discovered that enormous progress 
 in knowledge could be made by isolating the study of physical 
 interactions for the more general areas of study and proceeding
 not by logical argument but by experiment The scientific method
 is hypothesize attempt to disprove the hypothesis if you fail 
 publish if others fail to disprove your hypothesis accept it
 as a working theory and move on This method is suitable only
 for the study of objects without will objects which do not
 take an interest in the experiment

Science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising  One
aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses
resulting from the models produced by this thinking process

 The arrogance of science is the assumption many advocates of 
 science make that the scientific method is the only method of
 serious study the only one leading to knowledge rather than
 belief 

Science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world
It is objective

 Its further arrogance is the assumption which arises
 that since science is the only valid method of thought everything
 which exists must be the sort of thing which the scientific 
 method can study and that if the scientific method cannot 
 study it it either does not exist or cannot in any way be known

Anything which affects the physical world can be studied  For example
since we are part of the physical world anything including spirits which
affects our behaviour can be observed  Science does not make any claims
about the existence or nonexistence of objects which do not affect the
physical world

 Since these asumptions about the nature of the world cannot
 themselves be made the subject of experiment it is bad science
 to believe them as well as arrogance illogic and just plain
 sloppy thinking

The purpose of science is to produce a model of the physical world  The
model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome
of future observations  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out
well defined observations which are objective

Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world and
the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions  At the
moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual world
existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a
spiritual world  As the nonspiritual models has fewer assumptions it
should be the currently accepted models

The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the
correct ones whereas many religions claim to represent the truth  The
arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth this
cannot be said of scientists

I think you're talking about the assumption of the Blessed Virgin
Mary  It says that The Immaculate Mother of God the ever Virgin
Mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed
body and soul into heavenly glory  This was defined by a Papal
statement in  though it had certainly been believed by some
before that  Like the Immaculate Conception this is primarily a
Roman Catholic doctrine and like it it has no direct Biblical
support  Note that Catholics do not believe in sola scriptura
That is they do not believe that the Bible is the only source of
Christian knowledge  Thus the fact that a doctrine has little
Biblical support is not necessarily significant to them  They believe
that truth can be passed on through traditions of the Church and also
that it can be revealed to the Church  I'm not interested in yet
another CatholicProtestant argument but if any Catholics can tell us
the basis for these beliefs I think it would be appropriate  clh

In the Bible there are a lot of instances where God speaks
to people where a person just came to know some piece
of information where a person walks off into the desert
for  days etc With all of God's power He certainly can
do whatever He wants when He wants it The Bible ends
with the book of Revelations But does God's reign end there  No
So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer
happening or still happening 

I can now hear the clamor for proof 
With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this
group it's very hard to get the point across I'll only
go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look
at documents stored somewhere I've cited the uncorrupted
bodies of saints before They're still there 
The apparitions at Fatima Portugal culminated in a miracle
specifically granted to show God's existence That was
the spinningdescending of the sun It was seen in several
countries That event is approved by the Pope Currently
images of Mary in Japan Korea Yugoslavia Philippines Africa
are showing tears natural or blood These are still under
investigation by the Church But realize that investigations
take decades to finish And if the message is Christ will come
in ten days that's a bit too late isn't it 
Other events under investigation are inner locutions coming
to know stigmata the person exhibits Christ's wounds And
they don't heal And doctor's don't know why
Nonbelievers are welcome to pore through documents I'm sure

This stuff is not like Koresh Or Oral Roberts give me M
or God will call me home It's free Find out why they're
happening as we ourselves are studying why If anybody
can figure this out tell us  You can be of any religion
If you have the resources go to one of the countries I mentioned
These are not members only events God and Mary invites 
everybody

So in conclusion finally 
We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary
We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to
There are more proofs and events And that is why not everything
is in the Bible Although in a lot of the apparitions we are told
to read the Bible

As far as the Protestant vs Catholics issue is concerned
In the end God's churches will unite I'm not sure how
I have some idea But the point is we shouldn't worry
about the versus part Just do God's work That's all
that matters Unity will come

BTW I'm just a plain person I'm not the Pope's spokesperson
But I am RC

In article Mayathosrutgersedu toddnickellaurentianca writes
         Your roommate is correct  The Immaculate Conception refers to
 the conception of Mary in Her mother's womb  

Okay now that we've defined the Immaculate Conception Doctrine would it
be possible for those more knowledgeable in the area to give the biblically
or other support for it I've attempted to come to terms with it previously
in an attempt to understand it for learning purposes and haven't been able
to grasp the reasoning 

It was a gift from God  I think basically the reasoning was that the
tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus
As the tenets of faith developed particularly with Augustine sin was
more and more equated with sex and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin
for life since she never sinned and since she was the spouse of God etc
Since we also had this notion of original sin ie that man is born with
a predisposition to sin and since Mary did not have this predisposition
because she did not ever sin she didn't have original sin  When science
discovered the process of conception the next step was to assume that
Mary was conceived without original sin the Immaculate Conception

Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes  She 
refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception  Since a nine year old 
would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed
to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine

RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources that
being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition  In this case mostly tradition

Note I am crossposting actually emailing this to 
bitlistservcatholic while main posting goes to 
socreligionchristian

Quotations omitted  This is in response to a question about
the Immaculate Conception  I explained it but left justification
up to our Catholic readers  clh

There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the
mention of Mary's blessednessfull of grace in the Annunciation by
Angel Gabriel in Luke 

 And in the th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
 a city of Galilee named Nazareth  To a virgin espoused to a
 man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the virgin's
 name was Mary  And the angel came unto her and said Hail
 thou that art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed
 art thou among women

Now now hold that line of thought  the Lord is with Mary 
blessed art thou among women  while you read on

In the book First Lady of the World A Popular History of
Devotion to Mary by Peter Lappin

The Immaculate Conception matter is really far more complicated
than the Assumption  This arose in  AD  It is quite possible
that the feast of Mary's Conception under the title The Conception
of Saint Anne originally commemorated the physical miracle of
a woman beyond the age of child bearing conceiving a daughter
just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist  A transfer in
emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle
of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was logical  Mary
is the incorruptible timber out of which was hewn the tabernacle
of Christ's sinless body she is God's Eden in whom there is
no tree of knowledge and no serpent that harms  Her perfect
beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ her
purity in that of the Father  At the time of the Council of Ephesus
she was hailed as innocent without blemish immaculate inviolate
spotless holy in soul and body who was blessed as a lily from
among thorns unlearned in the evil ways of Eve

At the end of the thirteenth century an Irish Franciscan
John Duns Scotus God maintained that it was a 
greater thing for Him to preserve His the Son mother from all
sin than to use His power to clease her from it later


Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin
From Pocket Catholic Cathechism by John A Hardon

Baptism 
Concupiscence Remains after Baptism
Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized
but since it is left to provide trial it has no power to
injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of
Christ Jesus manfully resist Canon 

Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall
In the light of the foregoing we see that our first
parents were originally gifted three times over
They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the
 power to think and to choose freely
The had the preternatural gifts of bodily immortality
 and of integrity or the internal power to control desires
They had the supernatural gifts of sanctifying grace
 the virtues of faith hope and charity and the corresponding
 title to enter heaven
By their disobedience they lost the supernatural and
preternatural gifts entirely and were weakened without
losing their natural capacity to reason and to choose
freely

Baptism restores the supernatural life lost by Adam's
sin  It does not restore the preternatural gifts
but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our
bodies on the last day

Going back to Immaculate Conception
I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other
books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'

Given the miracle of St Anne bearing a child at a
nonchildbearing age AND Christ was not yet born 
AND there was no baptism yet on Mary's birth but
STILL the Angel Gabriel's greetings was
Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with you
Blessed art thou amongst women

Even Mary was confused about this greeting

Mary could very well have possessed all of the
treefold original gifts above given to our first
parents Adam and Eve before their sin
    Hail Mary Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel
    Full of grace natural preternatural supernatural
    The Lord is with you At those times God would
                definitely want to be with those He
                has made blessed
    Blessed art thou amongst women that says it all

At the conception God made Mary full of grace
and blessed as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body
of Christ and so

Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still
has maintained her Immaculate Heart 

Marida
PS  I do hope that others will continue more
       light and facts on this matter  Thanks

A  BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  ABOUT  AHMADIYYA  ISLAM



        The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam an international organi
sation was found in  in Qadian India The founder of this
movement Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad  was proclaimed to 
be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures
of almost all major religions of the world He claimed to be the 
fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ
metaphorically the Muslim Mahdi and the Promised Messiah

        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and
extreme opposition which are often witnessed in the history of 
divine reformers Even today this sect is being persecuted especial
ly in some of the Muslim regimes The right of Ahmadi Muslims to 
openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims
has been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries The United
Nations human rights organizations such as Amnesty International
and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns 
against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the
members of this movement but so far to no avail

        Despite the opposition and persecution the movement cont
inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the
world in over  countries who come from diverse ethnic and cul
tural backgrounds

        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards
developing a better understanding of all religions Ahmadi Muslims
have always been opposed to all forms of violence bigotry reli
gious intolerance and fundamentalism

        Among its many philanthropic activities the sect has es
tablished a network of hundreds of schools hospitals and clinics
in many third world countries These institutions are staffed by
volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's
internal resources The movement stresses the importance of educa
tion and leadership Its members have included a high number of
professionals as well as world class individuals

        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral
reform establish peace and justice and to unite mankind under
one universal brotherhood

 Following Jesus Christ has everything to do with sharing in
 his work and spreading the news that the Kingdom of Heaven is already
 among us  Fearbased religion is not a faithrelationship with the
 One Who made us all

So does that mean that anyone who is a Christian to avoid Hell isn't really
a Christian at all It sounds like it to me

 Here's a question that some friends and I were debating last night
 Q If you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that
    unbelievers simply remained dead would you remain a Christian

      Reasoning pertinent to believing Xians deleted for space

      It strikes me for no apparent reason that this is reversible
Ie if I had proof that there existed a hell in which I would be
eternally punished for not believing in life would that make me a Xian
pardon my language Bloodyhellno

      Of course being merely a reversal of your thinking this
doesn't add anything new to the debate but

 Several friends disagreed arguing the fear of hell was necessary
 to motivate people to Christianity To me that fatally undercuts the
 message that God is love

      A point very well taken IMNSHO

   about tongues  

 The concept of tongues as used at Pentecost seems an outdated concept
 now  With the Bible available in nearly every language and missionaries
 who are out there in ALL languages why does the church need tongues

I guess there are at least some people who are not able to support
this claim There are still a lot of languages without the Bible or a
part of the Bible There are still many languages which we are not
able to write simply because the written version of the language has
not yet been defined

I guess this is one of the main goals for Wycliffe Bible Translators
To define rules and a grammar for writing the 'rest' of the languages
of this world I do not see that any of them will have any reason to
become unemployed during the foreseeable future Provided they get
their neccessary support And still they are one of the  largest
missionary organizations of the world

I have to reject your argument here  The Spirit speaks with one
voice and he does not contradict himself  

The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired
by the Spirit ie Godbreathed  It is a test which is more
guided by faith than by reason or logic  The early church decided
that the Apocrypha did not meet this testeven though some books
such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses  For example
the Lutheran hymn Now Thank We All Our God quotes a passage
from this book

The deuterocanonical books were added much later in the church's
history  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of Scripture  I do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the Spirit in so doing  And that is where
this sort of discussion ultimately ends

Just an observation although the bodily assumption has no basis in
the Bible Carl Jung declared it to be one of the most important
pronouncements
of the church in recent years in that it implied the inclusion of the 
feminine into the Godhead

Which means he has absolutely no idea about what the Assumption is

However greatly we extoll Mary it is quite obvious that she is in no
way God or even part of God or equal to God  The Assumption of our
Blessed Mother meant that because of her close identification with the
redemptive work of Christ she was Assumed note that she did not
ASCEND body and soul into Heaven and is thus one of the few along
with Elijah Enoch Moses maybe who are already perfected in
Heaven  Obviously the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to
any of the previously mentioned personages

Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology

Gerry Palo writes

  there is nothing in Christianity that precludes the idea of
  repeated lives on earth

The Apostle Paul Romans  points out that God chose Jacob
rather than Esau to be the ancestor of the Covenant People and
ultimately of the Messiah and that He made this choice while the
two boys were still in their mother's womb and therefore could not
possibly have done anything good or evil to deserve their appointed
destinies If we admit the possibility that they had lived previous
lives and that in accordance with the Asiatic idea of karma
their present lives are a reward or punishment for past behaviour
this makes nonsense of Paul's whole point


The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny karma does not
mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds
There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction but I
did not subscribe to that view  God may choose one individual over
another as the fit instrument for his plans but that does not
preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in
this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development

I do not and Rudolf Steiner did not subscribe to the oriental view
of an inexorable mechanistic karma determining everything that
befalls one  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater
law in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the
ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of
Christ can be seen as the master theme and indeed a new impulse that
was completely free of karma  Christ incarnated only once in the
flesh and in that he had no debt of karma or sin  The oriental
concepts of reincarnation and karma which are even more trivialized
and mechanized in some new age teachings incorrectly assume Jesus
Christ to have been the reincarnation of a master  avatar etc
Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the
continuing individuality from one life to the next eg Buddhism
More important they have no concept of the resurrection of the body
the ultimate continuity of the whole human being  to ultimate
resurrection and judgement on the Last Day

There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing It is the
tenth chapter of John devoted almost entirely to the man born blind
Clearly here Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma
or that of his parents that led to his blindness but rather that a
new impulse is to be revealed through him  But note that he does not
refute the disciples' question  In fact they ask it as a matter of
course the question being stated as if it were self evident that only
one of two possibilities existed  it was either the sins of the man
himself obviously not in this incarnation or the sins of his
parents  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at
all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of
Christ's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it

There is also Matthew  where Jesus says straight out about John
the Baptist

   If you care to accept it he himself is Elias who was to come

This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching
either way about reincarnation  or in fact about what happens to
the human being at all between death and the Last Day  Even Jesus did
not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it If
you care to accept it  So I took care to point out not that the
Bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either and
that much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes
understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way  I
pointedly used repeated earth lives to distinguish a little from the
oriental doctrines usually associated with the word reincarnation
The phrase is Rudolf Steiner's wiederholte Erdenleben  He noted too
that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west completely
free from eastern tradition  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries the most important expression of it being Lessing's The
Education of the Human Race

To return to your original point Paul's statement about Jacob and
Esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma
And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the
incarnation death and resurrection ascension and return of Jesus
Christ in my view

I believe that the God has preserved the Bible perfectly in that it
perfectly conveys all of the truth that He intended This He has done

Oh yea  Which version of the Bible is the perfectly preserved one  And
why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved  Is
God trying to confuse us

Minor changes in wording or even accidental omission of passages in some
manuscripts does not change the truth being conveyed nor would it lead a
serious student into doctrinal error Note also that God provided many

But that is exactly what happend  There are so many branches of 
denominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding
from varying translations of biblical texts by serious students that
are much too numerous to begin to count  If there is a Perfect Bible
then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be
no need for anyone here to be debating it  On the other hand maybe
the Bible is perfect but no one on this planet is perfect enough to
read it correctly but then there would be no point in God giving us
something we cannot use correctly

In short if you attack the credibility and reliability of the Bible you
are on weak ground Furthermore the only reason that I can see for wanting
to do so is to remove the Bible as the final authority and instead put
that responsibility on men to sift the Bible to strain out the nuggets of
truth that it contains in other words what they want to believe and
ignore the rest The Bible IS Truth it does not just contain truth

IMHO if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book
you are on weak ground  Remember In the beginning was the Word and
the Word was with God and the Word was God  This Word existed BEFORE
the Bible was written  Note Word  God  This Word that John is
trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language
all languages being IMPERFECT  Realization comes only from contemplation
of the Word and is outside the boundaries of language  I use the Bible
as a guide a stepping stone but in no way is it my final authority
God alone is the final authority

I hope that anyone who remembers seeing Rev Troy Perry's
performance at the  March On Washington will see for themselves
just how inconceivable it is to mix Christianity with homosexuality

 Whether or not Christianity and homosexuality are compatible is clearly
 debatable since it IS being debated  In my opnion it is genuinely
 destuctive to the cause of Christianity to use this sort of ad hominem
 argument to oppose one's adversaries  It only serves to further drive
 people away from Christianity because it projects and confirms the
 frequently held opinion that Christians are unable to think critically
 and intelligently 

I agree entirely  Speaking as an atheist heterosexual for what it's
worth this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of
Christianity  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically
that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis
of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
morally the case looks unanswerable for those outside religion the
three forms are analogous we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of
sex race or sexual orientation

I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive and recommend
everyone to read them

There seem to be three different levels of acceptance

 Regard homosexual orientation as a sin or evil whatever
 Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin but accept orientation
though presumably orientation is unfortunate and dislike people who
indulge
 As  but love the sinner
 Accept homosexuality altogether

My experience is that  is the most common attitude I imagine  and 
are limited to a few fundamentalist sects

I suppose I can go along with  except that I have this feeling that
a  year old living in a community with this attitude on
discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex
would not feel the love of the community but would rather feel the
pressure not to exhibit their feelings  I'm not saying that the
community in particular the parents would not love the child but I
suspect the child would not feel loved

I have a simple test I take several people who can speak
only one language eg chinese russian german english
Then I let the gifted one start speaking in toungues
The audience should understand the gifted one clearly
in their native language However the gifted one can
only hear himself speaking in his own language

That would be neat but nowhere in the Bible does it say
that one who has the gift of tounges can do this  If the gift
of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone
no matter what languages they know there would be no need for the
gift of interpretation and I Corinthians  would not have had to
have been written 


Perhaps I would believe the gifted ones more if they were
glorifying God rather than themselves Then perhaps we'd
witness a real miracle

That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million
Christians world wide  Sure there are some who want glory
for themselves who speak in tounges just as there are among those
who do not have this gift  There were people like this in the Corinthian
church also  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all
who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men  
I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges 
do so more often in private prayer than in public

There were apparently those in the early church who claimed that
at Pentecost the miracle was that the crowd were all given the

Undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons but I suspect that a biggie
is that the God they've believed in is in JB Phillips's words too small 
If a person's understanding of God is not allowed to grow and develop it will
eventually become inadequate  The greyhaired gentleman on a throne who was a
comforting image in childhood becomes a joke

A therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they fire
God  What she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of
God to make room for a fuller one  But she follows up by encouraging them to
hire a new one  My guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing
process but are not adequately supported in the subsequent rehire

In article Maygenevarutgersedu
sunGerryPalouunetuunet Gerry Palo writesBetween Adam and Eve and
Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man
occurred  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual
world  

This was precisely my point  From a theological bent those who lived
immediately after the flood such as Noah Ham his son Cush and his son
Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath  They also had a
stronger understanding of the True God  In fact this immediacy was a cause of
hardship for some so much so that Atlas who is seen with heavens resting on
his shoulders  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting
 It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance and
thus he became the Elevator of the heavens  This god made men able to
feel as if heaven were afar off and as if either the God of Heaven could not
see through the dark cloud or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of
His laws  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled Emancipator
or Deliverer  or Phoroneus It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system
and abridged the liberties of mankind yet was worship for having given many
benefits  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a
Deliverer  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath the other
actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it
as true

The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is
an ever present one with Christians  I am not ready to consign Adam
or Abraham or even Cain to eternal damnation

I don't see the problem  From the time of Adam those who looked forward to
the coming Anointed One and put their faith in the fact that it was God who
was to do the provision were accounted as righteous  But up to the
Crucifixion their sins were only covered not taken away  Therefore the
dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same but see it
as a completed action  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation
via faith and nothing else

It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment  The
relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely
extended conditions of Greenwich mean time 

I understand what you're trying to convey but I don't think I'd lay hold of it
because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the
eternality of say the Church ruling with Christ  Jn  tells us what eternal
life is exactly as you are correct that it is much more than noncessation of
consciousness  

It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous
were lost 

It depends upon your def of lost  The elect were lost only in time as
outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world 
Existentially we were all born lost but the righteous were in Christ and
therefore never assuredly lost  

It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient
people's ideas of life after death

Maybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it  I simply
have to buy more books for myself and these older books are very expensive 
Either that or countless trips to the oriental museum

Mankind fell into mist and darkness and at the turning point of
time a new light entered into the world  The light still grows and
we are developing the eyes with which to see by it  Much new
revelation and growth in under standing lies before us  Our new
vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains
something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and
much more as well


Couldn't agree with you more  Our understanding of say eschatology is
clearly clearer than that of say Isaiah  But that is not what I was referring
to

At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf
Steiner founder of Anthroposophy for  many insights that have led me to my
views on this subject

The way you refer to it as doctrine puts a modern intellectual coloring
on it I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually
concrete a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or
teachings today can be received

No I understand it as you have said This was my point


I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to
simple dispersion from an original source  Even if they were passed
on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception
and experience 

Ah  This is it  This is the big question  However I would say again I
think that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it 
Look at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve  That is a very
interesting study

 The similarity in the midst of great variety of
expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately
after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality

Yes that is my point  But it is a two edged sword For some do not want the
underlying reality to be revealed  They were not known as mystery religions
for no reason  There was the public side of them and there was the private
side that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they
revealed that private side  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings
to light The Mystery of Iniquity that we find in the Bible correlates to
this I think  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately
little by little under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath what it would
not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion  Case in point
today might be the Masons  Just a note that they too worshipped Osiris in
Egypt who can be traced to Nimrod the husband son

On the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity
that originated most definitely in a pagan source  The idea that the
human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is
created at birth was consciously adopted from Aristotle whose ideas
dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does
today

No I disagree with you here Gerry  I know what you're alluding to in that the
church primarily the RCC did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their
worldview but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece  If you
are a student of history you will come to see that much of what Greece came to
expound to the world as their original was just an adulteration of that which
they had taken from conquered countries  The soul is clearly mentioned and
discussed at length in the Egyptian religions As was the unity of God and also
the trinity of God  See if you can find Wilkinson's Egyptians  He really
does a number on what the Greeks did to what they pilfered from the
Egyptians 

 He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same
time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our
eternal spiritual being had grown dim

I'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker  Its just that
there is nothing new under the sun


Indeed I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal
irrevocable damnation is a real possibility  But the narrow range in
which we conceive of the decisive moment ie after the end of a
single earthly life is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the
reality and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in
terms that did not try to spell it out

Each age has its own focus of theology  The early church struggled with the
Trinitarian formulation  The reformation dealt with authority  Today
eschatology has had much study  The early creeds do not spell these things out
in detail because  they weren't the topic of concern  there was
insufficient wisdom accumulated  they didn't have the exegetical tools that
we have today  Also each age seems to have an air of revelation to it  One
age has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is
given growth  It would be natural for the end of times to have the garden
appropriate for the growth of eschatology wouldn't it

Hello src readers

Again the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox
Churches believe in Monophysitism pops up again We had a discussion
about it a while ago 

In article Maygenevarutgersedu dbnandrewcmuedu D Andrew Byler writes

The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism  This was a
heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in  AD  It
grew up in reaction to Nestorianism which held that the Son and Jesus
are two different people who happened to be united in the same body
temporarily  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia
and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox 

Then OFM comments 



These issues get mighty subtle  When you see people saying different
things it's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously
different things or whether they are using different terminology  I
don't think there's any question that there is a problem with
Nestorius and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form
without a real human nature or will is heretical  But I'd like to be
a bit wary about the Copts Armenians etc  Recent discussions
suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from
orthodoxy as many had thought 

With my appreciation to the moderator I believe that further elaboration
is needed This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue

Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople as opposed
to the western empire of Rome the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played
leading roles in  Christian theology  They were  invited everywhere to speak
about the Christian faith St Cyril Pope of Alexandria was the head of the
Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year  AD It was said
that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their
time in meetings This leading role however did not fare well when politics
started to intermingle with  Church affairs  It all started when the Emperor
Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church The response of St
Dioscorus the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled to this interference
was clear You have nothing to do with the Church  These political motives
became even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in  when the Coptic  Church  was
unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches who believed  in
monophysitism This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only
one nature the divine not two natures the human as well as the divine

The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was
portrayed in the Council of Chalcedon  In  that Council monophysitism meant
believing in one  nature  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His
divinity  and He   is perfect in  His humanity  but  His  divinity  and His
humanity were united in one nature called the nature of the incarnate word
which was reiterated by St Cyril of Alexandria  Copts thus believe in two
natures human and   divine  that are   united in   one without mingling
without confusion and without alteration from the  declaration of faith at
the end of the Coptic divine liturgy  These  two  natures did not separate
for a moment or the twinkling of an eye also from  the declaration of faith
at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy

The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the th century  at the  Council  of
Chalcedon  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly but  they
wanted to exile the  Church   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian
independent Pope Despite  all of this  the Coptic Church  has remained very
strict  and steadfast in its faith   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the
Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal
to be politically influenced or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the
extra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite the Coptic
Church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile semantic differences between
all  Christian  Churches   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  th
successor  of  St Mark Pope Shenouda III  To the  Coptic Church faith is
more  important  than  anything and   others  must know that  semantics  and
terminology are of  little importance to us  Throughout this  century  the
Coptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement The
Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches It has
remained a member of that  council  since  AD   The Coptic Church is  a
member  of the all  African Council of Churches  AACC  and the  Middle East
Council of  Churches MECC  The Church    plays an  important role   in the
Christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the
theological differences with the  Catholic Greek Orthodox Presbyterian and
Evangelical Churches



As a final note the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign
a common statement of Christology in which the heresey of Monophysitism
was condemned So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in
Monophysitism

As I mentioned in a brief apology the comment quoted above from me
is confused  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite  As
Andrew Byler correctly stated it the Nestorians and monophysites were
actually opposite parties  The point I was making which Nabil
explains in some detail is that some groups that have been considered
heretical probably aren't

Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups the Alexandrians and
Antiochenes  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable
to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes  I agree
that there were extremes that were heretical  However in the course
of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got
rejected who didn't intend heresy but simply used language that was
not understood or even was mispresented  And some seem not to have
jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine  There are
groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps  This
posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians  There are also
a remaining Nestorians  Like some of the current socalled
monophysites there is reason to believe that the current socalled
Nestorians are not heretical either  They sheltered Nestorius from
what they saw as unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his
heresies and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of
the Antiochene tradition

 Much deletion  He is trying to explain the Immaculate Conception

	'Original sin' is the only reason fallen humanity

If this is true than why in the Genesis story is God concerned that
Adam and Eve might also eat from the Tree of Life and live forever and
be like gods  Eating of the tree of life would not take away the
effects of eating of the Tree of Knowledge  Is there any reason to
assume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had
already attained to eternal life  If so what basis is there for
saying that this was taken away from them  To me the wages of sin are
a spiritual death not necessarily a physical death  I
can attest to the truth of this interpretation from my own experience
I suspect that many others could attest to this as well

Mark Ashley's account of private revelation does not as some might
think contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church
believes that public revelation on which Catholic doctrine is based
ended with the death of St John the last Apostle  In that posting
I made sure I used the word public  Public revelation contains
God's truth intended for everyone to believe  The revelation contained
in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation  Private
revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual  He may speak
directly to the individual He may send an angel or He may send the
Virgin Mary or some lesser saint  The only person who is required to
believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed
Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations
but doctrines can not

When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention the
Church may investigate it  If the investigation indicates a likelihood
that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God it will be
approved  That means that it can be preached in the Church  However
it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from
God  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most
well attested and strongly approved private revelations such as those
at Fatima and Lourdes  I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject
Fatima and Lourdes but if any do their rejection of them does not
mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing

I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in
evaluating an alleged private revelationit's not something I need
every daybut I know that one of the primary requirements is that
nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything
known through public revelation

 pwhiteemproscom Peter White relates a story about a person who 
gives a message in tongues which consists entirely of the words pu'
ka  He was asked to refrain from doing that


Well Brother Puka controlled himself for a while but a few weeks
later the church had invited a missionary in to speak At the time of
the meeting where tongues and interpretation were appropriate who 
should arise to speak but Brother Puka And off he went as before
all the words were Puka The pastor was about to apologize for this
embarrassment when the missionary arose to speak saying that he
was sorry that he did not have the interpretation but that he could
give the translation In a tribe where he had worked they only had
one word in the language puka Meaning was derived from the inflection
and other voice qualities Brother Puka had given a perfectly inflected
and reasonable message

Nice story but it sets off my urban legend or is it charismatic
legend alarms  Can the linguists on the net identify the language
from the description  Or can they even attest that such a language
exists  It seems to be odd enough at least by the standards of
European languages that if it exists it should be reasonably well
known to linguists as an extreme case of something or other

Or have I just overreacted to your basic shaggy dog story

As the moderator noted I think you mean the Assumption  Catholics
believe that the Blessed Virgin Mary went to Heaven body and soul at
the end of her life  This is unusual because the normal course of
events is for your body to decay in the grave and stay that way until
the Resurrection of the Dead

Well it wasn't that way for Enoch and Elijah both of whom were
translated directly into heaven  It's beyond my grasp why some object
that Mary who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah should not
benefit from the same privelege they recieved  She was after all
Mother of God full of grace and immaculate

Historically belief in the Assumption can be found in the writings of
St Gregory of Tours late th century

And in St Germain of Constantinople and St John of Damascus and in
St Andrew of Crete among others

And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria
also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation even though they
broke away from the unity of the Chruch in  AD by rejecting the
Council of Chalcedon  It might be argued by some Protestants that the
Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up but the Monophysites put a
big hole in that notion as they also hold the belief and they split
from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing as
far as is known much has been lost from the time of the Fathers

Do you mean that your fellow Christians tend to find you wacky  Maybe  
they're right  You might be interested in Franky Schaeffer's books  
about what philistines American Christians are Addicted to  
Mediocrity and more recently Sham Pearls for Real Swine

One day a few years ago Franky Schaeffer walked into a Greek Orthodox
Church  He is now an Orthodox Christian  So is his mother and if his
father Fransis Schaeffer had not passed away he too would have come
into the church  
Franky like many Americans who have recently found the Orthodox church
described the experience as finally coming home after a long jouney
through a desert  You should also read the book Becoming Orthodox by
Peter Gillquist  It describes the long journey of some  weary
Evangelical Protestants to the Orthodox church   Come taste and see how
good the Lord is

Michael Bushnell writes

The socalled Creed of Athanasius however has always been a Western
creed and has always had the filioque  The Orthodox have said that
they accept all that it says with the exception of the filioque but
it is not in use

Which is exactly what I pointed out  Though I was wrong about your use
of the Creed the  Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it
said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque  Apparently that
has changed  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque the
Nicene  Constantinopolitan did not
	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene
Creed it wasn't there to begin with but they certainly did from the
Athanasian Creed which did have it from the beginning
	I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in
ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity the East
emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father
through the Son and the West using proceeding from the Father and the
Son  In fact some such as Tertullian used both formulations see
below

	Following therefore the form of these examples I profess that I do
call God and His Word  the Father and and His Son  two  For the
root and the stem are two things but conjoined the fountain and the
river are two kinds but indivisible the sun and the ray are two forms
but coherent ones  Anything which proceeds from another must
necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds but it is not on
that account separated from it  Where there is second however there
are two and where ther is third there are three  The Spirit then is
third from God and the Son just as the third from the root is the fruit
of the stem and third from the fountain is the stream from the river
and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray
	Tertullian Against Praxeas   about  AD

and

	I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father
through the Son
	Tertullian Against Praxeas   about  AD

And as St Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part  Question 
Articles  and  there is no contradiction between the two methods of
generation and in fact the two methods of reckoning the procession
emphasize what St Augustine among others taught that the Holy Spirit
proceeds from the Father and the Son but He proceeds from the Father in
a more preeminent way

	For whatever the Son has He has from the Father certainly He has it
from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him  For the
Father alone is not from another for which reason He alone is called
unbegotten not indeed in the Scriptures but in the practice of
theologians and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a
matter so great  The Son however is born of the Father and the Holy
Spirit proceeds principally from the Father and since the Father gives
to the Son all that He has without any interval of time the Holy Spirit
proceeds jointly from both Father and Son  He would be called Son of
the Father and of the Son if which is abhorent to everyone of sound
mind they had both begotten Him  The Spirit was not begotten by each
however but proceeds from each and both
	St Augustine of Hippo The Trinity     to  AD

So in a sense all of the formulations are correct to the West at
least because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son but
in proceeding from the Son the orgin of that procession is the
procession from the Father so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the
Father through the Son but as all that the Son has is from the Father
the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father without any
mention of the Son being necessary
	In any case I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope
St Leo I St Fulgence of Ruspe St Cyril of Alexandria Pope St
Damsus I St Augustine of Hippo St Epiphanius of Salamis St Ambrose
of Milan St Hilary of Poitiers Tertullian and others among the
Fathers who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic
position which I enunciated above
	As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden I
will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke
of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone to produce
write or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by
the Fathers of Nicea  That Creed is a different Creed than that of
Constantinople which is commonly called the Nicene Creed  Not of
course in that they were condemning the adoption of the
Constantinopolitan Creed which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of
Nicea but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious
who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the
Church which among other things denied the procession of the Holy
Spirit form the Son  Thus the additions of the Constantinopolitan
Creed were not thought to be in violation of this and as the Council
Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy
Spirit from the Son which Nestorius denied they could hardly have been
against explaining in a fuller way the Creed for they themselves
approved of previous additions to it  And if the further explanations
of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work
done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical it follows
that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed
by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians
in Spain because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until
many years later under Photius and others  And that the filioque was
not disputed I provide more quotes below

	Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to
God and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son it is abundantly
clear that He is of the divine essence in it in essence and proceeding
from it
	St Cyril of Alexandria The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial
Trinity Thesis   AD

	The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only or of the Son only but he
is the Spirit of the Father and the Son  For it is written If anyone
loves the world the Spirit of the Father is not in him' and again it
is written If anyone however does not have the Spirit of Christ he
is none of His'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way the
Holy Spirit is understood of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel
that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father' and that He shall
receive of mine and shall announce it to you'
	Pope St Damasus I The Decree of Damasus   AD

	The onlybegotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the
appelation of Father but is called Holy Spirit and is not foreign to
the Father  For the Onlybegotten Himself calls Him the Spirit of the
Father' and says of Him the He proceeds from the Father' and will
receive of mine' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the
Son but is of their same substance of the same Godhead He is Spirit
divine  of God and He is God  For he is Spirit of God Spirit of
the Father and Spirit of the Son not by some kind of synthesis like
soul and body in us but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father
and of the Son a third by appelation
	The Father always existed and the Son always existed and the Spirit
breathes from the Father and the Son and neither is the Son created nor
is the Spirit created
	St Epiphanius of Salamis which is on Cyprus The Man WellAnchored
 and   AD

	Concerning the Holy Spirit I ought not to remain silent nor yet is
it necessary to speak  Still on account of those who do not know Him
it is not possible for me to be silent  However it is necessary to
speak of Him who must be acknowledged who is from the Father and the
Son His Sources
	St Hilary of Poitiers The Trintiy    to  AD

	Thus as I have pointed out before Gaul Spain Italy Africa Egypt
Palastine and the lands of the Greeks all of Christnedom at that time
all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine
expressed by the filioque  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church
that they come up with some of the Fathers besides St John of Damascus
who all will admit denied the filioque to support their views  It is
not enough to bring up the proceeds from the Father line of the Creed
or the Gospel of John for that says what we believe also  But it does
not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son only that He does
proceed from the Father

Let me tell you my story
I grew up catholic Up until I was  it wasn't an issue for me Then I met
a bornagain christian a very sweet person not proseletyzingsp not 
imposing I tried to get into being as christian as I could as I felt I 
'should'

But the more I tried the more depressed I got I felt guilty for some of my
own personal honest feelings I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict
until I was 

Then I taught myself to think rationally I read a lot of books pro and con 
religion in general and specifically catholicism I came to a crisis point
then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist 

This is a very loose explanation but it's the gist of it

Now at  I feel better about myself better selfesteem a generally 
stronger person I have welldefined goals I have a strong and stable sense 
of morals and values I am not a neonazi or a corrupt politicain etc I 
believe in human rights and 'live and let live' among other things I am very 
antiviolent and antihatred This is to debunk the myth that atheists are
depraved
Religion has no place in my system
Tough

Bertrand Russell said that we cannot know god doesn't exist we can't prove 
it So in that sense we can only truly be agnostic But for all practical
purposes there is no god

 Jesus truthfully

        If you look at the geneology of Christ in Luke  and the one in
Matthew  you will notice that they trace different lines back to David
I have been told that one traces Mary's line back to David and the other
traces Joseph's line back to David  Both of them go beyond David in
history  Acording to some of my Jewish friends Jewishness is passed
to a child by the mother and the legal rights of Jewishness are passed
through the father  If it is true that one of these geneologies is
Mary's then Christ's bloodline is from David through His mother  This
also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of
David as according to at least Roman law and possibly Mosaic law as
well but I am not sure Joseph was Christ's LEGAL FATHER

The argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak According
to Luke 

   And when he began his ministry Jesus himself was about 
   thirty years of age being supposedly the son of Joseph
   the son of Eli

Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned there are two possible
interpretations either Joseph was her father or he was her brother
Clearly this is not acceptable  A third would be that Joseph the son
of Eli was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man
to whom she was betrothed But that would seem to be grasping at
straws The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no
intention of tracing Mary's genealogy in which case he would have
named her but that he traces her husband's from David's son Nathan

The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's
son Solomon to Joseph  Matthew  reads

   And to Jacob was born Joseph the husband of Mary by whom was born
   Jesus who is called Christ 

There are two apparent problems  The first is how to reconcile the
two paternal genealogies  which diverge with the sons of David
Solomon and Nathan  The second is why is any genealogy of Joseph
relavent at all if Joseph had nothing to do with it  If Joseph was
not Jesus's physical father then the original poster is quite
correct that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on
truth but only on appearances whatever Jesus's divine nature was

The second problem is easy in my mind  We assume that Joseph was not
involved in the conception of Jesus in any way  However a Holy
Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also
capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this
work  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss
solely in terms of a physical act whereas it is really a matter of
purity on a much higher level as well  The important thing is that
neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them they
had not knowneach other  Thus the first gospel's dedication of
half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant
to Jesus the Virgin birth not withstanding

To the first question there is an answer that creates to begin with more
problems than it resolves  It is that the two evangelists are relating 
the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different
sets of parents  Except for the names of the parents and the child and 
the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two 
stories  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years
later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan  Rudolf Steiner offered his
explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge
with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth  He did not derive his
resolution from biblical study or speculation or from other external
documents and the discussion of how this could be might bring us beyond
the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup  In any case the
details are described in Steiner's The Spiritual Guidance of the Human 
Being and of Humanity The Gospel of St Luke and The Gospel of St
Matthew 

Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted
as valid at least this interpretation resolves the apparent
contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact

As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother this was
never an issue with Jesus No one ever questioned his or Mary's
Jewishness  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal
line of descent from David the king

 Imagine the worst depth of despair you've

 Some people suffer such emotional physical and mental anguish
 in their lives that their deaths seem to be merciful But at least
 the pain does end in death What if you lived a hundred such lives
 at the conclusion of one you were instantly reborn into another
 What if you lived a million a billion years in this state
 What if this kept going forever


Did this happen to Jesus I don't think so not from what I heard He lived
ONE DAY of suffering and died If the wages of sin is the above paragraph then
JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS DID HE

You might visit some congregations of Christians who happen to be homosexuals
that are spiritfilled believers 

Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior
A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs  Jesus said
that people would come to Him saying Lord Lord and proclaiming
the miraculous works they had done in His name  Jesus would tell
them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him and to
depart from Him  

That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual
sin  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect He would
not be given to me or any of us  God can forgive any sin if we repent
But people should be careful not to think God has given me a gift of
the Spirit it must be okay to be gay  That is dangerous see also hebrews
 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of 
the world to come

The Lord IS working in our community the homosexual community that is  He's
not asking us to change our sexual nature

Jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature  We cannot lift ourselves
out of our own sin but we must submit to His hand as He changes our
nature  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the
morality that God has set forth  

If you don't believe that and think those of us who do are just ignorant
then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's
Is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul whether it be the
homosexual's or the one considered ignorant

One thing I don't understand is why being sacred should make the

On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they
should not be spoken of in a common manner or trampled under
feet such as the Lords name is today  The ceremonies are
performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside
as being as sacredholyuncommon place  We believe that the 
ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they
are viewed with the right spirit which in this case is in the
temple  So from our point of view when they are brought
out into the public they are being trampled under feet
because of misinterpretations and mocking and it is therefore
offensive to us

Please do not assume that because of my use of the words
'we' and 'our' that I'm an official spokesman for the LDS
church  I am merely stating what I believe is the general
feeling among us  Others feel free to disagree

   Just a quick question If Mary was Immaculately concieved so she
   could be a pure vessel does this mean that she was without sin
   and therefore the perfect meaning sinless female human being
   Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite
   it's basically patriarchical structure

She was immaculately conceived and so never subject to Original Sin
but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life  This was
possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God

She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God
and everything that flows from that relationship

The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve  The Fathers in the
early Church use this particular figure a lot

Eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense  Mary is the
mother of all the living in the order of grace  As sin came through
Eve so Grace  Jesus Christ  came through Mary

evil result of human sinfulness rather than the will of God
In a certain sense yes  But in the sense that God allows evil to
happen when obviously He being God He could have not had it happen
does in a certain sense mean that He wills it to happen  God does not
condone evil but instead uses it for good as you say however what
God desires must be seperated from what actually happens  For example
God desires that all should be saved  Timothy  however it is
quite obvious that nowhere near all are saved  Was God's will thwarted
 No because His will cannot be escaped for even when it appears that
it is your will doing something it is actually the will of God which by
His grace has disposed us to do as He wishes  So we come to the age old
question why does evil occur  To which we must answer that God allows
evil to occur though He does not condone it so that His ultimate plan
may be brought to sucess  Personally I suggest reading the parts of
the Summa Theologica of St Thomas that deal with the knowledge of God
to get a good grasp on this whole idea

whoo  i'm going to have to be very careful with my language here  i
think God is voluntarily giving up his omniscience in this world so
that we can decide on our own where we go  free will  in this sense
God allows evil to occur and in this sense can be held responsible
as my chaplain says  however his will is of course that all be
saved  he's not going to save us by himself  we have to take a
step in his direction before he will save us  read that last sentence
carefully  i'm not saying we save ourselves  i'm saying we have to
ACCEPT our salvation  i do not believe in predestination  it would
appear from what you say further down that you do  

stuff deleted
I am not saying that anyone deserves punishment more than someone else
I am simply pointing out that God could be using the Serbians and
Croatians as instruments of His punishment as he did with the
Israelites against the Cannanites

ok  i have trouble with that but i guess that's one of those things
that can't be resolved by argument  i accept your interpretation

more deleted
The issue is not questioning why God has made the world in the way God
so chooses it is whether I am discerning the world in the way God
intends it  The debate is about whether we should not oppose the Serbians
in their ethnic cleansing because they might be doing the will of God

And I said Christians should not be participants in such wars and
slaughters That does not mitigate the fact that God allows this evil to
continue for He is patient and willing that none should perish so He
waits for those whom He has foreknown to turn to Him from their evil
			     
this is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination
am i correct  i do not believe in predestination  i believe we all
choose whether or not we will accept God's gift of salvation to us
again fundamental difference which can't really be resolved

I am not saying that the evil befalling the Bosnians is justified by
their guilt  I am saying that it is possible that God is punishing them

Bosnians though they may very well be guilty of great sins but that is
up to God to judge  We are all defendants when the time comes for our
judgement by God  Let us all sincerely hope and pray that we will have
Jesus Christ as our advocate at that judgement

yes it is up to God to judge  but he will only mete out that
punishment at the last judgement  as for now evil can be done by
human beings that is NOT God's will  and the best we can do is see
taht some good comes out of it somehow  the thing that most worries
me about the it is the will of God argument is that this will
convince people that we should not STOP the rape and killing when i
think that it is most christlike to do just that  if jesus stopped
the stoning of an adulterous woman perhaps this is not a good
parallel but i'm going to go with it anyway why should we not stop
the murder and violation of people who may or may not be more
innocent

If the original message claims that marriage is not discussed in the
Bible I have to disagree  Various aspects of marriage are discussed
in some of Paul's letters Ephesians  sees marriage as a symbol of
God's relationship with the church  If it means specifically that the
marriage ceremony isn't described then that seems to be true  But I
think what most people mean by Christian marriage is not so much that
it takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the various
commitments to each other that are associated with marriage in the
Bible  clh

 One thing I don't understand is why being sacred should make the
 temple rituals secret

The so sacred it's secret explanation is a bit misleading  While
there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment there is no
injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public  But
since public discussion is often irreverent most Mormons would rather
keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned

But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants
explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the
ceremony itself

 Granted the Gnostic Christians
 had their secret rituals but these seem to have been taken entirely
 from pagan preChristian mystery religions

There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter
One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was
written by their enemies  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret
information to Peter James and John after His resurrection and that
those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve
Eusebius Historia Ecclesiastica II 

Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and
bishops Against Heresies IV  but Eusebius disagrees  He
claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the
apostles  Interestingly enough Eusebius refers to the groups which
we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis Eusebius
op cit III   His gripe was not that thay professed a
gnosis but that they had the wrong one

Writings dealing with Jesus' postresurrection teachings emphasize
secrecy  not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching
certain things indiscriminately  In one story Simon Magus opens a
dialog with Peter on the nature of God  Peter's response is You seem
to me not to know what a father and a God is But I could tell you
both whence souls are and when and how they were made but it is not
permitted to me now to disclose these things to you Clementine
Recognitions II   If any one theme underlies the Recognitions
it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught but
can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached

Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways  I
don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do but I
believe that evidence exists favorably interpreted of course of
early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today

 Neither New Testament
 Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices

But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies would you expect
to read about them in public documents  One can search the Book of
Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on
temple worship  Yes you could establish that Mormons worship in
temples but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that
worship  On that basis can we conclude that the Bible explains all
practices which might have taken place and that absence of such
descriptions proves they did not exist

Mormon scholar Dr Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from
which I have taken a few

 It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven but to them it is not given Matt 

 All men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given
Matt 

 I have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them
now John 

 The time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs
but I shall shew you plainly of the Father John 

  unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter
 Cor 

 Many things  I would not write with paper and ink but I 
come unto you and speak face to face  Jn 

Nibley Since Cumorah pp 

Again these can also be interpreted many different ways  I believe
they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught
were actually taught openly

 I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire
 practice ie both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual
 from the Freemasons  Anybody in the know have any authoritative
 information on whether or not this claim is true

Historically Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple
endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons
There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not
change after Smith became a Mason  It can be argued that Smith had
ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his
time and through his brother Hyrum a Mason though no specific
connection has yet been established

My conversations with Masons with respect to temple rite
transcriptions which have appeared on the net have led me to believe
that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous  As
our moderator notes most of what was similar was removed in the
recent revisions to the temple ceremony  I believe that critics who
charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have
adequate knowledge of the rites in question

Dan's question about Mormon Temple rituals deleted for brevity
 
Just thought I would interject this and I believe you Dan when you say
that you don't mean to offend  For us LDS temple goers the temple
ceremonies are very sacred  So much so that anyone who goes there
promises never to divulge them  So how much can you trust someone
who is telling you about the cerermony 

One thing I don't understand is why being sacred should make the
temple rituals secret  There are lots of sacred things in
Christianity including the Sacred Scriptures themselves but there is
nothing secret about these things  

Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain 
things before the world ie publish them widely

These things sacred to Himself  He may place any 
pre or postconditions He feels are necessary

Moreover there are precedents in scripture where
knowledge of sacred things is withheld

 After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed
Peter James and John to tell the vision to no 
man until the Son of man be risen again from 
the dead Matt   
If we were living at the time of Savior there
would be no public record of this event

 A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision 
of paradise when he heard unspeakable words 
which it is not lawful for a man to utter
 Cor 
This person heard something which Paul can not 
write to the Corinthians and us

 There is an incident recorded in the Book of
Mormon where words uttered by babes were 
forbidden that there should not any man write
them  Nephi  the entire text follows
for those of you without access to the BOM

 Nephi 
Behold it came to pass on the morrow that the 
multitude gathered themselves together and they
both saw and heard these children yea even 
babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous
things and the things which they did utter were
forbidden that there should not any man write them

Some LDS scholars speculate that these words
which could not be written are the sacred
portions from temple we are to withhold from 
the world but it could be something else

I
can understand why Mormons would limit temple access to only faithful
Mormons but I have never understood the emphasis on shrouding temple
ritual in mystery  

There is much we can discuss about the temple 
ordinances  We can discuss regarding baptisms
and other vicarious ordinances for the dead
We can discuss certain concepts regarding the
endowment the ritual
However there are certain elements I can not
discuss with anyone including other saints
outside of the temple
As a portion of the endowment we receive the
tokens and signs that will permit us access
to Heaven  I must keep this knowledge sacred 
and respect the conditions under which it is
revealed to me

babies are born in such a state that should they die they are cuf off
from God and put in hell which is exactly the doctrine of St Augustine
and St Thomas  Of coures having only original sins on thier souls
they suffer the lightest punishment the loss of the vision oand
presence of God but that does not change the undeniable fact that they
cannot possibly come to a forgivenss of original sin nor can they
inherit eternal life  That as St Augustine said Is what the
Pelagian heretics taught  Which is why he said later If you want to

I am interested in views about the nonevent of May  Seriously how can a 
Christian discriminate between messages from God which are to be taken 
seriously and those which are spurious  Is there a useful heuristic which 
would help us avoid embracing messages which by their nonfulfillment are 
proven to be false thus causing the name of Christ to be placed in 
disrepute Is this a problem at all

I believe that a careful understanding of scripture can help us here It 
seems to me that anytime we are proven by events to be mistaken it points 
to a serious failure in understanding God's will It should result in a 
reevaluation of what we accept as truth

I must hasten to add that I was always skeptical even cynical about 
these prophesies as I tend to be concerning all such But clearly many 
Christians put much stock in them If the Church represents Christ in the 
world then Christians must avoid being made the laughingstock of the 
world lest we dishonor Him Further the more often we cry wolf the 
less seriously we tend to be taken

Any comments


	Good point  it is very true that these false predictions are
dangerouswe are warned more than once in scripture about false prophtets

	However as is often the case with other issues one cannot let those
who falsly report such visions as a reason against believing in any of them
I did not get the impression you were asserting this by the wayI consider
my response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topic
as a whole

	something that happened less than a year later w the Bolshevik
	revolution  She also predicted the second world war that is predicte	predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope who
	was not the current one  It happened just like she said

	She warned there would be fire in the sky as a warning that the 
	second world war was about to start  About a week before Germany
	invaded weathermen and women I suppose all over Europe from

Arrogance is arrogance  It is not the result of religion it is the result
of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one's desire to show
others of one's rightness  I assume that God decided to be judge for our
sake as much as his own if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the 
judge we'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged 
ourselves                                            
 
 Cor  But if we judged ourselves we would not come under judgment 
When we are judged by the   Lord we are being discipled so
that we will not be condemned with the world

 Cor  Even though I am not physically present I am with you in spirit
And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this just as if I were
present           

 Cor  The spiritual man makes judgments about all things but he
himself is not      subject to any man's       judgement  'For
who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him'  But we have the
mind of Christ

Jude  Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied about these men  'See
the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge
everyone and to    convict all the ungodly of       all
the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way and of all the harsh words
ungodly sinners have spoken against him'

Arrogance is a sin  Although a desire to show others of one's rightness may
be a sign of arrogance in some cases  it may be only a sign that they are
following the Bible in others

Jude  Be merciful to those who doubt snatch others from the fire and
save them to others show mercy mixed with   fear  hating   even
 the clothing stained by corrupted flesh


If I find someone arrogant I typically don't have anything to do with them  

I hope you don't find me arrogant then  This sounds like a bad practice 
ignoring what certain people say because you perceive them as arrogant

James  My dear brothers take note of this  Everyone should be quick to
listen slow to speak and slow to become angry

  there is nothing in Christianity that precludes the idea of
  repeated lives on earth

There is a paragraph in the New Testament which in my opinion clearly makes
a positive inference to reincarnation I don't remember which one it is off of
the top of my head but it basically goes like this Jesus is talking with the
apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come
Elijah must first come Jesus replies that Elijah has come but they did not 
recognize him It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to
John the Baptist This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation Can anyone
offer a reasonable alternative interpretation I would be very interested to 
hear it

I have seen the claims but I don't know if there are any
authenticated cases of people making prolonged speeches in
real languages they don't know From my observations speaking
in tongues in practice has nothing at all do with this

I have a simple test I take several people who can speak
only one language eg chinese russian german english
Then I let the gifted one start speaking in toungues
The audience should understand the gifted one clearly
in their native language However the gifted one can
only hear himself speaking in his own language


There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which
are problematic  It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling
to me  I understand that when you pray in tongues the spirit is doing
the talking  And when you pray you pray to God  And the Spirit is
God  So the Spirit is talking to Himself  Which is why I only go
by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language

Moreover the phrase though I speak with the tongues of men and angels
used by Paul in I Cor is misleading out of context   Some would then
assume that there is some angelic tongue and if when they speak it
is no KNOWN language then it is an angelic tongue

Hmmmin the old testament story about the tower of Babel we see how
God PUNISHED by giving us different language  Can we assume then that
if angels have their own language at all that they have the SAME one
amongst other angels  After all THEY were not punished in any manner

So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE
ANOTHER  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to 
justify jabbering

But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned

Trouble is while such stories abound any and all attempts at
verification and we are to test the spirit either show that
the witness had no real idea of the circumstances or that outright
fabrication was involved  The Brother Puka story in a previous post
seems like a friend of a friend thing  And linguistically a two
syllable word hardly qualifies as language inflection or no

Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their victories since
most ailments cured are just plain unprovable and modern day
ressurrections have never been validated so is it true that no
modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay

     I just thought I'd share a nice experience before my exam today
I was walking down the streets on our campus and a beggar came up and asked
me for any spare change I might have  I had a dollar or so that I gave her
and  not wanting to give away all my money to strangers I generally give
a dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something  I offered
her some spiritual gifts as I called them rather than gifts of money
I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day and how
nice it was to give to people  she then said she was getting married soon
She talked about how she and her husband had very little they may not have
even had a house for all I know but that they felt a very special love in
the Lord an unselfish kind of caring  It warmed my heart to know that 
people can have so little monetarily and realize that spiritually they are
indeed very rich  A good lesson for all of us who say we want more more
more what we really need cannot be counted or sold or bought

Michael and Gabriel  In fact his name was Satanel  He did challenge
God's authority and got kicked out of heaven  A lot of the mythology
of Satan he lost the el suffix when he fell comes from the
Book of Enoch and is not found in the bible

Read the Book of Enoch available thru bookstores or get the book

why are atheists atheists believes it could be the result of
brokenness

This is condescending at best and a slightly disquised ad hominem
attack This attitude on the part of many theists especially the
vocal ones is one reason for the hostility you sense How do you
like it when atheists say that people turn to religion out of
immature emotionalism

i agree  if you are going to find out anything from people who don't
share your beliefs do not attack them or condescend to them and hope
to get a neutral picture of them  come to them with an open mind

I don't believe that atheists are generally any more broken
than anybody else Any cause and effect is likely to be the
other way There is an emotional price to pay for being different
hearing one's beliefs or lack thereof condemned and one's
motives and character attacked

well you do believe in something as i see it even if it is a sort
of antibelief no negative connotation meant i mean simply that
you believe that God does not exist  christians can also feel that
sense of difference however when they are associated with those
weird televangelists who always talk about satan  if you'll excuse
the cliched sound of this everyone has to deal with his her
differences from other people  i can understand how being an atheist
could be hard for you being a christian is sometimes hard for me

I became an atheist when I got old enough to reason because there
was just no good reason to believe the religion I had been taught
This was very painful because of the pressure I was placed under by
my family and friends I wanted to fit in believe and be accepted
I tried but finally the cognitive dissonance was just too great

you should not have to repress how you feel  you should be able to
discuss it without fear  i think there are admirable things to learn
from any belief which can enrich your own  by asking myself the
questions that atheists may ask me i can learn the answers and become
stronger in my faith  if my faith can't support knowing the answers
to those questions it is weak and untrue 

I have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and
having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves
because I've been there Only in my case it was my rationality instead
of sexuality which I was forced to try to repress

in some way the pressures were different of course because you
chose your beliefs  or are you saying that they were not your
choice but born of necessity  please no flames about whether or
not gay people choose their lifestyle  that's elsewhere in this
newsgroup

 I must say that I
wasn't hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends
who didn't become atheists I was just hurt differently

i'm not sure i understand this sentence  could you explain

moderator points out that many most atheists aren't hostile they
just cease believiing in xiantiy religion

True Consider also that people like Pat Robertson and many of the
Christian extremists in socreligionchristianity naturally evoke
hostility by their attacks on anyone who disagrees and their attempts
to force their views on others You are known by the company you keep
Christians trying to preach in altatheism should not be surprised by
hostility

ouch yes  part of being a christian is accepting everyone with an
open heart  including people of our own camp with whom we
completely disagree  by the same token i believe that accusation and
suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith
nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our
religion  i have a different idea of mission be what i am a
christian who is happy in her faith and if others see that and want
to know about either the happiness or the religion i'll share what i
know without pressure and let them make their own decisions  at some
point you just have to agree to disagree  acceptance of diversity
not uniformity is the way to sow peace

because he challenged God's authority  The problem is I cannot
find this in the Bible  Is it in the Bible  If not where did it

i did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a
couple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too  as far as
i could tell although that story was never specifically told in the
bible many references are made to it primarily in the new testament
in the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of
satan as a excuse the pun devil's advocate for yahweh  see the
book of job  getting back to the fallen angel story there are no
references to lucifer in the bible except for a mistranslation of
the morning star in the king james version isaiah  which
probably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as the
sun king referred to louis xiv  

all in all i don't know where the story came from it may have been
rolling around for a long time or milton paradise lost may have
invented it  sorry for the sketchiness of the rest of this but i am
in a hurry and need to eat lunch  feel free to email me about the
other stuff i found out  although a lot of it is just the result
of a bible concordance program called quickverse  it's really

If you are using the standard formula of fully God and fully human
that I'm not sure why you object to saying that Jesus was human  I
think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic
definition of humanity  It's a consequence of the fall  Jesus is
human but not a fallen human  clh
 
I differ with our moderator on this  I thought the whole idea of God coming
down to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death as one of
the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer  puts it was
that Jesus was tempted but did not succumb  If sin is not part of the
basic definition of humanity then Jesus fully human Nicea would not
be subject to sin but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning
because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin  To distinguish
between human and fallen human makes Jesus less like one of us at the
time we need him most

 These issues get mighty subtle  When you see people saying different
 things it's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously
 different things or whether they are using different terminology  I
 don't think there's any question that there is a problem with
 Nestorius and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form
 without a real human nature or will is heretical  But I'd like to be
 a bit wary about the Copts Armenians etc  Recent discussions
 suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from
 orthodoxy as many had thought  Nestorius was an extreme
 representative of one of the two major schools of thought  More
 moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox eg Theodore of
 Mopsuestia  My impression is that the modern monophysite groups
 inherit the entire tradition not just Nestorius' version and that
 some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as
 orthodox  clh

First the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version  they 
were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him  Second the historical
record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as
extreme as his successful opponents who wrote the conventional history
claimed  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary arguing
I think correctly that a human could not be called Mother of God  I mean
in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son uncreate  surely even 
Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary  Anyway Nestorius's
opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos that he claimed
that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus which would require
two seperate and distinct natures  The argument fails though because
Mary simply gave birth to Jesus who preexisted her either divinely
if you accept Nestorianism as commonly defined or both natures intertwined
a la Chalcedon

Second I am not sure that Nestorianism is not a better alternative than
the orthodox view  After all I find it hard to believe that preIncarnation
that Jesus's human nature was in heaven likewise postAscension  I think
rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him  It was a seperate
nature capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane since I believe the divine
nature could never be tempted but in its moments of weakness the divine nature
prevailed

Comments on the above warmly appreciated

Jason Albert

There may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin  The
original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call
Jesus fully human because he didn't sin  I completely agree that
Jesus was subject to temptation  I simply object to the idea that by
not succumbing he is thereby not fully human  I believe that you do
not have to sin in order to be human

I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism  I
agree with you and have said elsewhere that there's reason to think
that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in
fact heretical  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was
not Nestorian  I have to confess that the first time I read some of
the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents I thought he
got the better of them

However most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to
Chalcedon was an advance and that Nestorius was at the very least
rash and dogmatic as the editor of The Christological Controversy
refers to him in rejecting all approaches other than his own  As
regular Usenet readers know narrowness can be just as much an
impediment as being wrong  Furthermore he did say some things that I
think are problematical  He responds to a rather mild letter from
Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet  In it he says To attribute also
to the Logos in the name of the incarnation the characteristics
of the flesh that has been conjoined with him  is my brother
either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the
Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and
Apollinaris and the others  Those who are thus carried away with the
idea of this association are bound because of it to make the divine
Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some
degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his
fearfulness   These things are taken falsely when they are put off
on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us
who perpetrate the falsehood

It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between
humanity and divinity  But the whole concept of incarnation is based
on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have to some
degree a part in being born growing up and dying  Of course it
must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'
participation in these things  But there must be some sort of
identification between the divine and human or we don't have an
incarnation at all  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white
terms and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this
area

You say I find it hard to believe that preIncarnation that Jesus's
human nature was in heaven  I don't think that's required by
orthodox doctrine  It's the divine Logos that is eternal

Somewhere someone told me that Satan was the angel in charge of
music in heaven and on top of that he was the most beautiful
of the angels  Isn't it funny that these days how MTV has become
the bible of music and beauty these days  MTV controls what bands
are popular no matter how bad they are  In fact it is better to
be politically correct  like U Madonna  than to have any
musical talent  Then of course you have this television station
that tells us all how to dress  Think about it who started the
retrofashion craze  MTV and Madonna  Gag

Anyway just food for thought  It is really my own wierd theory

If Revelation was to come true today I think MTV would the ever
changing waters music and fashion world that the beast would
arise from and Madonna will be the whore of Babylon riding the

There is dis
crepancy even among charismatic organizations as to the proper use
of tongues  Be it revelatory with interpretation for prayer use
or for signifying believers which I doubt since any one can do it
Pentecostals Assembly of God Church of Christ seem to espouse all
three  Neopentecostals tend to view prayer use and as a sign as the
uses  Speaking in tongues during a service is not usually done by
neopentecostals because for the most part they still attend Protestant
churches  Nondenominational churches seem to view the use as a sign
as merely optional but recommended

Koberg

	Just a couple of minor corrections here

	  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in
tongues in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to
Pentecostal teaching  You are probably thinking of Church of God in
Christ the largest AfricanAmerican Pentecostal denomination

	  I'm not sure what you mean by signifying believers  but it
should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now nor has it
ever held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian 
The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals including the AG maintain is
that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming
a Christian in which one is Baptized in the Holy Spirit  That may be
what you were referring to but I point this out because Pentecostals are
frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order
to be a Christian  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the
majority of Pentecostals   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in
Mark  about these signs following them that believe but they generally
do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't
saved

	  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that
has such diversity but I think you've made some pretty big
generalizations here  Do NeoPentecostals only believe in tongues as a
sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message 
I've never heard of that before  In fact I would have characterized them
as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as
a sign of Spirit Baptism  Also while neoPentecostals may not be
inclined to speak in tongues in the nonPentecostal churches they attend
they do have their own meetings and in many cases a whole church will be
charismatic

It seems that during the Middle Ages it was customary for pastors to 
explain the Trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water
Water is water but can exist in three formsliquid ice and vapor
Thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms

And recently the pastor of my church drew an analogy which I
also found usefulA woman is often percieved by others in three
ways depending on their relationship to hera mother a wife and
an employee in a business

Thus it seems clear to me that the essence of God can subsist in
the Father Son and Holy Spirit or depending on one's particular
need for Him

I was waiting for this I think your question should be rephrased The many
verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality by our beliefs have been
shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by wellmeaning
Christians The question is how do they interpret these verses Any discussion
of any issue this or any other issue requires a proof of your case as well
as a disproof of the opposing view We are already familiar with those verses
and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour We
must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the
interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with
them

Concerning Christians praying for coporate forgiveness of national sins 
Michael Covington claims the following of CS Lewis

 C S Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II
 when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging national repentance
 for the horrors sins of World War II

I was surprised when I heard this same kind of remark from a fellow grad 
student I know especially since he had seminary training  I have read the 
same essay and do not find Lewis making any such claim  Rather Lewis is 
condemning the use of such coporate prayer efforts as platforms to make 
political jabs at opponents feigned as confessions of guilt ie Lord please 
forgive us for allowing insert political issueideaplatform to exist in our
country it is wrong and we ask your forgiveness  I would be interested in
knowing what part of the essay you feel condemns national repentance please

A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on
earth

One piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact
that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was
buried Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final
resting places of Peter Mark and other saints but no one ever
claimed to possess the body of Mary the greatest of the saints Why
Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven

Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of
Mary some passages seem suggestive like the passage in Revelation
that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned
in the heavens Of course the woman in this passage has other
interpretations she can also be taken a symbol for the Church

The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to
Christ  Jesus perfect God and perfect man fulfilled the
requirements of the law perfectly  Under the law God gave to us we
are to honor our mother and father and Christ's act of taking his
mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law Also he
took his flesh from her so it seems appropriate that he decide not to
allow her flesh to rot in the grave

One last point an exCatholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine
on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary
did not die This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe
The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying
whether Mary did or did not die In fact the consensus among Catholic
theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die This would make
sense Christ died and his Mother who waited at the foot of the
cross would want to share in his death

I posted this a couple of weeks ago and it doesn't seem to have appeared  
on the newsgroup and I haven't had a reply from the moderator We were  
having intermittent problems with our mail at the time Please excuse me  
if you have seen this before

Should Christians fight

Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting and whether there  
are such things as justifiable wars I have started looking into these  
things and have jotted down my findings as I go I haven't answered all  
his questions yet and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  
tack but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later and post  
some more info soon

Our duty to our neighbour

Do good to all men Gal 
Love our neighbour as ourselves Matt 

Act the part of the good Samaritan Luke  toward any who may be in  
trouble We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  
man and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  
people harm even medical corps of the army etc

Christians are by faith citizens of the commonwealth of Israel  
Ephesians  and also recognise that God rules in the kingdoms of  
men and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  
of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith

We are to be strangers and pilgrims amongst the nations so we are just  
passing through and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  
this can also be applied to politics etc but that's another story We  
are not supposed to strive or resist evil even suffer yourselves to  
be defrauded it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  
preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  
God's kingdom

Our duty to the state

Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God  
the things which be God's Luke 
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers For there is no power  
but of God the powers that be are ordained of God Whosoever resisteth  
the power resisteth the ordinance of God Rom 
Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether  
it be to king as supreme for so is the will of God that with well doing  
ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men  Pet 

These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  
divine command but it is equally clear from Acts  that when any  
ordinance of man runs counter to God's law we must refuse submission to  
it The reason for this is that we are God's bond servants and His  
service is our life's task An example of the type of thing is in Col  
 where bondservants were to work heartily as unto the Lord  so  
also we should work as if our boss was God  ie Pressed down shaken  
together and running over oops  a bit of a side track there

In the contests between the nations we are on God's side  a side that is  
not fighting in the battle but is testifying to the truth

When we believe in God and embrace His promises we become fellow  
citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God and are no longer  
interested in associations of the world Think of this in relation to  
unions etc as well Paul tells us to lay aside every weight that we may  
run the race that is set before us and if we are wise we will discard  
any association which would retard our progress  Thou therefore endure  
hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ No man that warreth entangleth  
himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath  
chosen him to be a soldier  Tim 

One of these entanglements he warns about is be ye not unequally yoked  
together with unbelievers One of the obvious applications of this is  
marriage with unbelievers but it also covers things like business  
partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  
with any person or persons not believing the truth about God in this case  
the army The principle comes from Deut   remember that as well as  
them being different animals of different strengths one was clean and one  
unclean under the law These ideas are strongly stressed in  Cor   
 I suggest you read this The yoking also has another aspect  that of  
servitude and Jesus says take my yoke upon you so we are then yoked  
with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers We have already seen  
that we are bondservants of Christ and Paul says become not ye the  
bondservants of men  Cor  RV

An example from the Old Testament the question is asked in  Chr   
Shouldest thou help the ungodly The situation here is a good  
example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers  
Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life Here are the facts
 He had made an affinity with Ahab who had sold himself to work  
wickedness before the Lord  Kings 
 When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance he had agreed and said  
I am as thou art my people as thy people  Kings   an unequal  
yoking
 He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  
on hearing the prophet of the Lord trying to do the right thing he  
found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil  
association he had made

God says to us Come out from among them and be ye separate and touch not  
the unclean thing and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  
daughters  Cor 

This is more or less what I have found out so far  I'm still looking into  
it as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair  
yet Heres a summary and a few things to think about

The Christian in under command Obedience to this command is an essential  
factor in his relationship with Christ John 

Total dedication to this course of action is required Romans 

Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  
followers  Pet 

We are to be separated to God Rom  This involves a masterservant  
relationship Rom 

No man can serve two masters Matt 

All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride  quite opposed to Gos   
John  Christs kingdom is not of this world ie not worldly in  
nature  if it was his servants would fight to deliver him If Christ is  
our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  
was not of this world then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  
master

Strangers and pilgrims have no rights and we cannot swear allegiance to  
anyone but God

The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all  Tim    
this does not just apply to war but also to avoiding strife throughout  
our lives There is a war to be waged not with man's weapons  Cor  
 but with God's armour Eph

I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit  
further

Heres the life of St MAria Goretti posted with kind permission of
the editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine Morning Star

Hope you like it

    Put up with anything to prevent sin St Maria Goretti



    Maria was born on October th  to Luigi and Assunta Goretti
    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven She was a cheerful
    girl always imitating her parents  She had but one disire  but
    one wish to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament

    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on
    the feast of Corpus Christi For Maria time seemed like an eter
    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day   When  it  finally
    arrived Fr Jerome the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and
    give the children their First Holy Communion delivered a  sermon
    on	the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love
    we should have in return for Him He then warmly  urged  them  to
    die rather than commit a mortal sin

    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy
    Eucharist	Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's
    absence who died some time beforehand As for the	rest  of  the
    day  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit that is
    until

				   







    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion
    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life

    Over the next twelve months Maria had changed  from  a  giggling
    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities As her
    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband	Maria
    took  on the ironing cooking washing and other motherly duties
    She was doing this not only for her own family but also for  the
    Serenellis a father and son who lived with the Goretti's owning
    a share in the farm Although Maria was poorer than all the other
    children she by far surpassed them in virtue In all thi ngs she
    did the Holy Will of God

    During the month of June  Alessandro  Serenellithe  son	twice
    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her On
    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's
    strong  grip but on the second he threatened to kill her if she
    even uttered a word to her mother From this day on Maria	lived
    in terror fearing lest Alessandro attack again


    On July th  Alessandro left work in the fields  to  get  a
    handkerchief  as	he  claimed He went to the storeroom beneath
    the house where Maria who was outside on the  landing  with  the
    baby  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools She wondered
    what he was doing It was later learned that he was sharpening  a
      blade He went to the house and called for Maria She told
    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed He
    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room Mar ia
    instantly realized what he was up to No No No Do  not	touch
    me  It  is a sin you will go to Hell At this point Alessandro
    held the knife over Maria's chest who was now on the floor

    Will you or will you not Maria gathered all her energy	No I
    will  not	Alessandro  no   She had chosen her martyrdom over
    sin God over Satan  Overcome with rage Alessandro plunged  the
    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times  Finally he came to
    his senses and thought Maria was dead  Frantically he threw  the
    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room  The crying
    of the baby Teresa	on  the  landing  brought  the	attention  to
    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro As the baby was unattended
    and was in danger of falling off they ran to the house  to  find
    Maria  who  covered in blood was dragging herself to the door
    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her   He
    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not

    The ambulance arrived then the police who took Alessandro	away
    As	the  ambulance	carried  Maria to the hospital a large crowd
    followed on foot  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for
    poor  little Maria  The same Fr Jerome who gave Maria her First
    Communion

				   







    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum
    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer  Yes  For the
    love of Jesus I forgive him  I wish for him to one day  join  me
    in	Paradise   May  God forgive him for I alread y have Maria
    died at about three o'clock

    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but
    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in
    prison  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show
    ing  no regret for his crime he saw in a dream in the  midst of
    a field of flowers Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to
    him  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop begging God's par
    don for the grave sin he had committed  He later gave  testimony
    in	Maria's  beatification in   Less than three years later
    on Ju ne th  Maria was canonised  Assunta Goretti was the
    first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation

    May St Maria Goretti help	us  to	be  pure  and  grant  us  the
    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin

    Saint Maria Goretti pray for us

    Could anyone enlighten me on how the Mormon church views 
children born out of wedlock  In particular I'm interested to know if any 
stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents  I'm especially 
keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on 
bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical 
book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City  If this is an issue on which the 
official position has changed over time I'm interested in learning both old 
and new beliefs  Email or posting is fine  All information or pointers are

mcovingtaisunaiugaedu Michael Covington writes

I heard on the radio today about a Christian student conference where
Christians were called to repent of America's national sins such
as sexual promiscuity

How can I repent of someone else's sin   I can't

And when I claim to repent of someone else's sin am I not in fact
judging him  Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us
not to judge people Judge not that ye be not judged

Strictly speaking you're right  we can't repent for somebody else
for what they've done  I guess I don't think it's out of line to talk
about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation
in The sins of society  or for our tacit approval by our silence of
sinful attitudes or practicesit may be that we're also just plain
begging for mercy hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on
our whole country for the sake of a few much as Abraham sought to do
for the sake of Lot  Hmmm the results there were pretty cautionary

A few times lately when I've observed some either outandout sinful 
activity or just some selfdestructive activity I've gotten a strong
impression that many folks really don't know any better  Christ's pity
on the crowds as being like sheep without a shepherd rings true to me
If these folks don't have a clue do I bear any responsibility for my
not having communicated a better way  Worse still have I expressed 
judgement and disgust at their doings and thus alienated them from any 
positive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive  
I know I've got something to repent about on that score

Anyway it's a real interesting question

In all candor I would be happy to be proven wrong about believing

In mentioning some nonsense about psychology  and atheism Bob Muir asks
the following question   

	Do I sound broken to you

I answer in the affirmative  Now this answer might sound a little
intellectually dishonest to Bob but I think I have been accused before
of that heinous crime and am man enough to take it    What thinking
person has not at one time or other been accused of it   Is it
politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group
permitted the luxury of arrogance   

Now I have a question for Bob  Why in the world would any selfrespecting
atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group  I have a 
difficult enough time keeping up with it and I think I know something
about the subject     

Bob reminds me of my roommate  In order to disbelieve atheism he says 
he will need to be proven wrong about it  Well I don't even waste 
my time trying  I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it 
In response he tells me he will say an atheist's prayer for me 

Good luck Bob  And best regards

Hello all
     I have a question about Satan  I was taught a long time ago
that Satan was really an angel of God and was kicked out of heaven
because he challenged God's authority  The problem is I cannot
find this in the Bible  Is it in the Bible  If not where did it
originate

Wondering
Eddie

	The quick answer  Revelation 

	And there was war in heaven  Michael and his angels fought against
	the dragon and his angels who fought back  But he the dragon was
	not strong enough and they lost their place in heaven  The great
	dragon was hurled downthat ancient serpent called the devil and
	Satan who leads the whole world astray  He was hurled down to the
	earth and his angels with him

	The earlier part of chapter  deals very symbolically with why
	Satan rose up in battle against Michael and the good angels in the
	first place

	Hope this clears it up

	Just a quick reminder  

	The way you are interpreting those passages is your opinion  You make
	it sound as if your opinion is somehow an undisputable fact

	Many would interpret the passages you cite very differently

	Many haveseveral of the great theologians you mentioned do that 
	very thing  These were people who had much more expertise in the
	interpretation of scripture than you or me or probably anyone reading
	this newsgroup  To say that all of them are wrong and you are right
	is in my opinion notice those last three words coming pretty darn
	close to the sin of pride  

	In the future I would suggest you not be so absolutist in your 
	interpretations especially when contradicting highly respected
	doctors of Christianity

Homosexual Christians have indeed checked out these verses  Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations
Others simply do not address the issues

You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spiritled course
in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know  I suggest that

I deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the 
specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce  

In article Mayathosrutgersedu crscarsonuwashingtonedu Cliff Slaughterbeck writes

Along the way she was married happily to a wonderful and
supportive husband and gave birth to two sons  Still everything was not
perfect for Jane since she could never open up the deepest part of her
soul to her husband  She always found that she could be much closer to
her women friends than to her husband as good and loing as a husband as
he might be  She struggled very much with this until at the age of  she
decided that she was a lesbian  When she came home to announce this 
understanding of herself her husband told her that he had come to the same
understanding several years before and was waiting for her to come to that
realization in her own time  Her children ages  and  at the time were
also extremely supportive of her  As the youngest put it that just 
means that you love people very much  Jane and her husband agreed to
divorce but remain friends and still consider each other as part of the
extended family to this day

One of the interesting things that Jane said in this whole discussion was
Homosexuality is not about what goes on in the bedroom  She found that
she was much more able to have a deep committed relationship with a woman
than a man  Sex in her mind is only a part of the whole relationship
The key thing is how one interconnects with other people  She made a
specific point to say that it was not that she had never met a good man
since she was married to a wonderful man for a dozen years  Take a few
seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it's implications

I have thought about the implications and it is scary  

We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have 
decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the
thrill of a younger more attractive woman  If we accept that it is
legitimate for Jane to have divorced how can we not accept anyone's
decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can
have a more deep committed relationship

Marriage is not a state of being it is a mutual journey in life
Love is not a passive feeling it must be actively willed

Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many 
years who stayed home to care for the children because he
can't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful
young blonde  The real solution for both in the couple to
make a renewed effort  

Hold fast to the faith  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His
relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband  We
learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and
remain faithful through times of trial

My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed
If it were to resume growing it is in remission thanks be to God
then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual
relations  That's lifethe Lord would certainly not give me
permission to seek someone else to satisfy my needs  

The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple grows apart
seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning
of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint
of compromise  We have become so petty and smallminded that
some husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the
wives lose weight

I praise the Lord for guiding me to marry my wife  She married me
anyway despite the possibility that I could have a terrible illness
And it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor but
had I known I wouldn't have cared either  And maybe I'll be in
a car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down
A married couple should deal with these situations with the help
of the Lord not divorce and run away from them

I was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple
ceremony within the last fifty years
Also why do you think they were made revelation 
assimilation to mainstream Christianity etc
I know that the God Makers was published quite a while
ago  Could rituals have been changed since then

I am also very interested in the influence of Freemasonry
on early Mormonism especially in the Smith family and 
in the Nauvoo settlement  Info on any new studies would 
be appreciated

Thanks

Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral other
than Leviticus So far when I ask around here I get the verses from
Leviticus spouted at me but the whole rest of that book tends to be
ignored by Christians haven't seen any stonings in a long time 

Later
Max Bob Muir

The list was posted not long ago as I recall aside from Lev commonly
cited passages are

the story of Sodom  Note however that this was a homosexual rape and
there's no disagreement that that is wrong  I take an intermediate
position on this note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the
Bible for its sinfulness  It doesn't seem to have been known
specifically for homosexuality  Rather I think it was considered a
cesspool of all sins However from what we know of Jewish attitudes
homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action
described  It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about
as many forms of evil in one act as possible homosexual rape of
guests who were actually angels  But this story is not specifically
about homosexuality

In the NT the clear references are all from Paul's letters  In Rom
 there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil
Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality  it's about
idolatry  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment or at
least result of idolatry  There are a number of arguments over this
passage  It does not use the word homosexuality and it is referring
to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality
So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality
But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway
that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards 
homosexuality

The other passages occur in lists of sins in I Cor  and I Tim
  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here
mean  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning
such as wanton and that another may be specifically male
prostitute  Again we don't have here a precise teaching about
homosexuality but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul
shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality

Jude  is sometimes cited however it's probably not relevant  The
context in Jude involves angels  Since those who were almost raped in
Sodom were angels it seems likely that strange flesh refers to
intercourse with angels

As you can see the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is
determined by their approach to the Bible  Conservatives note that
the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT
prohibition  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT
endorsement  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching and no
clear definition of what is being prohibited or why is the concern in
Rom  the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship  what exactly
do the words in the lists of sins mean  Thus some believe it is
legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his
background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel

This is an explosive topic which tends to result in long
dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words  But it's
clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant  What it really comes down
to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they
believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel  This
appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a
whole as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today
This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference
between Protestant and Catholic in the th Cent and one where both
sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they
keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the
other side will finally come to their senses  That makes things
very frustrating for a moderator who realizes that such an optimistic
outcome is not very likely

A listmember D Andrew Killie I think wrote in response to the
suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of God

  Any God who works that way is indescribably evil
  and unworthy of my worship or faith

Nobuya Higgy Higashiyama replied as in substance did others

  Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's
  behavior

It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's
actions  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter But we find a
contrary view in Scripture When God proposes to destroy the city of
Sodom Genesis  Abraham says

  Suppose that there are some good men in the city
  Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked
  Far be it from you Lord to do such a thing
  Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right

I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this and
can perhaps be better rendered dynamic equivalence as

  Shame on you Lord if you do such a thing

There are those who say that the definition of good is whatever
God happens to want But if that is so then the statement that God
is good has no meaning  It simply says that God does what He wants
That being the case no one can either love or obey God because He
is good The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is
powerful Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator even when he
tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them because if you
defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself so it makes
sense to obey God because He has the power to punish you if you
don't This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to
Genesis  and to Christianity in general

Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any
further discussion of morality or of the goodness of God
meaningless However it does not follow that our moral judgements
are always infallible in particular cases still less our judgements
in particular cases about the course of action most likely to
achieve a good result

When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in
history those actions often seem to me very different from what I
might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us
Moreover leaving the Scriptures aside and considering the natural
world I find that Nature is often very different from what I might
expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity  Origen said
Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of
the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort
of difficulties that they find in Nature

Now that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an
argument against the existence power wisdom and goodness of God
On the contrary their ABSENCE would be such an argument Suppose
that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess and suppose that every
time he makes a move I find myself nodding and saying Good move
Just what I was expecting him to do  Same move I would have made if
I were playing That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a
chess player than myself Given that he is better I expect that at
least some of his moves will have me thinking Now what do suppose
induced him to do that or even Boy that was a real slip  he's
just thrown the game away Similarly if God understands the
workings of the universe better than I do it is to be expected that
sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake

One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the
controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess
game If Fisher wins I revise my earlier inference that it was
carelessness that made him lose his queen  moves earlier
However if he loses and particularly if I can see that there was a
time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did
not take it then I know that he is not as good a player as I had
thought

With God on the other hand I shall not in this life see the total
result of some of His actions Therefore my grounds for judging
that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier
than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher

                         

In the book of Genesis we read that Joseph's ten older brothers
who with good reason found  him insufferable conspired to sell
him into slavery in Egypt There he eventually became Viceroy and
when there was a famine in Canaan he was able to provide for his
family When his brothers nervously apologized he told them Do
not worry You meant to do me evil but God turned it into good

I once heard a rabbi speak on this text He said

        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events
   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued
   survival of the religion or the people or both But
   amazingly those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews
   and of Judaism
        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup
   of the family  But in fact it ended with a reconciliation of
   the quarrel between them The famine that drove the family out
   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them  But in fact if
   they had stayed in Canaan they would almost certainly have
   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into
   their culture  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few
   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a
   disaster But God used it to bring them out of Egypt and into
   the Promised Land
        Here the people built a Temple and regularly offered
   sacrifices But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea
   destroyed Temple and city and countryside and deported most of
   the people to Babylon You might have thought that that would
   be the end of the people and the religion But it was not
   Living in Canaan the people had been under constant danger of
   assimilation  Again and again they had turned from the
   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility
   cults with their ritual prostitution and ritual human
   sacrifice The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that Never
   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry
   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the
   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them
        Nor is that all Judaism had been in danger of becoming
   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances The only
   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem
   every so often and offering a sacrifice During the Captivity
   with the Temple gone the Jews invented the synagogue a place
   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the
   Scriptures They came to realize clearly what they were in
   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea
   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity not just the
   controller of the land of Canaan or the patron of the Jewish
   people but the Creator of the world and the Ruler and Judge
   of all humans everywhere
        Time passed and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by
   that of the Persians and then that of the Greeks or rather
   the Macedonians The ruler Antiochus Epiphanes was determined
   to stamp out Judaism and to this end he made the reading and
   the study of the Torah punishable by death Again one might
   think that this would be the end of Judaism But it was not
   The people met for worship and instead of reading the Torah
   portion appointed for the day they would read some passage
   from the prophets that had a similar theme and then discuss
   that  Before this time the Torah the socalled Five Books of
   Moses Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy
   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue  If it
   had not been for Antiochus the books of the prophets would
   probably have been forgotten altogether His hatred for Judaism
   saved them

        Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake

        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became
   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR
   LADY When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it
   everyone expected that Julie who had been so magnificent on
   stage would play the same role in the movie Instead the
   studio decided to go with an established screen star and cast
   Audrey Hepburn  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed But she
   later realized that if she had played the screen role she
   would have been typecast for life as an Elize Doolittle type
   It would have been a disaster for her As it was Walt Disney
   offered her the role of Mary Poppins and she won an Oscar for
   it  At the presentation she stood there smiling and looking
   at Walt Disney she said And now my special thanks to the
   man who made all this possible  JACK WARNER It was the most
   memorable line of the evening
        In a similar spirit we Jews might thank the men who in
   the providence of God have preserved Judaism and kept it alive
   to this day beginning with Joseph's brothers and continuing
   with two Pharaohs with Nebuchadnezzar with Antiochus
   Epiphanes

After the formal meeting had broken up one woman came up to him
privately and said You were talking about the Holocaust weren't
you He answered If that is an example that came to your mind
then you are right I was talking about it to you But I would not
talk about it to everyone for not everyone can bear it I assume
that he meant that without the Holocaust there would have been no
state of Israel

Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion
that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His
purposes  or at least that the rabbi thought so He might then  go
on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing  that He
stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him and
that when the Israelites were in Egypt God hardened Pharaoh's
heart so that he oppressed the people and would not let them go
And this raises questions about how an action can be considered
wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has
brought about

I suggest another way of looking at it Consider a sculptor who has
a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue But the log
instead of having a smooth even grain throughout has a large knot
that spoils the appearance of the surface The sculptor considers
the wood for a while and then carves a statue that features the
knot that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color
of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue so that
observers will say How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a
piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place Its
presence is the crowning touch the thing that makes the statue a
great work of art In reality the knot far from being what the sculptor was
looking for was a challenge to his skill If the wood had not
contained that flaw he would still have made a great work of art
but a different one So if Joseph's brothers had not sold him God
would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people
but He would have done so in another manner If Judas had not
betrayed Jesus if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected
Jesus but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God if
Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set
Jesus free it might appear that there would have been no
Crucifixion and therefore no Redemption and therefore no
Salvation Not so God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us If
Judas had done right then God in Christ would still have reconciled
the world to Himself  We do not know how just as we do not know
how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its
interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station and
just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth
game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops
and had attacked Fisher's knight instead don't bother to look up
the game in questionI am making up this example but the point is
none the less valid

Thus we may say both  that God used say the cowardice of
Pilate to accomplish His purposes and  that the said cowardice
was not God's doing and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's
plans by behaving justly and courageously

What then are we to make of the place where God says to Moses I
will harden Pharaoh's heart so that he will not let the people go
Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet
with God pulling the strings and that his stubbornness and cruelty
were not his own work but the work of God in him I suppose rather
that what God was telling Moses was something like this If you see
that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go do not be
discouraged or suppose that the situation is out of my control My
purposes will not be thwarted If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and
let the people go well and good If he does not I will fit his
resistance into my plans and fit it so perfectly that future
historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been
thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me

To return to the question that started this all off Is it possible
that the Serbs in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia are
instruments of God's will
     First point What they are doing is wrong just as what
Joseph's brothers did was wrong just as what Judas did was wrong
They intend it for evil If God somehow brings good out of it that
does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and
punishment
     Second point Of course God will bring good out of it But not
the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had
refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder Nor does the
good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right

 Yours

Hi Damon  No matter what system or explanation of creation you wish
to accept you always have to start with one of two premises creation
from nothing or creation from something  There are no other
alternatives  And if we accept one or the other of those two
premises then again there are two alternatives either creation was
random or was according to some plan
   If it was random I am unable to accept that the complex nature of
our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures
could exist as they do  Therefore I am left with creation under the
control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme  I call
that intelligence God
   I also prefer the Creatio ex nihilo rather than from chaos as it
is cleaner
   There is obviously no way to prove either or neither  We are and
we must have come from somewhere  Choose whatever explanation you
feel most comfortable with Damon  You are the one who has to live
with your choice

The Apostle Paul Romans  points out that God chose Jacob

WoahThe context is about God's calling out a special people the Jews to

 Let my state my point as provocatively as possible 
 
 After going through several study Bibles I'm leaning heavily towards the 
 assertion that Sirach 'The Wisdom of Ben Sira' or 'Ecclesiasticus'
 is directly referenced by James  in fact I think 
 Sirach is more directly referenced by James than Job or Ruth is 
 referenced in any NT verse I've seen

Good point  The New Testament does not quote Ezra Nehemiah Esther
Ruth Job Ecclesiastes or Song of Songs just as it does not quote
from the Deuterocanon  But if the nonquotation of the former does not
disqualify them neither does the nonquotation of the later  And the
Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St Paul especially
in the letter to the Romans cf especially Romans  and Wisdom

I think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be 
consistently applied are not very useful as principles 
So if we are to exclude them not accord them the authority of
 Scripture we would appear to require other reasons What might these 
 reasons be Tradition always a fav with Episcop  Tradition is equivocal
 on this subject Sirach I believe is in Vaticanus  Sinaiticus
 I don't know if it is listed in the Muratorian canon 
 the oldest list I know of  Sirach and the others are discussed 
 by the Fathers as Scripture but not unanimously
 
True  Not all accepted them as Scripture though niether were all the
books of the New Testament so accepted which puts to the lie the whole
argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not
universally accepted  Hebrews the Apocalypse  Peter Esther and
others were debated at various times but eventually retained  As for
the Codexes you mention both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the
Deuterocanon bothe of the New and Old Testaments and Vaticanus I
think inlcudes  Clement the Shepard of Hermas and the Epistle of
Baranabas  As for the Muratorian Canon it deals with the New Testament
only though it is very valuable in its witness to those books

 My interim conclusion is that Protestant exclusion of 
 at least one of these writings is one of those 'traditions
 of men' one hears of so often They were excluded during the
 Reformation and that appears to be the reason many people
 continue to exclude them

Any takers  I can be reasonable If all else fails 
Show me where I'm wrong

	You're not wrong  It is a tradition of men' to exlcude them as I
will explain below

That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture
except the canonical Scriptures and the canoncial Scriptures are 
Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Joshua Judges Ruth
Four books of Kingdoms being  Samuel and  Kings Two books of
Paralpomenon being  Chronicles Job the Psalter of David the Five
books of Solomon being Proverbs Ecclesiastes Song of Songs Wisdom of
Solomon and misatributed to him the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach
The books of the Twelve Minor Prophets Isaiah Jeremiah being
Jeremiah the Lamentations Baruch and the Letter all of which were
formerly counted as one Ezekiel Daniel Tobit Judith Esther Two
books of Ezra being Ezra and Nehemiah Two books of Maccabees  And of
the New Testament Four books of the Gospel One book of the Acts of the
Apostles Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle One Letter of the same
to the Hebrews two of Peter the Apostle Three of John One of the
Apostle Jude One of the Apostle James One book of the Apocalypse of
John
	Council of Hippo Statute   AD

	This same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage
 AD and at the Sixth Council of Carthage  AD  at which
council the same list was enumerated with the words Because we have
recieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the
Church  Which ought to quiet those who assert in the name of Holy
Scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was
never any doubt in the Church as the Episcopal Church does in removing
the Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture  Though the Episcopalians
hold them in high regard and read them in the Church they are not
counted as Scripture by them and may not be used to prove dogma  The
Lutherans hold out similarly
	Earlier mention of the socalled Apocrypha as divine scripture can also
be found and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it
divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers

And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as
consisting of twentytwo books so that they may correspond to the
number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet It is to be noted also
that by adding to these Tobias and Judith there are twentyfour books
corresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks
	St Hillary of Poitiers Commentaries on the Psalms prologue   AD

The twentytwo books according to the Hebrews are  Jeremiah with
Lamentations and the Letter reckoned as one  and also there is
Maccabees
	Origen Commentaries on the Psalms Psalm   AD

Divine Scripture addressing itself to those who love themselves and to
the boastful  says most excellently Baruch  follows
	St Clement of Alexandria The Instuctor of Children      AD

I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament  Proverbs of
Solomon and also Wisdom 
	St Melito of Sardes fragment found in Eusebius' History of the
Church and dating from crica  AD Book   

It is likewise decreed Now indeed we must treat of the divine
Scriptures what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she must
shun  The list of the Old Testament  Wisdom one book
Ecclesiasticus one book  Tobit one book  Judith one book of
Maccabees two books
	St Damasus I Pope The Decree of Damsus section   AD

	I would think this enough though more can be shown that the Church
has always accepted the deuterocanon though parts have been disputed
by various persons  For if disputes involving the New Testament
deuterocanon does not disqulaify those books ie Hebrews James 
Peter  John Jude Revelation in Protestant eyes than neither
should it disqulaify the Old Testament books  And I must point out that
the Jews only drew up their canon in  AD  years after the founding
of the Christian Religion upon the Cross  Why should we adhere to a
canon that was drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the Chrsitian
use of the Greek Septuagint which includes the deuterocanon  As early
as  AD St Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the
Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain books  Protestants
apparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited by a decree
of the Jews in the ordering of their the Jews' faithless canon and
that he could not use other people like the Apostles in drawing up the
canon  The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint as some
 of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint and
not the Hebrew  And the Septuagint includes the Deuterocanon

The deuterocanonical books were added much later in the church's
history  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of Scripture  I do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the Spirit in so doing  And that is where
this sort of discussion ultimately ends

	Whoah  whoah  whoah  WHOAH   What

	That last paragraph just about killed me  The Deuterocanonicals have
	ALWAYS been accepted as inspired scripture by the Catholic Church
	which has existed much longer than any Protestant Church out there
	It was Martin Luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to
	REMOVE certain booksnot the fact that the Catholic Church decided
	to add some much laterthat is the reason for the difference between
	Catholic and Protestant bibles  

	Sorry for the tonebut that comment really irked me

Should Christians fight

Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting and whether there  
are such things as justifiable wars I have started looking into these  
things and have jotted down my findings as I go I haven't answered all  
his questions yet and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  
tack but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later and post  
some more info soon

May I suggest the book Ethics by Dr Norm Geisler of Dallas Theological

and comes up with a very reasonable answer  If I have time and there is
enough interest I may post his position

PeirYuan Yeh asks

I wonder if the OT is not exactly like Jewish history  Are they the
same or part of them are the same  How about Torah Are the first five
books of OT as the same as Torah

Yes yes and yes  Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and
as shown by archaeology are the same  Kings revivals Temples and all

The Torah as far as I know is the five books of Moses  Then come the
Prophets all the Prophets plus Joshua Judges  Samuel  Kings
and the Writings Psalms Proverbs Lamentations Ruth Esther Ezra
Nehemiah Ecclesiates Song of Songs  Chronicles Job

And the veracity of Isaiah which you quoted to your Moslem friend is
quite well known  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past
 BC and is kept in a Museum in Israel  It was found among the Dead
Sea Scrolls which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the
Old Testament as they date back to around the time of Christ whereas
before the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around  AD

Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken but understandably so  If Jesus
was crucified and atoned for our sins he must have been God for only
the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity  And as
Isaiah predicts the messiah will be called the mighty God  And if he
was God then he must have rose for as St Paul wrote it was not
possible that death could hold him  And if Jesus rose from the dead
your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem  Which is
why he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament

It is also of interest to note that in  on the occasion of a
jubilee Pope Leo the th had a medallion cast with his own image on
one side and on the other side the Church of Rome symbolized as a
Woman holding in her left hand a cross and in her right a cup with
legend around her 'Sedet super universum'  'The whole world is her
seat

	You read more into the medal than it is worth  The Woman is the
Church  Catholics have always called our Church Holy Mother Church
and our Mother  An example would be from St Cyprian of Carthage who
wrote in  AD Can anyone have God for his Father who does not have
the Church for his mother
	Hence the image of the Church as a woman holding a Cross and a Cup
which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord and of the power of His
Blood the grail legend but also more significantly it shows that
This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood which shall be shed
for you and for many Luke  the Cup represents the New Covenant
and holds the blood of redemption  The fact that the woman is holding
both and is said to have the whole world for her seat is that the
Catholic Church is catholic that is universal and is found throughout
the world and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood
of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers thorugh which the
Holy Sacrafice of the Mass can be said and celebrated in all the
nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi  From the rising of the
sun to its setting my name is great among the gentiles and everywhere
there is sacrafice and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation
for my Name is great among the gentiles says the Lord of hosts  And
so we acknowledge what St Paul wrote For as often as you eat this
bread and drink this cup you show the Lord's death until he comes 
Corinthians 

	You are quite right about the identification of Babylon the Great
Mother of all Harlots with Rome  I think we simply disagree as to what
time period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about

Hal Heydt writes

That was only the fall of the Western Empire  The Eastern Empire
continued for another  yearsand a key element in it's fall was
the Christian sack of Constantinople

Note that I said the fall of Rome not of the Empire  The Roman Empire
lasted until  with its transfered capital in Constantinople  The
main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by
the men of the th Crusade who were not Christians  they had been
excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city
of Zara in Croatia but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of
Mazinkert  After the Turks breached the frontier it was only a matter
of time before the Empire fell the inability of the Empire to hold onto
the rim of Anatolia with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle
should be quite obvious to any student of history  The sack of
Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along  For if the Greeks
had wanted to save their empire why would they not cooperate with the
Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the strd
Crusades  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they
considered heretics even though those heretics were fighting for the
cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish
hordes in Anatolia Edessa Lebanon Palastine and Syria the some
hordes who were to later sack Constantinople and overrun a third of
Europe the Balkans Hungary the Ukraine the Caucasus etc

Which Version of the Bible do you consider to be the most
accurate translation

Well knowing Greek and Hebrew I'm probably not as picky about translations
as I would be if English translations were my only source of information
BUT

 Any verse that comes out substantially different in different trans
lations is almost certainly unclear in the original 

 It is very bad practice to shop for a translation that fits your own
doctrinal positions

Personally I still like the RSV  NRSV and NASV are also very good

I have a strong preference for editions that do not indent the beginning
of each verse as if verses were paragraphs  The verse numbering is a
relatively modern addition and should not be given undue prominence

Vera Shanti Noyes writes

this is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination
am i correct  i do not believe in predestination  i believe we all
choose whether or not we will accept God's gift of salvation to us
again fundamental difference which can't really be resolved

Of course I believe in Predestination  It's a very biblical doctrine as
Romans  shows among other passages  Furthermore the Church
has always taught predestination from the very beginning  But to say
that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free
will  Men freely choose the course of their life which is also
affected by the grace of God  However unlike the Calvinists and
Jansenists I hold that grace is resistable otherwise you end up with
the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God  Timothy  
For God must give enough grace to all to be saved  But only the elect
who he foreknew are predestined and receive the grace of final
perserverance which guarantees heaven  This does not mean that those
without that grace can't be saved it just means that god foreknew their
obstinacy and chose not to give it to them knowing they would not need
it as they had freely chosen hell
							  
People who are saved are saved by the grace of God and not by their own
effort for it was God who disposed them to Himself and predestined
them to become saints  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish
because they hardened their heart and chose to perish  Thus they were
deserving of Gods punishment as they had rejected their Creator and
sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit

yes it is up to God to judge  but he will only mete out that
punishment at the last judgement 

Well I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some
blessing for what good they have done even if it was only a little
for those He can't bless in the next life He blesses in this one  And
those He will not punish in the next life will be chastised in this one
or in Purgatory for their sins  Every sin incurs some temporal
punishment thus God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it
cf  Samuel  David's sin of Adultery and Murder were
forgiven but he was still punished with the death of his child  And I
need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is
quite prevelant in the Bible  Sodom and Gommorrah Moses barred from
the Holy Land the slaughter of the Cannanites Annias and Saphira
Jerusalem in  AD etc

 if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman perhaps this is
not a good parallel but i'm going to go with it anyway why should we
not stop the murder and violation of people who may or may not be more
innocent

We should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf Proverbs  but
does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the
US or even the UN involved  I do not think so but I am an
isolationist and disagree with foreign adventures in general  But in
the case of Bosnia I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily
involved it would not be a just war  Blessed after all are the
peacemakers was what Our Lord said not the interventionists  Our
actions in Bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which is
unrelated to anything to justify it for us

Doesn't the Bible say that God is a fair god sic  If this is true
how can this possibly be fair to the infants

What do you mean fair  God is just giving to everyone what they
deserve As all infants are in sin from the time of conception cf
Romans  Psalm  they cannot possibly merit heaven and as
purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins it
is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven  Hence the unbaptized
infants are cut off from the God against whom they with the whole of
the human race except Mary have sinned  Which is why Jesus said
Truly truly I say to you no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless
he is born of water and Spirit which is the true meaning of born again
John   Thus as infants are in sin it is very fair for them to be
cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven

As St Augustine said I did not invent original sin which the
Catholic faith holds from ancient time but you who deny it without a
doubt are a follower of a new heresy  De nuptiis lib c

  Regard homosexual orientation as a sin or evil whatever
  Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin but accept orientation
 though presumably orientation is unfortunate and dislike people who
 indulge
  As  but love the sinner
  Accept homosexuality altogether

I would add ' our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all
people to certain standards of sexual behavior  Promiscuity abuse of power
relationships harrassment compulsivity are equally out of place in the lives
of homosexual as of heterosexual people

Of course this would bring up the dread shibboleth of homosexual marriage

Jerryl Payne writes
To sublimate a culture for the sake of what you perceive as unity seems
antithetical to the very message of inclusion that you preach

I agree with the exception that I don't preach ignoring our cultures

 The body as a whole must be unified The question is shall we be a
melting pot boiling ourselves down to one legitimate expression or
shall we be more like a stew maintaining the textural integrity of the
expressed diversity while upholding the unity of thought   It released
all churches from the use of the Latin Mass unity to allow them to
speak to the people in the common language diversity 

In Revelation  we see that in the first century church there was one
congregation in each major city  So there was one unified church  Now in
each city there were people of different cultures  Naturally they
formed something of a stew with different members having different
heritages  Nevertheless they were ONE body  They met together
sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups
in places such as the temple courts

Now in a particular city then and now you will find that there is a
common language associated with that region  For instance in Rome Latin
was spoken  In the United States today English is spoken  So it would
make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common
language and not necessarily Latin

Naturally you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common
language  In the first century church there were probably many people
in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the
message for people of foreign ethnic groups  Today however you don't
see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons even in socalled
Pentacostal churches  We do have a modern day equivalent though 
bilingual speakers  Now in the unified church of which I am a member 
sometimes called the International Churches of Christ when we all meet
together on Sundays there are headphones on people who don't speak
English from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their
native tongue  Neat idea huh

Now we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays
so sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish
speaking people for example who will hear an evangelist preach in their
native language  In addition we meet in small groups a couple of times
during the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals  So someone
who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also
speak his language assuming the congregation is large enough for those
meetings

As for the people who speak the common language they can keep in touch
with their culture if they want but they will also have equally deep
friendships among their church relationships with people of many various
nationalities  

Has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action

The action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of
Latin  Indeed not  See my second paragraph in response to the second
clipping of your article

However if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a
culture then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted

I'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping

Rather I believe it has been enhanced for Paul exhorts us to become as
one of them that we might reach them Thus if a person or group of
people feel more comfortable among their own shall we not give them a
place where they can feel comfortable with their heritage and still
love God my guess  Aaron

You have met some needs of people certainly by helping them to be proud
of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn't  Yet you have
largely isolated yourselves from having quality Christian friendships
outside your nationality and your denomination

We shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their
heritage  However we will do this in a way that does not destroy church
unity but rather encourages friendships among all disciples

This is the approach of some of the groups that you cite 

It sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions but they are going
about things in the wrong way  And names like the African Methodist
Episcopal Church still make me cringe although not as much as before

I understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such
groups to be formed but now we should try to unite  I know that it's
hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one
body of people on earth but it is quite possible and I am working to
make it happen  However what might be a smaller step towards unity
would be taking the word African out of your denomination's name  Then
perhaps someday a long time off you can also remove the Methodist
Episcopal part also and simply be part of the Church

With regard to inclusivity I note tht your sig emits from MIT As you
know the 'tute is religiously and culturally diversified and not
everyone who comes there is immediately comfortable with English much
less American culture What shall be the conduct of the campus churches
then  shall there be one church for the sake of unity Or shall the
organizations like KCF be useful in helping students new to America make
the transition in culture language and thought

There shall be one church for the sake of unity AND it shall be useful
in helping students new to America make the transition in culture
language and thought  We shouldn't make a new denomination to try to
solve problems  The whole denominational mindset only causes more
problems sadly  

In the AME church we retain African cutlure at the root of our
expression but we are by no means exclusive Since you live in
Cambridge I invite you to visit the local assembly there

Thank you for the invitation  That shows me that you indeed have the
heart to spread the gospel of Jesus as well as take part in your cultural
heritage  Thank you also for responding to my post  I know all too well
how they can be very timeconsuming

The whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions
but I still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same
time  My own church the Boston church has the acapella singing that you
mentioned in your post yet doesn't limit expression of my Mexican
culture even though I am in the MIT Campus ministry and not the Spanish
speaking Zone  I have made a commitment to God that I will go to the
Sunday services of my church because I know that my brothers and sisters
here are fully devoted in love for God as his disciples

I don't believe in tongues as you may have already picked up on because
of my understanding of Biblical Christianity  However I am certainly
willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesn't interfere with
my normal worship  Since you also live in Cambridge I also extend an
invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like  You can
meet the MIT students at the Student Center across from  Mass Ave at
AM on Sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after Wednesday
night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day
My number is  but will be  in a few weeks from now and
for the rest of the summer  Our service normally last from AM to noon
but occasionally are later or earlier  times per year  

Let us always strive to reach all with the gospel by any means necessary
As we move from milk to meat the petty things of the world that
temporally separate us will dissolve away and we shall stand with our
naked realizations that God has shed His grace on all of us His
delightful creation

Definitely

Let's also strive to grow in obedience to the Lord through being men and
women after God's own heart

 theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die This would make
 sense Christ died and his Mother who waited at the foot of the
 cross would want to share in his death

The above article is a good short summary of traditional Christian
teaching concerning the death of Mary  
Also very good is Re Question about the Virgin Mary by Micheal D
Walker  He tells the story very well
I would like to add that in the Eastern Orthodox Church we celebrate The
Dormition or falling asleep of the Theotokos the mother of God  The
Icon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles
who are weeping  Christ in his resurrected glory is there holding what
seems to be a small child  This is in fact Mary's soul already with
Christ in Heaven  The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for us
as Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death  It forshadows the
general resurrection on the last day  The disciples were not surprised
to find Mary's body missing from the grave  She was the Mother of the
Savior  She was the first of all Christians  She gave birth to the Word
of God  If it were not for her we would not be saved  This is why we
pray in the Orthodox Church Through the prayers of the Theotokos
Savior save us

Q If you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that
   unbelievers simply remained dead would you remain a Christian

Interesting question esp since I remember wishing with all
my heart that this were true so that I wouldn't have to be a 
good Christian anymore  Christianity was terribly hard the
only reward was Heaven and maybe sometimes if I was really
good acceptance I wanted a way out

If you knew this beyond all doubt then you would be foolish to be
a disciple of a man who claimed it did exist The truth is you can
not be Jesus' disciple and disagree with him at the same time not
allowing him to be your Lord

What Jesus has done for me since I found Him some  months ago 
I do not want to lose  Period  

That said I originally interpreted the WhatIf as if Christ
never mentioned Sheol and weeping and gnashing of teeth if
Christ preached that those who did not follow him died and stayed
dead and at that point forever ceased to exist

Fearbased religion is not a faithrelationship with the
One Who made us all  I follow Christ because it's a great way
to LIVE life  And I could care less what really happens after
I die  

So is being a Buddhist a great way to live life I'm not converting
though

I believe that we can only be complete through Christ 
Do you think that Buddhists can also be complete

Basically the teaching on infallibility
holds that the pope is infallible in matters of faith and doctrine the
college of bishops is likewise infallible and the laity is as well

Not exactly correct but nice try  The Catholic doctrine of infallibility
refers to freedom from error in teaching of the universal Church in 
matters of faith or MORALS  It is this teaching which is taken as 
doctrine

Well I was certainly turned off by that first paragraph of oftused
platitudes I can't count the times I've heard those common tactics
anymore'you may not believe it but that doesn't change the fact
that it's true'the old analogy about trusting your parentssheesh
Need I point out how parents can show children that they are right
That difference in capability alone crushes that analogy as any 'facts'
about Christianity I have seen turned out to be beliefs What I seek is
factknowledgeif I can get it and evidence for a belief if I can't
So far from Christians I have received neither

Before becoming a Christian I too had problems when I asked one to explain
it to meThe actual evidence is not always what you see on a person's 
outside It should be but is not always
	A very specific somewhat miraculous example of the truth of God
working to help His followers is soemthing that happened to me For nearly
 years after an accident I had severe complications from a triple 
fracture in my left leg and surgerypins put in then removed The bone 
itself was perfectly healed No infectoin that could be detected Yet I 
was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and
bluish More complicatios developed in my other leg none of which could
be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te
northern Illinois region We went everywhereno one could explain it
Durin gthat summer June   to be exact I gave my life and heart
to Christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life which i never
really had anyway because of what he did for me on the cross and the 
fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it I was facing
the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair I was confined to one in 
order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems
were unknown had been in it for about   months before that day
	I found it ore than coincidental that less than  weeks after
I put my faith where my mouth was one more in the long line of doctors
and not even an orthopeodic specialist diagnosed my problems with no
difficulty set me on the path to an effective cure and I was walking
and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for
 years The diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have
overlooked because it was perfectly obvious from my test results
	Maybe this doesn't hit you as miraculous But to me it really
is Imagine an active  year old being told she may not be able to
walk mcuh longerand is now a happy  year old who can dance and run
knowing that the problem was there all along and was revealed just
after she did what she knew was right As the song says
	Our God is an awesome God

 I have a simple test I take several people who can speak
 only one language eg chinese russian german english
 Then I let the gifted one start speaking in toungues
 The audience should understand the gifted one clearly
 in their native language However the gifted one can
 only hear himself speaking in his own language
 Works everytime 

This thread si starting to get really silly Such nonsense do not
belong in src and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on
this issue

We chose to believe whetever we want but we are not allowed to define
our own Christianity we see in parts If you see something that I do
not see or vice versa it does not give me the right to play jokes on
your belief

There is no wonder that your miracle does not work You designet it
yourself and even if you were able to collect a group of people like
the one you describe I see no reason why your miracle should really
happen God is the one who does miracles not humans

After all we are all on the same way or at least we are all headed
for the same goal following different paths Remember that we are
going to spend eternity together If I can not stand your view here on
earth how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you

Tongues is a question of belief Not wether you believe in Jesus but
if you believe that He is able to give you this gift Just as any
other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible But there is no evidence in
the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way
better than others

 Perhaps I would believe the gifted ones more if they were
 glorifying God rather than themselves Then perhaps we'd
 witness a real miracle

Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more
interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God I don't know
But if this is the case it still does not suggest that the gifts are
faked

In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles He
said that I do nothing except what my father tells me Perhaps it
woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that
example

In Him

   STILL the Angel Gabriel's greetings was
   Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with you

   Even Mary was confused about this greeting

There are various explanations for her reaction to the angel's
greeting  One is that she grasped what the angel was getting at that
she was to be the mother of the Messiah  And knew what this entailed
all the suffering  This gave her a moment's pause

Regarding the consequences of the original sin

Catholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin for
himself and the human race was sanctifying grace  This is basically
a share in the Divine life  Take a rock and make it able to talk
what God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar
It makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers
of any possible creature  This is the everlasting life that the New
Testament speaks of

What Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying
grace to the human race  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by
which this life is given to people and its increase fostered

The absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion
from Heaven  The nature of Heaven is such that it's impossible for a
human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying
grace  To use my example it would be like taking that rock and
attempting to hold a conversation with it rocks cannot talk  Neither
can human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace

This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults since
both have souls  Infants must be baptized therefore or they cannot
enter into Heaven  They too need this form of life in them or they
cannot enter into Heaven

Turning it around infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the
Catholic belief in sanctifying grace  Unless Baptism causes some
change in an infant's soul there is no particular reason to insist on
the practice  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the
Apostles themselves and was certainly part of the Church shortly
thereafter

There is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself 
Cor  Acts    also Acts   It is known for
sure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as an
infant St Polycarp because of a remark he makes in the acts of his
martyrdom  St Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as
infants  There is direct evidence in St  Irenaeus's Against
Heresies and in Tertullian's On Baptism  All these so far
mentioned are in the first  years after our Lord's death  After
that there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice

The following is a juxtaposition of part of an ancient text known as
de Sacramentis usually attributed to St Ambrose of Milan and the
canon of the traditional Catholic Mass of the Roman rite  The
conclusion from this comparison is that the central part of the
traditional Roman canon was already fairly well in place by sometime
in the late th century

Taken from The Mass of the Western Rites by the Right Reverend Dom
Fernand Cabrol Abbot of Farnborough  without permission

SEVENTH CENTURIES  The paragraph at the end is from the book not me

There is no doubt that we have here two editions of the same
text and as that of De Sacramentis is localised in Upper Italy
and dated about the year  it is the most ancient witness we
possess as to the principal parts of the Roman canon which only
appear in the Sacramentaries some time after the seventh
century The question as to whether the Roman canon is not older
even than that of De Sacramentis is discussed by
liturgiologists  Mgr Batiffol is of this opinion but we on
the contrary think that the former bears traces of closer
composition of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy and that
consequently it is a text corrected from De Sacramentis We
shall see in studying the list of names in the Memento of the
living and that of the dead that Mgr Batiffol argues with good
reason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of
Symmachus  We thus have the state of the Roman Mass
or at least of the chief parts of the canon at the beginning of
the fourth century

I'd like to field this one if I may  Although I am a believer in and follower
of Christ my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive  In
fact there was one point in my life when for about three days I simply
couldn't believe in the existence of God  Anyway when I look back upon the
troubles I've had they seem to fall into two categories  impulses to
unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions and impulses to unbelief
that resulted from frustration with God

The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore as I have worked through
most of the arguments for the nonexistence of God  But way back when these
would cause me some problems and I would have to struggle with my faith to
continue to believe  I can see where others less stubborn than I and I do
mean stubborn  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between
me an atheism from time to time would fail

The second category arises out of some longterm personal difficulties and
the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my 
life as others would tell me how God would have me live it  A good example of
this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet  I am not nor
have I ever been on fire for Chirst and I don't think I ever want to be
Nevertheless I am not lukewarm about my faith so I don't really
fit in with the mainstream either  Quite naturally I feel a lot of anxiety
about my dislocation within Christian society and it can lead to a lot of
internal tension when I want to do what I know is right
but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because
all the other Christians think so to  Quite naturally this tension has a
destructive effect on my relationship with God and during all of this internal
strife there's atheism sitting there like the promised land  no rules no
responsibilities no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own
Complete freedom  Of course it's all an illusion but nevertheless it's a
very appealing illusion especially when the socalled people of God are
behaving like total twits  I can easily understand why someone would go
that route and would be hostile to ever coming back

IMHO many of the formerChristiansturnedatheistswhoarenowactively
hostiletoChristianity are so because their experience with Christ and God
wasn't a very peaceful one but one of mindcontrol and shutupanddowhat
you'retoldbecauseweknowwhat'sbestforyoubecauseit'sGod'swilland
you'retoyoungtoknowwhatGod'swillisyet courtesy of some of Christ's
more overzealous followers  

A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a
very good reputation right now  One of the things that attracted people to
Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had
for one another and the world around them  Unlike the rest of the world
Christian communities actively cared for their poor and the Christian rich
did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers but bent down to help
them  Christians were known for living exemplary lives even if they were
thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the
emporer  Nowadays courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost
Christ on their way to power people see Christians as sexuallyrepressed
hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of 
their own moral view

There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists but I don't have time
to go into them right now

    First point What they are doing is wrong just as what
Joseph's brothers did was wrong just as what Judas did was wrong
They intend it for evil If God somehow brings good out of it that
does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and
punishment
     Second point Of course God will bring good out of it But not
the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had
refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder Nor does the
good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right


So what you're saying then is that God exercises direct control or
influence upon humanity He doesn't control our every thought or action
but takes what we do whether it be intended for evil or not and turns
it into something good It seems to me that this idea conflicts with
the belief that God gave humans FREE WILL As far as I can determine
it is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas If God were to
exert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime he would be 
impeding upon someone's free will Unless of course you believe that
God did not give us complete and unabated free will but rather some sort
of conditional free will Something that allows us to make our own choices
and control our own lives except when God wants to use us to fulfill some
good purpose of his own by hardening our heart or controlling us in some
other way I hear alot of people who look at various events mostly 
catastrophies or things like the AIDS epidemic and make comments about
God's will I have a very difficult time understanding why people believe
that God controls anything that happens on this planet Except possibly
when being asked to through someone's prayer According to the Bible
Pharoah was going to let Moses' people go after one or two plagues but
God kept hardening his heart so Moses could cast all  plagues upon the
Egyptians the last plague causing the death of many innocent children
So then God impeded upon Pharoah's free will and used him as a puppet
God did this not just to free the Hebrews but to free them in some sort
of a grand fashion I suppose from the Hebrew's point of view this could
be seen as turning something bad into good but I'm sure the Egyptians didn't
see it this way All of your examples of how God turned something bad into
something good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over
another After all it's only good based upon your point of view Why does
God who is supposed to be the god of all of humanity play favorites

Woo So far we've had the following interpretations of the figure of
the Whore of Babylon' in Rev   

a The United States of America
b MHO dB which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who
   corrupt and oppress human society
c Historical Jerusalem
d Historical Rome

Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning How
about  The prophecy reveals God's judgement on the corrupt  idolatrous
state oppressing his chosen people d  That God's judgement extends
especially to his once chosen city c because despite that City's
special call it still rejected God's grace at the decisive time Rev
  also isn't Rev equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem 
That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of RomeBabylon a and
is equally subject to God's judgement  That the Good BookTM actually
encompasses all these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual
powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've
created b

Clever huh  Flame here No need to argue at all 

I think Mary's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a
deliberate contrast between Rev  and Rev   the mortal
Jerusalem chosen by God but never historically fulfilling its vocation
and the new Jerusalem perfected outside of history purely by God's
grace eg Details like Rev   who sits on many waters' cf Rev 
the single stream in the new Jersualem the river of life flowing from
the throne of God and of the Lamb'

mystery religions to all this Please elaborate your ideas about OT

What is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal
suffering  If it is Biblical please reference

Here's my train of thought If God is using the Earth to manufacture
heavenly beings then it is logical that there would be a certain
yield and a certain amount of waste  The yield goes to Heaven and
the waste is burned destroyed in Hell  Why is it necessary to
punish the waste rather than just destroy it

Peace and joy

As a final note the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign
a common statement of Christology in which the heresey of Monophysitism
was condemned So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in
Monophysitism

This is a point that seems to have been overlooked by many The ending of a 
 year old schism seems to be in sight

The theologians said that the differences between them were fundamentally 
ones or terminology and that the Christological faith of both groups was 
the same

Some parishes have concelebrated the Eucharist and here in Southern Africa 
we are running a joint theological training course for Coptic and Byzantine 
Orthodox 

There are still several things to be sorted out however As far as the 
Copts are concerned there were three ecumenical councils whily the

	I Timothy 
	Jude 
	II Peter 
	Gen 
	Lev  
to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality

But wouldn't that go for any sin  My father told me when he was growing
up Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced
There are a few verses prohibitting divorce  Somehow divorce became
acceptable even in Catholicism anullments  Certainly it is no longer
a sin to associate with a divorced person  The point is that each person
has their own temptations to deal with  Paul repeatedly talks about the
thorn in his side some think it refers to lust others pride but
who knows  Whatever the thorn was apparently it was not compatible
with Christianity yet does that make his epistles any less  The Bible
warns us against judging greed anxiety impure thoughts bearing grudges
etc etc  I suppose we should seek out all the socalled Christians
who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them  All those who have
given in to greed get 'em outta here  Jesus pointed out that he
was the physician for the sinners  Any attempts to make homosexuals
feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible
with Christianity  Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone
try to become closer to Jesus we need to keep them away  Does Jesus need
us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin  Do we really mistrust 
Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin

Think about it  Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners and
the Pharisees  The sinners he embraced and forgave  The Pharisees
hypocritcal unmerciful selfrighteous pointed out others sins and
did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins  What
I take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins
those sins will not be forgiven  And since those guilty of even one sin
are guilty of the whole law those not repenting the judging of others
are guilty as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others
of

The poor in spirit meek humble merciful pure of heart peacemakers 
those who thirst for justice those who suffer for His sake are blessed

There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter
One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was
written by their enemies  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret
information to Peter James and John after His resurrection and that
those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve
Eusebius Historia Ecclesiastica II 

This is curious I read in EH

The Lord imparted the gift of knowledge to James the Just to John 
and Peter after his resurrection these delivered it to the rest of 
the apostles and they to the seventy of whom Barnabas was one
			 
			 Eusebius Ecclesiastical History

It seems that the Lord imparted the gift of knowledge not that the
Lord imparted secret information



apostles  Interestingly enough Eusebius refers to the groups which
we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis Eusebius
op cit III   His gripe was not that thay professed a
gnosis but that they had the wrong one

I'm afraid that I cannot find this portrayal in EH 
I don't see anywhere in  where Eusebius mentions that certain 
gnostics had the wrong gnosis

The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus' statements 
whilst if there were any at all that attempted to pervert 
the sound doctrine of the saving gospel they were yet skulking 
in dark retreats

Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways  I
don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do but I
believe that evidence exists favorably interpreted of course of
early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today

Favorably interpreted Just in looking at two of the four 
references that you gave I have the EH handy Irenaeus and the 
Clemetine Recognitions I will have to look for I see no room for 
such 'interpretations'

And any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to 
the Temple Ceremonies 

The links for Jay's using EH for support are imparting the gift 
of knowledge  imparted secret information  being given secret 
signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven  But there is not
enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call 
this favorable interpretation  It appears to be closer to 
fabrication

     Could anyone enlighten me on how the Mormon church views 
 children born out of wedlock  In particular I'm interested to know if any 
 stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents  I'm especially 
 keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on 
 bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big  
genealogical 
 book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City  If this is an issue on which the 
 official position has changed over time I'm interested in learning both  
old 
 and new beliefs  Email or posting is fine  All information or pointers are 
 appreciated
 

Well since my wife is in your gentle term a bastard I can
probably speak with a bit of authority on this Any stigma
associated with children conceived andor born out of wedlock rests
solely upon the parentsthey've committed a sexual transgression for
which they should repent The child itself has no a priori limitations
on him or her indeed the concept of blaming the child for the
parents' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling note that LDS
theology rejects original sin as the term is usually defined and the
subsequent need for infant baptism cf Moroni  in the Book of
Mormon  Indeed LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly cf DC  note that this
passage applies it only to members of the LDS Church

Also note that there is no big genealogical book in Salt Lake City
The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains
containing on microfilm vital statistic records birth christening
baptism marriage death gathered from all over the entire world I
may be misremembering but I believe they have records for some 
billion people in that vault At the same time the LDS Church is
building up an online genealogical database In neither case is there
some kind of worthiness screening as to whether someone can be
entered in The only potential issue is that of establishing who the
parents were and that would apply only in the case of the database

You might visit some congregations of Christians who happen to be homosexuals

Gee I think there are some real criminals robbers muderers drug
addicts who appear to be fun loving caring people too  So what's
your point  Is it OK just because the people are nice

Isn't Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issue
he can especially homosexuality  Let's reach the homosexuals for Christ 
Let's not try to change them just need to bring them to Christ  If He
doesn't want them to be gay He can change that  If they are living a moral
life committed to someone of the same sex and God is moving in their lives
who are we to tell them they have to change


I think the old saying  hate the sin and not the sinner is
appropriate here  Many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably
don't hate the people  I don't  I don't hate my kids when they do
wrong either  But I tell them what is right and if they lie or don't
admit they are wrong or just don't make an effort to improve or
repent they get punished  I think this is quite appropriate  You
may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here
Maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through
feel goodism  Maybe he is trying to convince you that you know more
than God  Kind of like the Adam and Eve story  Read it and compare
it to today's mentality  You may be suprised

christians can also feel that
sense of difference however when they are associated with those
weird televangelists who always talk about satan  if you'll excuse
the cliched sound of this everyone has to deal with his her
differences from other people i can understand how being an atheist
could be hard for you being a christian is sometimes hard for me

This is not at all comparable Christianity is the main stream in
western culture You are trivializing the experiences of others

I remember what it was like being different as a Christian We
were told all the time that we were different and in fact that
only members of the our church were really Christians though others
who believed in God weren't as bad as atheists so we were a small
minority That was nothing compared to being an atheist

The only thing comparable would be a young child being Christian
being surrounded by staunch atheists including parents who
actively persecute any religious tendancies  both actual punishments
and even worse emotional blackmail They would also have
to have the whole mainstream society on their side Maybe these
conditions could have occured in the old Soviet Union not in a
country with under God in its pledge of allegiance

 I doubt it even then because children have to be taught to be
Christians and hence must have support somewhere

I have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and
having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves
because I've been there Only in my case it was my rationality instead
of sexuality which I was forced to try to repress

in some way the pressures were different of course because you
chose your beliefs  or are you saying that they were not your
choice but born of necessity  please no flames about whether or
not gay people choose their lifestyle  that's elsewhere in this
newsgroup

Yes My atheism was born of necessity For an intellectually honest
person belief is mostly a response to evidence Will or wishes have
nothing to do with it I could choose to lie or to be silent about
my true beliefs I could no more choose to believe in the God of
Christianity than I could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to
me Still I should be clear that I'm not equating what I went through
with what gays go through However it is a mistake to assume that
everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them
Happily some are made stronger once we get past it

 I must say that I
wasn't hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends
who didn't become atheists I was just hurt differently

i'm not sure i understand this sentence  could you explain

Not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my
childhood friends Suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee
that a person will be happy and strong emotionally and a repressive
upbringing can leave its scars even or especially on those who don't
get free of it I doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and
I feel no need to defend it

By the way I am much happier and stronger being out of the closet In
the end it has been as someone eloquently put it in private email an
experience of liberation rather than disillusion

Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say
fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God  How does this apply

marriage  Is this an accurate definition  Is there any such thing as
samesex marriage in the Bible  My understanding has always been that
the New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband
and his wife  I am however willing to listen to Scriptural evidence
to the contrary

You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an
abomination  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to
be defiled with it nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate
with it it is a perversion  Lev 

I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse  I know
of no New Testament passages that clearly condemn or even mention
intercourse with animals  Do those who argue for the legitimacy of
homosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a
perversion and if so why  That is what verses would you cite to
prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful  Could the verses you
cite be refuted by interpreting them differently  Can one be a
Christian zoophile

By the way I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not
choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and
sinful so please understand that I am not asking these questions out
of an antipathy towards my fellow people of alternative
orientations  I do believe however that one should read the Bible
with an attitude of what is the Bible trying to say and not what do
I WANT the Bible to say  I choose not to give in to my perverted
sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me whether I
like it or not that such things are sin  It is frustrating at times
and I have had days where it really got me down but I don't blame God
for this I blame the sin itself

 Mark

There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage
you quote  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that
homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals but is likely to
have a meaning like homosexual prostitute  That doesn't meant that I
think all the Biblical evidence vanishes but the nature of the
evidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things

I think your argument from fornication is circular  Why is
homosexuality wrong  Because it's fornication  Why is it
fornication  Because they're not married  Why aren't they married
Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony  Why does the
church refuse to do a marriage ceremony  Because homosexuality is
wrong  In order to break the circle there's got to be some other
reason to think homosexuality is wrong

 I see no other way of interpreting them other than homosexuyality
 being wrong  Please tell me how these verses can be interpreted in
 any other way  I read them and the surrounding text

But that is exactly what I was asking If the Homosexual community is that
the proper term has decided that Christianity is not against Homosexual 
behaviour but rather condones it then how do they interpret these verses I
guess what I am really looking for is a homosexual response

I hate to sound flippant having shot off my mouth badly on the net
before but I'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my
feeling that the assumption of Mary would be better phrased our
assumptions about Mary  In all the time I've been reading about
Mary on this group I can not recall reading much about Mary that
did not sound like wishful veneration with scant if any Scriptural
foundation  

I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ's parents
as compellingly human persons to be honored and admired for their
humility and submission to God's working beyond doubt  But the almalga
mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me
an image of alien and inhuman creatures untouched by sin or human
desire  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified and even He knew
temptation albeit without submitting to it

I also don't see the necessity of saying the Holy Parents were some
how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or
dinary human being  

I won't start yelling about how people are worshipping Mary etc
since folks have told me otherwise about that but I do think we
lose part of the wonder of God's Incarnation in Christ when we make
his parents out to be sinless sexless deathless otherworldly beings

In article Mayathosrutgersedu dbnandrewcmuedu D Andrew Byler writes
does he believe in predestination
Of course I believe in Predestination  It's a very biblical doctrine as
Romans  shows among other passages  Furthermore the Church
has always taught predestination from the very beginning 

really  you may be right but i'd like proof  as far as i know and
i am not a div school student the catholic church does not seem to
accept predestination  my chaplain told me beware of greeks bearing
gifts with reference to this doctrine it seems to have the curious
result that human beings are not held responsible for their own
actions  i'll answer how you deal with this in a minute

But to say
that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free
will  Men freely choose the course of their life which is also
affected by the grace of God  However unlike the Calvinists and
Jansenists I hold that grace is resistable otherwise you end up with
the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God  Timothy  

right  that doesn't really seem like predestination to me but i'll
continue with what you're saying

For God must give enough grace to all to be saved  But only the elect
who he foreknew are predestined and receive the grace of final
perserverance which guarantees heaven  This does not mean that those
without that grace can't be saved it just means that god foreknew their
obstinacy and chose not to give it to them knowing they would not need
it as they had freely chosen hell

this is really confusing to me especially since i still believe that
christ jesus died for ALL of us  preknowledge of obstinacy seems
like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses  but
then i am not really biblically supported in this opinion  or am i
others

People who are saved are saved by the grace of God and not by their own
effort for it was God who disposed them to Himself and predestined
them to become saints  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish
because they hardened their heart and chose to perish  Thus they were
deserving of Gods punishment as they had rejected their Creator and
sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit

so God uses grace like margarine he only spreads it where it's needed
and not where it isn't  and so there are the saved and the notsaved
and nothing in between  hmmmm

yes it is up to God to judge  but he will only mete out that
punishment at the last judgement 

Well I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some
blessing for what good they have done even if it was only a little
for those He can't bless in the next life He blesses in this one  

although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause
social problems it ends up doing just that  if there is supposed to
be some sort of sign that someone is elect like lots of children or
success at work then those who have a good life on earth will go
around thinking that those who don't are doomed to hell

in a way though this sounds like the opposite idea  those doomed
to hell will have a great life on earth  that's almost like the
converse of what i believe  responsibility for what we do now will
be punished after we die  you're saying what we get after we die has
a direct bearing on how we live now  strange
 
And
those He will not punish in the next life will be chastised in this one
or in Purgatory for their sins  Every sin incurs some temporal
punishment thus God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it
cf  Samuel  David's sin of Adultery and Murder were
forgiven but he was still punished with the death of his child  And I
need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is
quite prevelant in the Bible  Sodom and Gommorrah Moses barred from
the Holy Land the slaughter of the Cannanites Annias and Saphira
Jerusalem in  AD etc

so sin is either punished now or later  and not both  what if it's
 sort of halfpunished  are there any grey areas in this doctrine

 my stuff deleted
 We should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf Proverbs  but
 does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the
 US or even the UN involved  I do not think so but I am an
 isolationist and disagree with foreign adventures in general  But in
 the case of Bosnia I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily
 involved it would not be a just war  Blessed after all are the
 peacemakers was what Our Lord said not the interventionists  Our
 actions in Bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which is
 unrelated to anything to justify it for us

 the idea well my idea would be that you would intervene to
 establish peace and stop the atrocities  i'm not suggesting wwIII  i
 don't really understand what you mean by a just war  of course i am
 not an isolationist although i see some merit in not jumping in at
 the first opportunity can you say kuwait  we happen to be a big
 country with a lot of resources as well as a lot of debt and this
 gives us some responsibility in the world whether we like it or not
 flashbacks of wwII as well as vietnam should be haunting us

 yet another difference of opinion  so be it

And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria
also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation even though they
broke away from the unity of the Chruch in  AD by rejecting the
Council of Chalcedon  It might be argued by some Protestants that the
Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up but the Monophysites put a
big hole in that notion as they also hold the belief and they split
from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing as
far as is known much has been lost from the time of the Fathers

The belief that the churches of Egypt and Syria were or are monophysite is 
false as is the belief that they often held that the Council of Chalcedon 
was Nestorian

These misunderstandings were exacerbated by political factors and thus led 
to schism  a schism that is on its way to being healed

  there is nothing in Christianity that precludes the idea of
  repeated lives on earth

Doesn't it say somewhere It is appointed to man once to die
and then judgement I don't have a concordance here but I have
some dim memory that this appears somewhere in the Bible
Given a fairly specific context for what judgement is I'd say
that more or less decides the issue
Heb  clh

That depends on how this verse is read  There are at least two
meanings of the word once   only one time and  at some
other time ie once upon a time  Note that in the previous
verse the word once is used with the second meaning and also
in the following verse once is again used with the second meaning
The Greek I am sure uses different words for each of the two meanings
for the English word once  I am not a Greek scholar but I'm sure
someone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning
If the second meaning is being used that verse can be interpreted as

   for it was once given for men to die beginning with Adam but 
    after this gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ the judgement
    is made available for now there is no longer death but life
    with Christ

 Yes  My comments were long enough that I don't want to repeat
 them here but I'll send them via email back to the author
 Certainly it was not intended to be a description of three similar
 deities though I certainly see why it would look that way
 
Thanks for the letter your comments helped some

As to the last comment I certainly realize that it was not intended to
sound that way  I am still trying to understand how a spiritual being
colud truly be one and three at the same time  All of the descriptions
of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading sort of
they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways but really they are
one trust me

Neither of these is acceptible to me

The fact is so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any
sense to me are the modalistic ones such as Modalistic Monarchianism
or Economic Trinitarianism  I can accept that the three aspects are
intrinsic to the nature of God so I perhaps lean more towards the latter

I am trying here to see if anybody can come up with another description
that is both orthodox and believable

 
sarimateradatacom			formerly tdatirvsarima
  or
StanleyFriesenElSegundoCAncrcom

I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox to
the extent that wellmeaning people think they've just flatout
confused  There's no problem with things being both  and  eg  if
the  are different parts of the   Father Son and Holy Spirit
aren't exactly parts of God because parts are things distinguished by
physical separation  All three Persons are omnipresent so they are
obviously aren't physically separate  But they're in some way
different aspects modes or whatever of one God  If you accept
economic trinitarianism it's possible that you don't have any
substantive difference with the standard view  Is it possible that
you just don't find the neoPlatonic explanation illuminating

As a final note the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a
common statement of Christology in which the heresey of Monophysitism
was condemned So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in
Monophysitism

Sorry

What does the Coptic Church believe about the will and energy of Christ
 Were there one or were there two ie Human and Divine wills and
energies in Him

Also what is the objection ot the Copts with the Pope of Rome ie why
is there a Coptic Catholic Church  Do you reject the supreme
jurisdiction of the rd sucessor of St Peter who blessed St John
Mark Bishop of Alexandria was translator for and his predecessors  Or
his infallibility  Or what other things perhaps

For your first set of questions regarding the energy and will of Christ
I quote to you the relevant part of the Statement signed by both Eastern
Chalcedonian and Oriental nonChalcedonian Orthodox scholars a few
years ago Both families  both Orthodox churches 

 Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy Both  families
confess that the Logos the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity only begotten
of the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him was incarnate and
was born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos fully consubstantial with us perfect
man with soul body and mind    nu o  upsilon zeta  He  was crucified
died was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day ascended   to the
Heavenly Father where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all
creation At  Pentecost by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the
Church as His Body We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His
glory according to the Scriptures

 Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the cryptoNestorianism of
Theodoret of  Cyrus They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that
Christ is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us by  nature God and
by nature man it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos Who is by nature
God  became by  nature   man by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time

 Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by
uniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy which
He has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit created human nature
which He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own with its natural will
and energy

 Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills
   
are united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion without  change

without  division and without separation  and that they are distinguished  in

thought alone


 Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis
of the Logos Incarnate



I guess that adresses your question adequately

As for your second set of questions I am afraid they are irrelevant to the
discussion at least from my point of view of Monophysitism I do not see
how they relate to the topic we are discussing other than to start an
endless OrthodoxRC debate which I do not plan to engage into As a brief
answer to your questions the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church 
regarding the Roman pontiff his jurisdiction his infalability etc
is exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches

Without quoting at length from the preceeding post I'd just like
to say that I find it a much more appropriate way of dealing with
issues like the Holocaust and Bosnia that asserting that God is
punishing them

The activity of God is always redemptive which means restoring
what has been lost broken or distorted  So God does not will
the brokenness lostness distortion genocide poverty etc but
is nonetheless capable willing and active to restore heal mend

of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got
rejected who didn't intend heresy but simply used language that was
not understood or even was mispresented  And some seem not to have
jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine  There are
							     
groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps  This
 
posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians  There are also
a remaining Nestorians  Like some of the current socalled
monophysites there is reason to believe that the current socalled
Nestorians are not heretical either  They sheltered Nestorius from
what they saw as unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his
heresies and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of
the Antiochene tradition

clh

There is a BIG difference between the status of what you refer to as
Alexandrians actually this includes all Oriental Orthodox Churches
and not only Copts and that of Nestorians The Oriental Orthodox
Churches never even shelter Eutyches the advocator of Monophysitism
but on the contrary it condemned and still does condemn him and his
heresy That is why the Eastren Chalcedonian Orthodox Church held
talks with the Oriental nonChalcedonian that started  years ago
and still continueing till today but they have converged on many
issues the most imporatant of which is Christology I have more 
details of the interOrthodox dialogue in case anyone is interested
So I do not see how the Alexandrians and the Nestorians are in a
similar position

The socalled Creed of Athanasius however has always been a Western
creed and has always had the filioque  The Orthodox have said that
they accept all that it says with the exception of the filioque but
it is not in use

	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene
Creed it wasn't there to begin with but they certainly did from the
Athanasian Creed which did have it from the beginning

The socalled Athanasian Creed has never been a recognized standard of faith

 Ok a few days back the belowincluded message was posted stating 
 
      I believe with everything in my heart that on May   the city of
 Portland Oregon in the country of the United States of America will be hit
 with a catastrophic and disastrous earthquake
 
 By now we know that this did not come to pass
 
 I don't think it's particularly 
 glorifying to God to say things like Well I THINK the Lord is telling me 
 Such statements seem to me to be an attempt to get a spiritual thrill should 
 the guess happen to come true without risking the guilt of false prophecy 
 should it fail to come to pass  I do not believe genuine prophecy was ever 
 like this  Comments
 

I agree   People should not be misled to believe thus sayeth the Lord by
innuendo or opinion or speculation

Speak directly  If the Lord has given you something to say say it
But before I declare thus sayeth the Lord I'd better know for certain
without a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition
and relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely
certain again without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no
possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining
recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers

Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous  For me my greatest fears
in this area would be the following

that the people would be misled
that people would lose respect for christianity
that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies
were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word
   my calling would be lost forever  God's Word would command the people
   never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet  My
   bridges would be burnt forever  Perhaps I could repent and be saved but
   I could never again be a prophet of God

In the light of this it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak
and that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the
world of God's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate
cowardly silence or by our false statements  And because of this it
is critically important that we remain close to the Lord in His Word and
in prayer and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference

In this day and age sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging
one another claiming rights that are not theirs denying rights that do
indeed belong to others demanding equal respect for all the gods of this
world and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel
good

It's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in
contrast against this backdrop of falsehood  When we say thus sayeth the
Lord it happens  When we pray prayer is answered because we prayed right
When we say we're christians we really mean it

 On The Athanasian Creed

Do you have any evidence that it is used by the Orthodox Churches

As far as I know it is purely Western like the Apostles' Creed The
Orthodox Churches use the Symbol of Faith commonly called The
Nicene Creed

I have seen it used in an Orthodox church once although I can't recall why
I found it odd to say the least  Also I object to the statement that the
Orthodox DELETE the filioque from the original form of the Creed

The creed originally did NOT contain that phrase and it is not present
in the Greek original which hangs by my desk  Not intending to start a
flame war  We didn't need to delete what wasn't there

The only problem with this is that Jesus does use hell as a threat
He doesn't sound like some of the more extreme fire and brimstone
preachers and I don't think he wants people to live in abject fear
But he talks a lot about people being found unworthy and mentions
hell a number of times  I agree that it might be more pleasant to
think that it doesn't exist  I certainly don't agree that God is some
sort of sadist who tortures people forever  But I am very much afraid
that there really is a life and death spiritual struggle going on and
that it is possible for people to lose in a serious way  clh

No disagreement at all that there is a VERY serious struggle going on
But Jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat  That's quite
different from Hell Classic TM  Jesus doesn't sound like the
usual hellfire type of preacher  He attracts people through what he
does And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of 
Lazarus and Dives which is a parable  In any case my point is that
a fearbased response to Christ is not a freeing lifeaffirming choice
and isn't Good News in a meaningful sense  There are plenty of good 
reasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal 
hell that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between 
God and the Disloyal Opposition  A faith based in fear is not built
on Rock as we should found our faith but on ice  If the fear were
removed there would BE no foundation  

That's basically why it matters to me  I think we have many Christians 
that DON'T have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God
I cannot be fully open to the working of God in and through my life if
my response to God is motivated on fear

 You might want to rethink your attitude about the Holocaust after
 reading Deuteronomy chapter 

On the contrary after the Holocaust I would be very cautious about my
interpretatoin of Deuteronomy   Not everything that happens is in
accordance with God's will  You might guess which side of the
predestination issue I am on  I will never assume that evil is 
punishment by God especially when I am speaking of the evil that falls on
someone else  For my own life I will work to discern the hand of God
in the evil that befalls me

hey folks

I'm fairly new to these groups tho' some have heard from me before

I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot  What moralsethics apply to dreams and outofbody incidents
In normal dreams you can't control anything so obviously
you aren't morally responsible for your actions  But if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE it seems like a morality applies

Now there seem to be  alternatives

 Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena  In this case no morality
applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene' that is not trying
to think about anything evil or indulgining in overly sexy or violent
thoughts

 Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own ie are 'another plane'
Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in
common by more than one person  A
mark of objective fact is that  people report the same objective experience
In this case the same interpersonal moralityethics applies in dreams and
OOBEs as does in waking life

 Like  but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a
real existence a different moralethics apply there and no or maybe 
different moral laws apply there

So There it is  Is one of these cases the truth or does anyone know
of another alternative  respond by post or email

thanks very much

In all candor I would be happy to be proven wrong about believing  
in atheism  Problem is I will have to be proven wrong

In mentioning some nonsense about psychology  and atheism Bob Muir asks
the following question   

No smiley on the part about atheism I see Do you realize that your
statement says that I was mentioning nonsense about atheism This is
hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making as you
have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the
first Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it
out of hand 
But because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English I may be
misinterpreting your wording here Please clarify did you or did you not
mean to call my statements about atheism nonsense If so care to back
up that claim

	Do I sound broken to you

I answer in the affirmative

OK then Start up the amatuer psycology again How am I broken

Is it politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group
permitted the luxury of arrogance   

YAWN Excuse me I don't recall any portion of my post in which I called
Christians arrogant quote me if I did I do remember calling Christianity
silly and then following that up with information that I was nine years
old when I thought that I also said that I find faith to be intellectually
dishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's
existence I define faith as belief in the absense of any proof BTW

Also I subscribe to aa as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types
there so in answer to your question no

Finally I'd hardly call Christianity beseiged in this country I seldom
see Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing
crosses or having Christian bumper stickers I don't know for sure of
course I only say I haven't seen it happening What I have seen happening
is my homosexual andor friends being beat up or preached at by people
who claim to be Christ's followers I know that this sort of thing isn't
practiced by the majority of Christians but it is a very vocal minority
who are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians 

Now I have a question for Bob  Why in the world would any selfrespecting
atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group  

The implication being that I am not selfrespecting of course I'm not a
student of psychology BTW but I am a student of Creative Writing and
Linguistics so literary analysis is my forte Also if the implications
I see are improper please let me know
I'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as
you seem to think atheists should be Did it occur to you that I don't
think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that
will change my life Have you read my other posts here or did you see
atheist and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve
your respect
Aw geez I'm sorry I probably am getting my back up a little too high
here It's just that the nonsense thing really annoys me I figure you
should see my first reactions though since they are my true reactions to
your question
Now the smoothed feather version
I seek all sorts of knowledge That's why I came to my university Yes I
am looking at your religion well sorta I have no idea what kind of
Christian you are from the outside and hopefully with an objective view
I've been trying to ask reasoned questions here because I genuinely don't
know the answers to them but when I saw the question directed at atheists
I figured I would answer After all you can speculate about atheist
motives here all you want hence the amatuer psychology crack but
without an atheist you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive       
I'm hoping people really
want to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several
religions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I
actually think about these things Instead I'm still faced with the
implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only broken
people are atheist
	Try it from the flip side I posit that atheism is the natural
state and only broken people are theists I offer as proof that so many
people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they 
discovered their religion that religion is regional if people didn't
follow the religion of their areas there would be a more homogenous
mix so many terrorists claim theistic motives and that theists tend
to be so pushy and angry when challenged on altatheism Why are religions
so successful Because there is so much suffering in the world which 
breaks people
It's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it which is another
reason I'm here to try to see the flip side of my thinking and also as 
a watchdog for logical fallacies 
I have a 
difficult enough time keeping up with it and I think I know something
                                           
about the subject     
 
The implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything
about Christianity Probably jumping at shadows again but I think my
reaction is somewhat justified After all the first post suggested that
atheists are broken hostile people This post confirms that someone
else believes it 


Bob reminds me of my roommate  In order to disbelieve atheism he says 
                                             
he will need to be proven wrong about it 

Well he got me there I am a strong atheist because I feel that lack of
evidence especially about something like an omnipotent being implies
lack of existence However I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said
that nothing could ever persuade him Call me a seeker if you like I
don't 
Weak atheism is being ignore here though Some atheists simply say I
don't believe in any god rather than my position I believe that no
gods exist For the weak atheist the is no atheism to disbelieve
because they don't actively believe in atheism If you think this is
confusing try figuring out the difference between Protestants and
Methodists from an atheist point of view 
This is another fallacy many theists seem to have that everyone believes in
something followed up by everyone has faith in something Guess what
My atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence Is
that really too much to ask


Well I don't even waste my time trying 

Well I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me Why the
supposition that you will fail to convince him amatuer psycology on Is
it because you yourself are unconvinced  

 I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it
And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest Note that
I can only speak for myself If you find faith to be honest show me how
I have been unable to reconcile it so far Maybe that's how I'm broken
I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that
you should just take my word for it If you accept that you are of a
fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you
think All I ask for is proof of the assertion God exists Logical or
physical proofs only please Then we'll discuss the nature of God

In response he tells me he will say an atheist's prayer for me 
Prayer Uh oh we'll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie 

Good luck Bob  And best regards

Good luck to you as well And again I apologize if the inferences I
made were inaccurate

        Besides I would
       rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven
       knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being
       scorched for his wrongdoings
 This display of bravado is no bluff  I've no fear any God or
      His punishment 

That was my point If I play poker with Monopoly money I can bet 
anything I want

  
 But I shan't go to heaven it would be against my sense of
      humanity and compassion for my fellow man

This is exactly why Christianity is missionary in nature
not just out of a need to irritate 
 
  
 The God of both Testaments are one and the same and in
      neither is there evidence God is strictly love  

To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written
there is evidence of love but that is a cultural bias This is
a poor answer which you needn't rebut

I will now pull the old bait and switch

I think you should use the Bible to judge man not God
By that I mean if your moral intuition doesn't like what
is described in the Bible realize that such things are going on
now I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil
and ask what are you doing to fight it Not you specifically
but everyone including myself If I don't like the genocide
in the Bible what about the genocide that goes on right now
To move beyond the question of a hell realize that many people
right now are suffering If you think hell isn't fair and are
willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence
what about how life isn't fair Right now there is a young mother
with three little kids who doesn't know how she will get through
the day Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie
Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to
fix his TV Instead of why doesn't God help them ask why don't
we help them I think you are correct to challenge any Christian
who doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess

You want evidence of God Find someone who is making a difference
someone you admire someone who has been through some tough times
and has come out with his head up Ask the person how he does it Ask 
the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind Ask the 
woman who was pregnant at  kept the baby and now is a successful
business woman Ask the doctor who has operated on a  pound
baby They won't all be Christians or even what you might
call religious but there will be something in common

God is not defined in the Bible God is defined by what is
in those people's hearts It doesn't matter if you can't give
intellectual assent to any description you've heard they're
all wrong anyway The compassion you already feel in your heart 
is a step in the right direction Follow that instead
Then come back and read the Bible and you'll see that same
thing described there

  If nothing else makes sense hang on to that idea that God is love
 
 I would say something similar but in reverse order love
      is god

Good I guess we only have to work on your grammar

I am not against capital punishment  I feel this way because God is not
only a God of love but a God of justice  As we Christians are the
instruments of His will here on earth we are expected to be true to the
mandate given us by the Lord to judge the actions of our fellow man

My favorite Scriptural reference in this regard is Romans 

       Let every person be subordinate to the higher authorities for
       there is no authority except from God and those that exist have
       been established by God   Therefore whoever resists authority
       opposes what God has appointed and those who oppose it will
       bring judgment upon themselves

My views reflect the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church

I would say only to the extent that the Roman Catholic Church
neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment as
confirmed in the recent catechism though there are many RCs
who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was
not explicitly condemned

For myself as a Catholic I see my own opposition to capital
punishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion  a
reverence for life Here in the UK the antiabortion case is
often let down by the explicit link which those on the
political left make with antiabortionists and
proexecutionists There is a tendency to condemn people who
hold both views as hypocrites I feel that if there were many
more antiabortionists who were also vocal in their opposition
to capital punishment on a prolife line it would end this
kneejerk association of antiabortion as a rightwing thing
and get many to think seriously about the issue there are
plenty who are proabortion equally for a kneejerk leftwing
reason

I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken
as support for capital punishment I take it that as a Roman
Catholic you are opposed to abortion and would still onsider
it wrong and something to be objected to even if legalised by
authority

The cited passages are covered IN DEPTH in a FAQ for this group
That particular FAQ I've forgotten the author discusses the
traditional vs prohomosexual interpretations of the passages and
indicates which points have strong textual support

Perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for
retrieving the FAQ on this topic

BTW this issue while dealt with before is VERY timely  One
of the major Presbyterian churches in California St Andrews  a 
MegaChurch in a rich neighborhood is withholding their support of 
Synod amounts to about  of the budget of the Synod which 
covers all of Southern CA and Hawaii until support for a 
prohomosexual lobbying group the Lazarus Project is terminated
This came from a news report on CNN yesterday  corrections welcome
					Tim

I think it's time for me to post the FAQ  

This is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church  On the other
side one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining
homosexual elders and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do
so  And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said
they couldn't install a homosexual pastor has made her an
evangelist  These situations as well as the one you describe do
not appear to be stable  This will certainly be a major topic for the
General Assembly next month  If the church can't come up with a
solution that will let people live with each other I think we're end
up with a split  Clearly neither side wants that but I think we'll
get pushed into it by actions of both sides

Catholic Church  The dogma of the Assumption in no way means Mary is
considered to be God or part of the Godhead  Therefore it implies no
such thing about the feminine in general

   Also Jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was
announced out of the blue  This also is incorrect as dogma is only
the formulation of what has always been part of Tradition  This dogma
has always been believed but was not formally defined until the
Assumption was declared as an ex cathedra statement

Granting that I think Christianity as a relationship with Jesus and
a love for God and one's own soul stands just fine without hell I
don't believe or see any evidence in scripture that hell is presented
as a stick with which to beat people towards heaven

I certainly agree with the last paragraph  Also Jesuss statements on
hell can be treated as totally symbolic allegorical or as parables as
was much of his other teaching  There's more than enough hell here on earth
that we are freed from by following Jesus that the rest just doesn't mattter
to me  And the fact that we can be free of the hell here is the best gift
God offers  Eternal life begins for us now and we do not wait to start
partaking of the divine nature and journeying on the path to deification

   I've read the book Some parts were quite typical regarding its

   altaltheism etc carries typical responses but not as vociferous as
   aa It does give an insight into how these historian is he one I 
   don't have any biodata on him work I've not been able to understand
   appreciate some of the arguments something like it mentions certain

Robin Lane Fox is a historian and a gardener  He has written several

  To summarize
 While questioning the sagacity of someone who said they would 
 rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven
 knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being
 scorched for his wrongdoings I described how horrible hell
 is and compared the above statement with Jesus'
 suffering on the cross in order to prevent people going to hell

which Kenneth Engel challenges
 Did this happen to Jesus I don't think so not from what I heard 
 He lived ONE DAY of suffering and died If the wages of sin is 
 the above paragraph then JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS DID HE

I will wimp out and admit that I never liked the metaphor of
Jesus paying for our sins in the sense that many Christians
accept as literal The point is that God understands the suffering
we go through not just intellectually like when we watch
the Somalians on TV but really understands He can feel 
our pain This fact is manifested by Jesus' life We can argue
that someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus
we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion we can
think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to
worse despair but the main point is that Jesus is in the
trenches with us He is in everyone whatever I do to the least
of humanity I do to Him and whatever I do for the least of
humanity I do for Him

Now to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my
capabilities but that wasn't my goal

 I'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through 

Thankfully our moderator is surprising

 but I seriously want a reasonable explanation for this

As I reread this I must admit that this is more of a description
of my faith than an explanation but perhaps that's all
I can do hopefully that's all I have to do

Can't someone describe someone's Trinity in simple declarative
sentences with words that have common meaning

When I need a kickbutt God or when I need assurance of the reality
of truth I pray to God the Father

When I need a friend someone to put his arm around me and
cry with me I pray to Jesus

When I need strength or wisdom to get through a difficult situation
I pray for the Holy Spirit

I realize that the above will probably make some people cringe
but what can I say I think the doctrine of the trinity is
an attempt to reconcile Jesus being God and being distinct from
God as described in the Bible

I wonder if Jesus had been a Hindu how different the wording would be

Now I have a question for Bob  Why in the world would any selfrespecting
atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group  I have a 
difficult enough time keeping up with it and I think I know something
about the subject     

excuse me but what makes you think that just because he's atheist he
doesn't know anything about christianity  in my albeit limited
experience atheists are often the ones who know more about the
bible having searched it from end to end for answers  i myself am a
christian but that doesn't mean i consider myself more of an
authority on my religion  i just have a different perspective on it
more biased in favor naturally  

it seems quite obvious why he is subscribed if i may infer from what
he says he is looking for an explanation  who are we to question his
motives anyway  at the very least although i dislike this kind of
logic one could hope that he will see the light  critcism will i
fear not give him a very positive picture of christians

Bob reminds me of my roommate  In order to disbelieve atheism he says 
he will need to be proven wrong about it  Well I don't even waste 
my time trying  I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it 
In response he tells me he will say an atheist's prayer for me 

with regard to this i guess i don't really feel sentiments of this
order can be proven  faith has a lot to do with it  this is why
those who search the bible from cover to cover for answers won't
necessarily get what they're looking for  of course that doesn't help
anyone who doesn't already have faith  what a big catch   i
discovered this quite recently when i ran into an agnostic looking for an
explanation of my faith and i quickly discovered that i could give him
nothing more than my life story and a description of my nature  faith
is a very personal thing  any attempt to prove the facts behind
it must be questioned

Good luck Bob  And best regards

likewise  no matter what you believe

If that's the ONLY reason I'd be inclined to doubt whether or not what

trust  Fear and trust are generally incompatible  If my only motivation

The deuterocanonical books were added much later in the church's
history  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of Scripture  I do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the Spirit in so doing  And that is where
this sort of discussion ultimately ends

The Apocryphal books that are in the Septuagint were part of the canon 
used by the Greekspeaking churches from the inception of the church
They were not added later or much later  This is a common misconception

The preference of the Hebrew canon over the Greek canon is a later
innovation   The church did not need to be guided to add the books
since they were part of the faith once received by the apostles and
passed to the Church

lots deleted with which I generally agree there is no inherently
defensible argument for the inclusion or exclusion of the Deuterocanonical
books

  I think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be 
  consistently applied are not very useful as principles 
  So if we are to exclude them not accord them the authority of
  Scripture we would appear to require other reasons What might these 
  reasons be

Lets talk about principles If we accept that God sets the
standards for what ought to be included in Scripture  then we
can ask
 Is it authoritative
 Is it prophetic
 Is it authentic
 Is it dynamic
 Is it received collected read and used

On these counts the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God
To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha
 They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
anachronisms
 They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
which are at variance with sacred Scripture
 They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture
 They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
Scripture their divine character such as prophetic power and
poetic and religious feeling

  
  My interim conclusion is that Protestant exclusion of 
  at least one of these writings is one of those 'traditions
  of men' one hears of so often They were excluded during the
  Reformation and that appears to be the reason many people
  continue to exclude them

But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that
the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place and
it wasn't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co threw
them out The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't
accept them so the reformation protestants had good historical
precedence for their actions Jerome only translated the
apocrapha under protest and it was literally 'over his dead
body' that it was included in the catholic canon

The simple fact is that Protestant exclusion Roman inclusion Orthodox
inclusion of still other books or any other definition of a closed canon
is the decision of a community of faith about what the standard collection
of scripture shall be for that community  They all are traditions of
men  Whether one considers that to be a problem or not depends on which
community happens to be yours and how you accept define authority within
it  I personally believe that the concept of a closed canon whether
Catholic Protestant or Orthodox is one that developed rather late in the
history of the church and which has not served the church well

How do you then view the words I warn everyone who  hears the
words of the prophecy of this book If anyone adds anything to
them God will add to him the plagues described in this book
And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy God will
take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city Rev 
Surely this sets the standard and not just manmade traditions

It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude He had no
argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon John
 and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus 
that in the law prophets and psalms which referred to him  the 
OT division of Scripture Luke  as well as in Luke 
taking Genesis to Chronicles the jewish order  we would say
Genesis to Malachi as Scripture

See Dr Lee MacDonald's The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon
Abingdon  for a clear and faithful examination of the origins and
issues of the canon

I am not familiar with the book

  there is nothing in Christianity that precludes the idea of
  repeated lives on earth

Doesn't it say somewhere It is appointed to man once to die
and then judgement I don't have a concordance here but I have
some dim memory that this appears somewhere in the Bible
Given a fairly specific context for what judgement is I'd say
that more or less decides the issue

Heb  clh

Indeed the immediate context NASB is

   Otherwise He would have needed to suffer often
  since the foundation of the world but now once at
  the consummation He has been manifested to put away 
  sin by the sacrifice of Himself

   And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die
  once and after this comes judgement

   so Christ also having been offered once to bear
  the sins of many shall appear a second time not to
  bear sin tro those who eagerly await him


The first point is that this verse is part of an even larger
context the subject of which is not the destiny of the
individual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ's
sacrifice once and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen 
mankind  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his 
Christianity and Reincarnation  The thrust of the passage
in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and 
sacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual 
experience of the human being after death  The once 
is repeated and emphasized and it highlights the singularity 
of Christ's deed  One thing for certain it does is to 
refute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than 
once  But the comparison to the human experience  die 
once then judgement note not the judgement but just 
judgement  The word for judgement is krisis

Hebrews  is the one passage most often quoted in defense
of the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation  At this
point I would just emphasize again that the  passages 
that arguably speak against it are few and that invariably
they are talking about something eles and the apparent denial
of reincarnation is either inferred or as in the case of
Hebrews taken literally and deposited into an implied context
namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after
death

What should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially
silent about the fate of the individual human being between death
and the Last Day  If you take the few passages that could possibly
be interpreted to mean a single earth life they are arguable  And
there are other passages that point arguably in the other direc
tion such as Matthew  and John 

We can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that
might have a bearinig on this and indeed we should discuss them
But what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach
to the idea of repeated earth lives that unlike Hindu Buddhist
and new age teachings takes full cognizance of the divinity singular
incarnation death burial resurrection and second coming of Christ
as the savior of mankind the accountability of each individual for
his deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences
the redemption of man from sin through Christ the resurrection of
the body and the Last Judgement

Taken in this larger sense many serious questions take on an entirely
different perspective  Eg the destiny of those who died in their
sins before Christ came the relationship of faith and grace to 
works the meaning of deathbed conversion the meaning of the
sacraments and many other things  Not that I propose to answer all
those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience but only that
the discussion takes on a different dimension and in my opinion
one that is truly worthy of both man the earth and their Creator and 
Redeemer There are many deep questions that continue to be deep such 
as the meaning of the second death and how the whole of Christian
doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence

There are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible 
does not speak are not things we should be concerned with  But Christ
also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know
in the future including things that his disciples and therefore others 
could not bear yet  This idea that the human capacity for growth in
knowledge not only of the individual in one lifetime but of the whole
of humanity also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth
in the spirit is a long term process  The Bible was not meant to codify
all spiritual knowledge in one place forever but to proclaim the gospel
of the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ  taking the gospel in the
greater context from Genesis to Revelation  Now salvation healing becomes 
not the end of man's sojourn but its beginning  And the Last Judgement and
the New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment

 Homosexuality is not about what goes on in the bedroom  She found that
 she was much more able to have a deep committed relationship with a woman
 than a man  Sex in her mind is only a part of the whole relationship


It sounds like she has a problem  She has a problem opening up to her
husband so she is lesbian  WHAT In a marrige a couple is supposed
to open up to each other  Because she didn't feel comfortable opening
up to her husband she gets a divorce and comes to the conclusion that
she is lesbian  Before anyone gets maried they should make sure that
they would feel comfortable open up the deepest part of her soul to

purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins it

the death penalty not for revenge but to cut down on recidivism

  Your point is well taken I acknowledge the fact that there are some who
take this position Sorry about that Of course I still believe that the
vast majority of those who favor the death penalty do so for reason of
seeking vengeance I'm curious if you favor the death penalty to keep
killers from killing again what do you think we should do with people who
commit other crimes such as rape or robbery Isn't it the Muslims who
cut your hand off if you're caught stealing

	That last paragraph just about killed me  The Deuterocanonicals have
	ALWAYS been accepted as inspired scripture by the Catholic Church
	which has existed much longer than any Protestant Church out there
	It was Martin Luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to
	REMOVE certain booksnot the fact that the Catholic Church decided
	to add some much laterthat is the reason for the difference between
	Catholic and Protestant bibles  

This is misleading at best  The question really has to do with the
status of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture  And the issue
predates the Reformation by quite a bit  Jerome was negative about the
deuteroncanonicals and in fact even though he transalted them he put
them after the Hebrew canon reordered from the Greek ordering to the
Hebrew one  His translations of them were quickanddirty also he
reports having done one of them in one day and another overnight just
dictating his translation to an amanuensis

That is to say it is the Vulgate and all of its massive importance in
Western Christianity along with the veneration of Jerome which took the
first steps in reducing these books from the status they had and have
among the Greeks

Furthermore it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers threw out these
books  Basically they just placed them in a secondary status as Jerome
had already done but with the additional warning that doctrine should
not be based on citations from these ALONE

I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound though it
seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as
part of a collection whose principles of selection in Hebrew or Greek
are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident  It also seems
to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow
more inspired  as if magical and conveying a message untranslatable
 than a translation as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in
Greek or German or English   This tendency seems to have got a
big boost in sola scriptura Protestantism even to the point of current
inerrancy bizarreness despite the more basic underlying tendency of
the Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated  If
we can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek there is
surely little reason to keep Sirach at least out of our Bibles and of
course Anglicans don't do so   For texts originally in Greek it
would seem more to be antiGreek prejudice notably by the time the
Hebrew canon is fully attested including antiChristian prejudice which
led to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint which is operative

BTW readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of
translation of the Bible including some of what I said about Jerome
above in the current numbers of the journal Bibliotheca Sacra two
of four have been published so far

I haven't read this entire thread but if someone hasn't tossed this out yet then here it is 

 Samuel  RSV  

  Then his servants said to him What is this thing that you have
  done You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive but when
  the child died you arose and ate food' He David said 'While the
  child was still alive I fasted and wept for I said 'Who knows
  whether the LORD will be gracious to me that the child may live' But
  now he is dead why should I fast Can I bring him back again I shall
  go to him but he will not return to me'

Anyhow many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven

applies to all babies or not But even if it's just this one what

Like we have never heard of or read these verses before

How about you read them in context taking into consideration the times and 
places in which they were written the local customs and pagan rituals 
what the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with 
the rest of the Bible

There are many issues in the Bible that are argued and can be argued 
successfullly from both sides of an issue  Some examples that come to mind
are 
		Gifts of the Spirit
		when the Rapture will occurpre or post tribulation
		how people should be baptized
to name a few

I have found nothing in scripture that condemns me or anyone else for having
a monogamous relationship with the person whom I love even if we are the
same sex

I'm sorry if I am coming across as heated  It's just that the Lord has been
so dear to me the last several years and I'm tired of hearing this same old
thing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for 
themselves

Check it out for yourself  Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you  If I weren't
confident of this I wouldn't invite you to do this

mcovingtaisunaiugaedu Michael Covington writes
 I heard on the radio today about a Christian student conference where
 Christians were called to repent of America's national sins such
 as sexual promiscuity
 
 To which I reply whoa there
 
 How can I repent of someone else's sin   I can't
 
 And when I claim to repent of someone else's sin am I not in fact
 judging him  Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us
 not to judge people Judge not that ye be not judged
 
 C S Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II
 when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging national repentance
 for the horrors sins of World War II
  

I see your point but I cannot more strongly disagree

To repent means to turn around  We as a nation have behaved incredibly
arrogantly toward God condoning encouraging and even forcing folks to
participate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God  We
have arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed
us the luxury of living in this land  We have set a bad example for other
nations  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions  We have
stricken the name of God from the classroom  We've cheated God out of the
honor due Him at every turn and we owe God an apology every bit as public
as our sins have been

When Jesus said Judge not that ye be not judged he was not addressing
those like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to
repent  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down
condemnation on others for their sins  His message to us all was to remove
the log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's  But
He also said to rebuke and to reprove  Don't forget that this is a command
too

Our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were
rebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the
excuse that we don't want to judge anyone

In truth what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more
and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives  Call sin
what it is and do so openly  Let it's charge fall correctly where it should
But instead of running someone into hell over it pull them out of their
hellward path and onto the heavenward path



	I deplore the horrible crime of child murder
	 We want prevention not merely punishment
	 We must reach the root of the evil
	 It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt
	 from the dreadful deed
	 No mater what the motive love of ease
		or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent
		the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed
	 but oh thrice guilty is he who drove her
		to the desperation which impelled her to the crime

If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn't the Bible
ever say so  It never comes right and says Only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised

This is not a very sound argument for baptising babies It assumes that
if the Bible doesn't say specifically that you don't need to do something
then that must mean that you do need to do it I know there's a specific
term for this form of logic but it escapes me right now However if it
were sound then you should be able to apply it this way If the Bible
doesn't specifically say that something is wrong then it must be OK
which coincidentally leads perfectly into a question I've often pondered
If slavery is immoral which I believe it is can I assume that everyone
else in this group does too why doesn't Jesus or any of the apostles
speak out against it Owning slaves was common practice back then Paul
speaks about everything else that is immoral He apparently thought it
was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard Why
doesn't anyone mention slavery If God's morals are eternal and don't
change like the morals of society then it must have been just as immoral then
as it is today

When the Protestant reformers opposed and subsequently separated from the  
Church of Rome the battle cry of the new protesting religion was The  
Bible the whole Bible and nothing but the Bible Underlying that cry  
was a theory that if people could read the Bible for themselves in their  
native tongue they would discover the truth about God and His purpose  
They would shed their old errors and be united by a common faith

   This idea that the Reformers somehow were the first to bring the
Bible to the people in their own language is a myth  Many vernacular
translations of the Bible existed long before the Reformation  The
Vulgate Bible which is still the official version of the Bible for the
Catholic Church was itself a translation in the common ie vulgar 
vulgate tongue of its day Latin and had existed for about a millenium
before the Reformation

   It might also be noted that the printing press was not even invented
until the same century as that in which the Reformation occurred

While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of
Christianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious
beliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma
to the point of misrepresentation

There are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus
Jains Buddhists and even among the various Buddhist traditions

To refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally
incorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions  Karma is considered to
be a moral process in which intentions either good or evil shape
a person's predilections for future intention and action and
produce a person who is more prone to good than evil or the opposite 
reward has nothing to do with it  Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic
so there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments  Karma is usually
described in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof  In fact As you
sow so shall you reap is found in the Pali Canon as I recall the metaphor
of natural growth is explicit

Hinduism or some sects in that tradition are I believe much more
deterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being
theistically inclined

In point of fact the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia
considers karma as only one of five influences in human life and in
fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics
of karma without the element of free will

Also in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and
rebirth which is essentially absent in Western considerations

Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
among Christian thinkers  What were his views and how did he relate them
to the Christian scriptures

in history seems to imply some pretty serious sin The one of the 
pastors in the church I attend Christchurch City Elim considers 
that a prophesy of a natural disaster as a judgement from the Lord 
is a clear sign that the prophesy is not from the Lord 

I would like to see his reasoning behind this  You may have gotten 
burned by natural disaster prophecies down there but that
does not mean that every natural disasterjudgement prophecy is
false  Take a quick look at the book of Jeremiah and it is obvious
that judgement prophecies can be valid  here in the US it seems like
we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies though I
am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement

Sometimes God does give words that are difficult to swallow  The
relative positiveness of a prophecy is not necesarily grounds to
dismiss it  Much of the OT is not happy stuff

In conversing with them on other groups I've

it does seem to be one motivation for giving up
faith  Thus some atheism might result from 
brokenness

This is condescending at best and a slightly disquised ad hominem
attack This attitude on the part of many theists especially the
vocal ones is one reason for the hostility you sense How do you
like it when atheists say that people turn to religion out of

There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which
are problematic  It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling
to me  I understand that when you pray in tongues the spirit is doing
the talking  And when you pray you pray to God  And the Spirit is
God  So the Spirit is talking to Himself  Which is why I only go
by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language

What is wrong with the Spirit talking to Himself  Jesus intercedes
for us and Romans  tell of how the Spirit intercedes for
us before God  That is no theological problem  Tounges as a prayer
language finds support in I Corinthians 


Moreover the phrase though I speak with the tongues of men and angels
used by Paul in I Cor is misleading out of context   Some would then
assume that there is some angelic tongue and if when they speak it
is no KNOWN language then it is an angelic tongue

Its true that this could be and has been used as a rug to sweep
any difficulties under  But it is a valid point  Paul does mention
angelic tounges in the verse 


Hmmmin the old testament story about the tower of Babel we see how
God PUNISHED by giving us different language  Can we assume then that
if angels have their own language at all that they have the SAME one
amongst other angels  After all THEY were not punished in any manner

If the languages we sepak are the result of Babel then it stands to
reason that angels would speak a different language from us  You do 
have a valid point about multiple angelic languages  But angelic
beings maybe of different species so to speak  maybe different species
communicate differently  

Trouble is while such stories abound any and all attempts at
verification and we are to test the spirit either show that
the witness had no real idea of the circumstances or that outright
fabrication was involved  The Brother Puka story in a previous post
seems like a friend of a friend thing  And linguistically a two
syllable word hardly qualifies as language inflection or no

I have heard an eyewitness account myself  Such things are hard to prove
They don't lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well  I don't
know if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway

Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their victories since
most ailments cured are just plain unprovable and modern day
ressurrections have never been validated so is it true that no
modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay

That's an unprovable statement  How can you prove if somethings been proved
There is no way to know that you've seen all the evidence  Once I 
saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of
his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer  

John G Lakes once prayed for someone and saw them healed in a laboratory

last time I'm taking this opportunity to post it  There is another
entry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors  They
can be retrieved from ftprutgersedu as
pubsocreligionchristianothershomosexuality  It contains far
more detail on the exegetical issues than I give here though
primarily from a conservative point of view



This posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and
Christians  This is a frequently asked question so I do not post the
question each time it occurs  Rather this is an attempt to summarize
the postings we get when we have a discussion  It summarizes
arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality since most people
asking the question already know the arguments against it  The most
common  but not the only  question dealt with herein is how can a
Christian justify being a homosexual given what the Bible says about
it

First on the definition of 'homosexual'  Many groups believe that
there is a homosexual orientation ie a sexual attraction to
members of the same sex  This is distinguished from actual homosexual
sexual activity  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by
most groups to be acceptable  However in a lot of discussion the
term 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex
This is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups  In
this paper I'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging
in sexual acts with another of the same sex  I haven't heard of any
Biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who
remains celebate

I think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be
homosexual  This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'  It is
not known whether it is genetic or environmental  There is evidence
suggesting each  The best evidence I've seen is that homosexuality is
not a single phenomenon but has a number of different causes  One of
them is probably genetic  There are several groups that try to help
people move from being homosexual to heterosexual  The bestknown is
Exodus International  The reports I've seen and I haven't read the
detailed literature just the summary in the minority opinion to the
Presbyterian Church's infamous report on human sexuality suggest that
these programs have very low success rates and that there are
questions about how real even the successes are  But there certainly
are people who say they have converted  However this issue is not as
important as it sounds  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong
believe it is intrinsically wrong defined as such by God  The fact
that it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant
than the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict  If
it's wrong it's wrong  It may affect how we deal with people though
If it's very difficult to change this may tend to make us more
willing to forgive it

One more general background issue It's common to quote a figure that
 of the population is homosexual  I asked one of our experts where
this came from  Here's his response Kinsey see below is the source
of the figure  percent  He defines sexuality by behavior not by
orientation and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero completely
heterosexual to  completely heterosexual  According to Kinsey
onethird of all male adults have had at least one experience of
orgasm homosexually post puberty  Ten percent of all adult males have
most of their experiences of homosexually  That was in   The
percentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey
Institute based on data in the early seventies but not published
until the early s or so by Bell and Weinberg I believe  I can't
put my hand on this latter reference but here is the online
information for Kinsey's own study as it appears in IRIS the catalog
at Rutgers

This figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has even
been found to hold true in several other cultures as noted in the
recent NEWSWEEK coverstory Is this child gay Feb    A
journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting
her book that allegedly refutes Kinsey's study but the scholarly
world seems to take her for a kook

I've seen some objections to the Kinsey's study but not in enough
detail to include here  If someone would like to contribute another
view I'd be willing to include it

Most Christians believe homosexuality at least genital sex is wrong
Not all however  A few denominations accept it  The Metropolitan
Community Churches is the bestknown  it was formed specifically to
accept homosexuals  However the United Church of Christ also allows
it and I think a couple of other groups may as well  The Episcopal
Church seems to accept it some areas but not others  In churches that
have congregational government you'll find a few congregations that
accept it even among Southern Baptists though the number is probably
only one or two congregations  But these are unusual  few churches
permit homosexual church leaders  How carefully they enforce this is
another issue  I don't have any doubt that there are homosexual
pastors of just about every denomination some more open than others

As to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues here's an
attempt to summarize the issues

The most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of
homosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell
Christianity Social Tolerance and Homosexuality U Chicago Press


The argument against is pretty clear  There are several explicit laws
in the OT eg Leviticus  and in Rom  Paul seems pretty negative on
homosexuality  Beyond these references there are some debates  Some
passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant  Eg
the sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was
homosexual rape not homosexual activity between consenting adults
There's even some question whether it was homosexual since the
entities involved were angels  It was particularly horrifying
because it involved guests and the responsibility towards guests in
that culture was very strong  This is probably the reason Lot
offered his daughter  it was better to give up his daughter than to
allow his guests to be attacked  If you look through a concordance
for references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible you'll see that few
seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin  There's a Jewish
interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests  At any
rate there's no debate that homosexual rape is wrong

I do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set
of laws that most Christians do not consider binding  So unless NT
justification can be found Lev alone would not settle the issue

The NT references are all in Paul's letters  A number of the
references from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly
vague  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not
mean homosexual  Here's what he says The two Greek words that appear
in the lists ie I Cor  and I Tim  are malakos and
arsenokoitai  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words
actually mean  malakos with a basic meaning of soft has a variety
of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing  Boswell suggests
wanton as a likely equivalent  He also reports that the unanimous
interpretation of the Church including Greekspeaking Christians was
that in this passage it referred to masturbation a meaning that has
vanished only in the th Cent as that practice has come to be less
frownedupon  He cites references as late as the  edition of the
Catholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation  He
translates arsenokotai as male prostitute giving evidence that none
of the church fathers understood the term as referring to
homosexuality in general  A more technical meaning suggested by the
early Latin translations would be active mode homosexual male
prostitute but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically

For a more conservative view I consulted Gordon Fee's commentary on I
Cor  He cites evidence that malakos often meant effeminate
However Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not
necessarily synonymous with homosexual though it may be associated
with some kinds of homosexual behavior  Given what Boswell and Fee
say taken together I suspect that the term is simply not very
definite and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases it
isn't a general term for homosexuality  While Fee argues against
Boswell with arsenokotai as well he ends up suggesting a
translation that seems essentially the same  The big problem with it
is that the word is almost never used  Paul's writing is the first
occurence  The fact that the word is clearly composed of male and
fk unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning since it
doesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the
action  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given
In theory it could refer to rapists etc  It's dangerous to base
meaning purely on etymology or you'll conclude that goodbye is a
religious expression because it's based on God by with ye  However
since Boswell Fee and NIV seem to agree on homosexual male
prostitute that seems as good a guess as any  Note that this
translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however something
which Fee and Boswell agree on but do not attempt to reproduce in
their translation

In my opinion the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans
  Boswell points out that Rom  speaks of homosexuality as something
that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual as a result
of their corruption due to worshipping false gods  One could argue
that this is simply an example that if a homosexual worshipped false
gods he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become
heterosexual  However I find this argument somewhat forced and in
fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is
what Paul meant

However I am not convinced that Rom  is sufficient to create a law
against homosexuality for Christians  What Paul is describing in Rom
 is not homosexuality among Christians  it's homosexuality that
appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness
Despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric I'm sure Paul
does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex
Given his description of their situation I rather assume that their
heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless  So yes I do
believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality
But in all fairness the shameless nature of their acts is a
reflection of the general spiritual state of the people and not a
specific feature of homosexuality

My overall view of the situation is the following I think we have
enough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of
homosexuality  Rom  seems clear  While I Cor  and I Tim  are
not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality they do
not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of
homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases  On the
other hand none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the
subject  Rom  is really about idolatry  It refers to homosexuality
in passing

The result of this situation is that people interpret these passages
in light of their general approach to Scripture  For those who look
to Scripture for laws about issues such as this it not surprising
that they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT
prohibition  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal
it is not surprising that they regard Paul's negative view of
homosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing
without any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel  As
readers of this group know by now the assumptions behind these
approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the
mouth when they see the opposing view described  There's not a lot I
can do as moderator about such a situation

A number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of
detailed exegesis of texts that is described above  However in fact
I'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their
own beliefs on such analyses  The real issue seems to rest on the
question of whether Paul's judgement should apply to modern
homosexuality

One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds
of questions we are trying to deal with  He encountered homosexuality
only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was
wrong  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act
straight and fail and he had never faced Christians who are trying
to define a Christian homosexuality which fits with general Christian
ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the
relationship between God and man  It is unfair to take Paul's
judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make
judgements on these questions

Another is the following In Paul's time homosexuality was associated
with a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable  It
was part of temple prostitution  Among private citizens it often
occured between adults and children or free people and slaves  I'm
not in a position to say that it always did but there are some
reasons to think so  The ancients distinguished between the active
and passive partner  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult
to act as the passive partner  This is the reason that an active
mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful  His
customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role  This
supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two
free adult males at least not without some degree of scandal
Clearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children
slaves or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible
partners  However Fee's commentary on I Cor cites some examples from
ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve
free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way  Thus the considerations
in this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far  Homosexuality may have
been discredited for Jews by some of these associations but there
surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not
involve slaves or children

Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against
homosexuality  I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by
promiscuous sex both homosexual and heterosexual  Someone who has a
homosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is
not at risk for AIDS

Note that there is good reason from Paul's general approach to doubt
that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative
apart from any specific statements on homosexuality  I believe his
use of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual
marriage as what God ordained

However the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning
against being too quick to deal with this issue legally

I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is
not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one  Paul's
tendency as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating
holidays is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues
to look very carefully at the good of the people involved and to
avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging
For example while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat
meat he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about
which they had personal qualms  For another example Paul obviously
would have preferred to see people at least in some circumstances
remain unmarried  Yet if they were unable to do so he certainly
would rather see them married than in a state where they might be
tempted to fornication

I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the
views Paul expressed in Rom   One may believe that homosexuality is
not what God intended that it occured as a result of sin but still
conclude that at times we have to live with it  Note that in the
creation story work enters human life as a result of sin  This
doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved  The
question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful
or whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sense
due to human sinfulness  If you're willing to consider the latter
approach then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more
damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it
The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often
fails and when it does you end up with damage ranging from
psychological damage to suicide as well as broken marriages when
attempts at living as a heterosexual fail

This is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent nature
of homosexuality  If you believe it is a very serious wrong then you
may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it
Clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency
to steal or with drug addiction even though attempts to cure these
conditions are also very difficult  However these conditions are
intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for
homosexuality  Many problems associated with homosexuality are
actually problems of promiscuity not homosexuality  This includes
AIDS  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual
relationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent
to Christian heterosexual relationships

In the course of discussing this over the last decade or so we've
heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in
this situation  I've also seen summaries of various research and the
results of various efforts for conversion  Aside from the
Presbyterian report mentioned above there's an FAQ that summarizes
our readers' reports on this question  The evidence is that
longterm success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a
par with healing miracles  The danger in advising Christians to
depend upon such a change is clear When conversion doesn't happen
which is almost always the people are often left in despair feeling
excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement
of lifelong celibacy  Paul recognized though in a different
context that such a demand is not practical for most people and I
think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that
judgement  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay
sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality  Maybe
homosexuality isn't God's original ideal but I can well imagine Paul
preferring to see people in longterm committed Christian
relationships than promiscuity  As with work  which Genesis
suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either  I think such
relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love
with each other

There's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this
discussion  The issue is that of cultural relativism  That is
when Paul says that something is wrong should this be taken as an
eternal statement or are things wrong because of specific situations
in the culture of the time  Conservative Christians generally insist
on taking prohibitions as absolute since otherwise the Bible becomes
subjective  what is to stop us from considering everything in it as
relative

When looking at this issue it's worth noting that no one completely
rejects the concept of cultural relativism  There are a number of
judgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians
consider to be relative  The following judgements are at least as
clear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality

   prohibition against charging interest this occurs  times in
	the OT  it's not in the NT but I mention it here because
	until relatively recently the Church did consider it binding
	on Christians
   prohibition against swearing oaths
   endorsement of slavery as an institution
   judgement of tax collectors as sinner

We do not regard these items as binding  In most cases I believe the
argument is essentially one of cultural relativism  Briefly

   prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific
	agrarian society that the Bible was trying to build
	but not to our market economy
   few people believe that American judicial oaths have the
	same characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was
	concerned about
   most people believe that Paul was simply telling people
	how to live within slavery but not endorsing it as
	an institution
   for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to
	Roman tax farming

The point I'm trying to make is that before applying Biblical
prohibitions to the th Cent we need to look at whether the th
Cent actions are the same  When Christian homosexuals say that their
relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul
would have been familiar with this is exactly the same kind of
argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors
Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest and
many Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed  Indeed
slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship
between God and human beings  Christians are often called servants
or slaves of God

I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally
relative  Rather I'm trying to say that some things are and
therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in
the Bible that ends the discussion  We need to look at whether the
action we're talking about now has the same moral implications as the
one that the Bible was talking about  If Christians want to argue
that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against
homosexuality are still binding I'm willing to listen  Those who
claim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kidding
themselves unless they are part of the small minority who really obey
all the rules listed above

One thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue
creates  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence 
some laws in Leviticus a passage in Rom whose subject matter is
really idolatry rather than homosexuality and a couple of lists whose
words are ambiguous  the amount of concern this is raising among
Christians seems rather out of proportion  This should suggest to
people that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved
This is true on both sides  clearly homosexual Christians are as
strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments
as conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments  But I
can't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way
of justifying attitudes which come from other sources  This is a
dangerous situation for Christians

On the other side of the issue I would like to note some problems I
have with the prohomosexual position as it is commonly presented
One of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically
determined  Ie God made me homosexual and I have no choice  I
think God made me homosexual is a fine view for people who already
believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable  But I
don't see it as an argument for acceptability

Many people think that alcholism is largely biological and drug
addiction may turn out to be as well  That doesn't mean it's OK
Most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong  Some people
get angry easily  Others tend to be arrogant  Others tend to be
attraced to women who are married to someone else  Homosexuality if
we view it as wrong wouldn't be different than any of these other
things  If we are going to follow God we all end up at one time or
another having to work to overcome bad habits and particular
temptations that cause us problems  None of us can sit back and say
that because God made us the way we are we can just relax  As Jesus
said we all have to take up our cross daily  This concept of dying
to self which also appears throughout Paul's letters seems to
suggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we
are called on not to accept  Paul's letters and the experience of
Christians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us and
the battle against it is lifelong and difficult  The fact that
homosexuality is difficult to fight doesn't necessarily say it's OK
Maybe this isn't the place where we have to die to self  But I'd like
to make sure that those who think it isn't are fighting the battle
somewhere else and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have
to fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin

It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support
the doctrine of Original Sin  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine with no
other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism  Even among its
supporters however people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants
will go to hell

It's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of
scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine  However if we have the
heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically
based then we can come to an understanding of the truth  Let's now take a
more complete look at scripture

Colossians  In him you were also circumcised in the putting off of
the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by Christ having been
buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the
power of God who raised him from the dead

In baptism we are raised to a new life in Christ Romans  through a
personal faith in the power of God  Our parent's faith cannot do this  Do
infants have faith  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it

Romans  But not all the Israelites accepted the good news  For
Isaiah says 'Lord who has believed our message'  Consequently faith
comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word
of Christ

So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
gospel  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached  Kids
are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to
respond to God's word  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
be raised in baptism to a new life

Ezekiel  The soul who sins will die  The son will not share the
guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son  The
righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the
wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him

If you read all of Ezekiel  you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty
for anyone else's sins  So we can have no original guilt from Adam

Ezekiel  Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted
and get a new heart and a new spirit  Why will you die O house of Israel
For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the Sovereign Lord
Repent and live

The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit  Kids
cannot do this  Acts  says that when we repent and are baptized we
will then receive a new spirit the Holy Spirit  Then we shall live

Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is
not Biblical let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it

Romans  Therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and
death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all
sinned

Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned  Death came to
each man because each man sinned  Note that it's good to read through all
of Romans   Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than
others but if we read them in context we will see that they are all
saying basically the same thing  Let's look at one such

Romans  For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many
were made sinners so also through the obedience of the one man the many
will be made righteous

Through the disobedience of each individual each was made a sinner  In
the same way through the obedience of Jesus each will be made righteous
We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each
man only because each man sinned not because of guilt from Adam
Otherwise the Bible would contradict itself  I encourage you to read
through this whole passage on your own looking at it from this point of
view to see if it doesn't all fit together

Psalm  Surely I was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother
conceived me

This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves
before God in repentance for sinning  David himself was a man after God's
own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and
murdering her husband  All that David is saying here is that he can't
remember a time when he wasn't sinful  He is humbling himself before God
by confessing his sinfulness  His saying that he was sinful at birth is
a hyperbole  The Bible being inspired by God isn't limited to a literal
interpetation but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus John 
For another example of hyperbole see Luke 

Now then even though people see that baptism requires faith and that
original sin is not Biblical they will still argue that infant baptism is
necessary because children sin by being selfish  not sharing toys with
other children by being mean  hitting others and fighting etc

Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things but my gut feeling
is always that they don't know any better  Let's look to see if the Bible
agrees with my gut feelings

Isaiah  Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign  The
virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him
Immanuel  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the
wrong and choose the right

Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy
about Jesus  If they don't then point them to Matthew  and find a new
leader  Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human
babies  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent
before he would know the difference between right and wrong  We see that
he did grow and become wiser in Luke  and   The implication is
that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over
wrong  Since we know that Jesus was perfect  without sin we have rather
conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose
the right instead of the wrong

Jesus himself was baptized albeit with John's baptism not as an infant
but as a thirtyyearold man Luke  and started his ministry as
soon as he was baptized Luke   Immediately afterwards he was
tempted by the devil Luke  Matthew  Mark

I think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of
your response  First original sin is not a Catholiconly doctrine
It was held by Luther and Calvin as well and is still present in one
form or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions  Second
saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is
an ad hominem argument which has considerable evidence against it
The original Baptist theology included original sin and some Baptists
still hold it  And there are certainly groups that baptize infants
without believing in original sin  Among Protestants the sacraments
tend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics  Protestants who
baptize infants see baptism as a sign of God's acceptance of us
rather than our acceptance of God  In traditional Protestant
theology God's grace precedes our response and is applicable to
children  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate
that God accepts even children  clh

 Imagine the worst depth of despair you've
 ever encountered or the worst physical pain you've ever experienced
 Some people suffer such emotional physical and mental anguish
 in their lives that their deaths seem to be merciful But at least
 the pain does end in death What if you lived a hundred such lives
 at the conclusion of one you were instantly reborn into another
 What if you lived a million a billion years in this state
 What if this kept going forever


Did this happen to Jesus I don't think so not from what I heard He lived
ONE DAY of suffering and died If the wages of sin is the above paragraph then
JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS DID HE

This is something I've always found a little curious I've never quite understood
the trinity thing On the one hand Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate But
at the same time he is God's son For God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten son First question is if Jesus was God in human form how could
he really be God's son If the Holy Ghost planted the seed in Mary so to speak
then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the
human fatherson relationship While a son might inherit alot of the father's 
qualities he is not the father They are still two separite entities To try
and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong In that
case Jesus and God aren't the same On the other hand if their relationship
isn't the same as the human fatherson relationship but Jesus is actually God
incarnate then he's not really God's son and he never was He's just God
manifesting himself as Jesus At least this is how I'm seeing it Can someone
who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us 

Getting back to the original question what is the great price that Jesus paid
to redeem our sins Was it dying on the cross Since Jesus knew that he would
rise again in  days and then ascend back to heaven I have a hard time seeing
how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity His earthly body
may have been killed but then so what He suffered a few hours of physical
pain but then there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more
The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much
meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to Jesus being the only
one was simply a matter of choice I suspect that these questions will be very
offensive to many Christians on this net To those people please accept my
sincere apologies It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ
But I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious
 
Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together
First your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one  In this
group it's dangerous to say that no one believes something  You
seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense
with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother  I consider that
terrible heresy though some people react less violently  The Virgin
Birth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility  But it doesn't
imply that God's sperm was involved  Indeed one though by no means
the only speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material

Second Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father  In a
Trinitarian context the term Son refers to the eternal Logos who is
a part of God  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth
Jesus is the incarnation of the Son  So his sonness isn't
specifically a result of being incarnated  Rather it's the Son
who was incarnated

There is a paragraph in the New Testament which in my opinion clearly makes
a positive inference to reincarnation I don't remember which one it is off of
the top of my head but it basically goes like this Jesus is talking with the
apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can 
come Elijah must first come Jesus replies that Elijah has come but they did 
not recognize him It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering 
to John the Baptist This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation

This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus time that Elijah
would return again as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and
did not actually die  However Jesus was referring to John the
Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John
remember Elijah didnt die but that John was a similar prophet to
Elijah  John was a fiery preacher he wore sackcloth and wandered
rough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom  The verses that
describe him in Marks gospel can be linked to OT references about
Elijah  Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing the
parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the Suffering
Servant in Isaiah and other messianic figures and himself

A brief reply but I dont have time to look up all the relevant stuff

Suffice to say there is a very strong explanation

Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of
the Acts of the Apostles can be found

 An english translation of this can be found in
   The Acts of the Apostles translated from the Codex Bezae with an
   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance J M Wilson
   London 

 Another work that might be useful is
   The Acts of the Apostles a Critical Edition with Introduction and
   Notes on Selected Passages Albert C Clark Oxford 
   reprinted 

This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the
text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic  I don't know if it
actually contains an english translation or not

 Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is
   The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in
   Acts Eldon J Epp Cambridge 

 The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the
early 's  I can supply the reference if anyone's interested

 Now many of the works are going to be difficult to find  So if
you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension
an excellent and easily obtainable discussion can be found in
   A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT Bruce Metzger United Bible
   Society 

Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS rd edition of
the Greek NT  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went
behind the decisions on each of the  variant readings included in
the UBS  Furthermore notes on an addition  readings are
included in aTCotGNT the majority of these occur in Acts

In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes
   An attempt was made to set before the reader a more or less full
   report with an English translation of the several additions and
   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses 
   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the
   textvolume care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the
   evidence that supports the divergent readings p 

I understand that one of the early codexes Vaticanus and Siniaticus has
this version of Acts  It would be interesting to know what the
differences are between the long and the short forms

 Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have including the
ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus adher pretty closely to the shorter
or Alexandrian version  The longer version to which you refer is
usually called the Western version and its main witness is the Codex
Bezae althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources

 As far as size the difference is that in Clark's edition
mentioned above the book of Acts contains  words whereas the
text edited by Westcott and Hort a typical Alexandrian text contains
 words ie a difference of about 

 To answer the obvious questions no there are no major revelations
in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text  The main
difference seems to expansion of detail in the Western text or if
you prefer contractions in the Alexandrian  The Western text seems
to be given to more detail  There are some interesting specific
cases but this probably not the place to go into it in detail

 The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the
more authentic has been hot and heavy  If there is anything
approaching a modern consensus it is i that neither text represents
purely the authentic version ii each variant reading has to be
examined on its own merits however iii the variant in the
Alexandrian text is the better more often than not

Heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity innocence
and modesty and their importance



    The Most Beautiful Virtues

    This story is an excerpt taken from The  Basket  of  Flowers   by
    Johann Christoph von Schmid


    In a certain little market town over a hundred years ago	there
    lived  an  upright	and  intelligent man named Jacob Rede He was
    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in
    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large beautiful val
    ley After living many happy years together Jacob's wife	died
    leaving  him alone with only one friendhis daughter Mary Even
    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty but as she grew in  years
    her piety her innocence her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss
    towards all she came in contact with gave to her beauty  a  rare
    and  peculiar  charm Her face was lighted up with a look of such
    indescribable goodness that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one
    looked upon an angel

    Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour
    ite  flowers  were the violet the lily and the rose Jacob loved
    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her
    gender  When	she  once early in March brought the first violet to
    him and joyfully called upon him to admire it he said

    Let the modest violet my dear Mary be to you an image of humil
    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret It clothes
    itself in the tender colours of modesty it prefers to  bloom  in
    retired  grots it fills the air with its fragrance while remain
    ing hidden beneath the leaves  May you also my  dear  Mary  be
    like  the  retiring violet avoiding vain display not seeking to
    attract the public	eye  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in
    quietude and peace

    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the
    garden appeared in its richest array Jacob said to his daughter
    as he pointed out a beautiful lily  which	was  beaming  in  the
    morning sun

    Let the lily my dear child be to you the emblem
     of purity Look how beautiful how pure and fair it is The whi
    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals
    they are like the snow Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure
    and as free from stain But the purest of all colours is also the
    hardest

				   







    to preserve pure Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled	touch
    it	but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind  In the
    same way a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence
    Then pointing to a rose he said

     Let the rose my dear Mary be to you an emblem of modesty  More
    beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to
    the cheek of a modest girl It is a sign that she is  still  pure
    of	heart  and  innocent in thought Happy is the maiden whom the
    suggestion of a thought that is indelicate will cause to  blush
    as	she  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger
    The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with
    their  roseate  hue while those which fail to blush at the least
    indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and	wan  and  go
    before their time to the grave




    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one
    that  was  prized above all the others It was an apple tree not
    much larger than a rose bush and stood by itself in  the  middle
    of	the garden Mary's father had planted it the day that she was
    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples Once it
    blossomed  earlier	than  usual  and with unusual luxuriance The
    tree was one mass of blossom Mary was so delighted with it  that
    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at
     it Once when it was in full bloom she called  to  her  father
    and said

    Look father how beautiful Was there ever such a lovely mingling
    of	red  and  white  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of
    flowers

    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes
    once  more	upon the tree But what was her grief to see that the
    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers They were  all
    become  brown  and	yellow	and  when  the	sun came forth in its
    strength they withered and fell to the ground Mary  wept  bitter
    tears at the sight Then said the father

    Thus does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth  Oh  my
    child  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced
    from the path of right Behold in the example of the  apple  tree
    an	image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way
     if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has	raised	in  my	heart
    should  vanish  not  merely for a day or year but for life Ah
    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed
    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your
    cheeks Life would have no joys for me with tears in my eyes  I
    should

				   







    go down sorrowfully to my grave

    As he spoke the tears stood in his eyes Mary was deeply  moved
    and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her
    mind that she never forgot them

    Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and	wise  and  amid  the
    flowers  of  her  garden Mary grew daily in stature and intelli
    gence  blooming as a rose pure as a  lily  and  retiring	as  a
    violet and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom

    Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the
    fruits  of	his  garden  rewarded his diligent toil but with how
    much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect
    produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his
    pious teaching and example

    Jacob plucked several roses and lilies tied them together	in  a
    bunch and gave them to Mary with the words

    The lily and the rose sister flowers as they are belong the one
    to	the  other  both incomparable in their beauty they are ren
    dered still more lovely by being together In  the	same  way  my
    dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and
    cannot be separated




    The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought
    of the presence of God

Hate the sin but love the sinnerI've heard that quite a bit recently 
often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality
but the context really isn't that important My question is whether that
statement is consistent with Christianity I would think not

Hate begets more hate never love Consider some sin I'll leave it unnamed
since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not 
something is a sin Now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see
what happens If we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the 
stronger our hatred of it will become Eventually this hate becomes so 
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner In addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and 
do things which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even 
believe what they are doing is a sin After enough of this the sinner begins
to hate us they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their
behavior Hate builds up and drives people away from Godthis certainly
cannot be a good way to build love

In the summary of the law Christ commands us to love God and to love our 
neighbors He doesn't say anything about hate In fact if anything he 
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves So how are Christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others I suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin either in others or ourselvesthrough prayer We
need to ask God to help us with our own sin and to help those we love 
with theirs Only love can conquer sinhatred has no place The best way to
love someone is to pray for them

erhteslanjitedu writes

    Could anyone enlighten me on how the Mormon church views 
children born out of wedlock  In particular I'm interested to know if any 
stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents  

All children are born pure ie without sin
However most saints would view a pregnancy
outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning
Some church members would be much more
judgmental but that is their problem

In situations where welfare assistance is 
provided through our Church bishops usually
require that the family be making some effort to
live the Gospel standards and provide for 
themselves

However there are occasions when assistance is
provided because of the children in the home
As a former bishop of mine said Children are 
always worthy before God

I'm especially 
keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on 
bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical 
book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City  

I am not sure what you mean by the term bastards
in this context

LatterDay Saints believe that through the
temple ordinances the family unit may be
preserved in eternity

If you use genealogical material or software
produced by the Church you may notice a section
for temple ordinances  Within that section
there should be a spot for signifying BIC
which stands for born in the covenant

The children born to couple sealed married
within the temple are born in the covenant
and are eligible to be part of that eternal
family unit
Children born to other couples whether in a
civil marriage or not would have to be
sealed to their parents after their marriage
is solemnized for eternity

Supposing a child were born to a woman out of
wedlock he or she could be sealed to his or
her parents at a later date or adopted into 
any eternal family unit which may include one
of the birth parents

If this is an issue on which the 
official position has changed over time I'm interested in learning both old 
and new beliefs  Email or posting is fine  All information or pointers are 
appreciated

I can't say if this principle of adoption
was revealed at the same time as the sealing 
ordinances but it has been accepted for the 
 years I have been in the Church

I would tend to discount any admonitions from
the Church authorities against having children
out of wedlock because even though there are
provisions within the Lord's plan to recover
what we have done wrong the Church does not
want to give anyone the impression we can sin
and repent at our leisure

Homosexual Christians have indeed checked out these verses  Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations
Others simply do not address the issues

You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spiritled course
in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know  I suggest that
you stop prooftexting about things you know nothing about

Let me say that the life death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is
central to Christianity If you personally believe that Jesus Christ
died for you you are a part of the Christian body of believers

We are all still human We don't know it all but homosexual or heterosexual
we all strive to follow Jesus  The world is dying and needs to hear about
Jesus Christ

Are you working together with other Christians to spread the Gospel

Thanks for the responses so far I hope that I have 
sparked some thought which is more my intent than 
to restart one of the Reformations

I'm just going to tug on two threads

In MessageID Mayathosrutgersedu
dbnandrewcmuedu D Andrew Byler writes 

	And I must point out that
the Jews only drew up their canon in  AD  years after the founding
of the Christian Religion upon the Cross  Why should we adhere to a
canon that was drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the Chrsitian
use of the Greek Septuagint which includes the deuterocanon  

I was simply observing that as a nonJew I am not in that community
which might be bound by such a decision I don't know much about
the Council of Jamnia but I have heard that it is not wellattested
historically 'Faithless' has nothing to do with it and I prefer
not to speculate about motives

As early
as  AD St Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the
Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain books  

I wish the DialoguewithTrypho were a real transcript of a real
dialogue but I think it a fictional effect on Justin's part
Putting that to one side Justin's point may be evidential one
would want to know 'which books'

Protestants apparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited 
by a decree of the Jews 

Perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light MS evidence
they had Let's stick to the issues Again I prefer not to speculate
about motives One would need quotes from Luther Calvin etc to
evidence this 'preference'

That is not quite accurate  Otherwise we would have the book
of Enoch in the canon as Dave noted  One can say that the 
apocrypha are not quoted by Christ  

Is this the principle 'Any BC text not quoted by Christ cannot
be counted as Scripture'  Think well about this Job Ruth

I wrote
 		These is a logically invalid a priori 
 		Besides we are talking about OT texts 
 		which in many parts are superceded by the NT
 		in the Xtian view Would not this same
 		principle exclude Ecclesiastes
 		This principle cannot be consistently applied

Dave W answers
 
I have to reject your argument here  The Spirit speaks with one
voice and he does not contradict himself  

Meaning what Do you affirm the principle that the Dc's can be
excluded since they contain 'false doctrine' or do you deny it 
If affirmed as is implied in your statement how does one determine 
that doctrine X is false Do you affirm every teaching in Ecclesiastes

The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired
by the Spirit ie Godbreathed  It is a test which is more
guided by faith than by reason or logic  

If so it may be a test that cannot be applied The Orthodox
faithfully believe that Psalm  is canonical How can my
faith say 'Not'  All I hear here is the a priori I mentioned
before

The deuterocanonical books were added much later in the church's
history  

This is contrary to fact

They do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of Scripture  

Can this be elevated to a principle How is 'spiritual quality'
measured I'll take the 'spiritual quality' of most of Sirach over 
Joshua or Chronicles any day

I do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the Spirit in so doing  

What can I say You believe what you believe I'm asking for
a consistency check I don't see that the books were added in any
construction this formulation begs the question No one can validly
ask me to 'have faith' that these books are noncanonical

These are my opinions  activities alone

QOTD

Christianity is not a doctrine not I mean a theory about what has
 happened and will happen to the human soul but a description of something
 that actually takes place in a human life  For consciousness of sin' is a
 real event and so are despair and salvation through faith  Those who speak
 of such things Bunyan for instance are simply describing what has happened
 to them whatever anyone may want to say about it  Ludwig Wittgenstein

            It's my understanding that the US Supreme Court has never

        cases involving religion that have come before the Court 
            Can anyone verify or falsify this  
            Has any state or other government tried to give a legal 
        definition of religion 

According to the legal practices of today's America I imagine the legal
definition of religion if defined may resemble the following

	Any system of belief or practice to which people are committed
	for the benefit of society which must in the opinion of secular
	thought be isolated from political and educational influence

	Should any system of belief or practice to which people are
	committed be harmful or void of any benefit to society in the
	opinion of religious thought as defined in the previous paragraph
	isolation of such from political and educational influence would
	constitute unreasonable censorship and an unlawful violation of
	civil rights

Someday perhaps they'll legalize benevolence

to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality

Homosexual Christians have indeed checked out these verses  Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations
Others simply do not address the issues

You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spiritled course
in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know  I suggest that
you stop prooftexting about things you know nothing about
 
Michael

Well Michael  I don't know if clh has left them in the faq  Maybe you should
post the how to get there map again but I posted two or three lengthy
exegetical paper on these verses  They looked at the OT NT and
intertestimental usages of terms in reference  I would suggest you read those
before you talk about a need in exegetical studies  If those aren't enough
I could also provide The source and NT Meaning of Apsevokoitai  Dr James
DeYoung published it in THE MASTERS SEMINARY JOURNAL in fall of '  To read
any of these  papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need
for honest exegesis

Again please refer to the faq file or if you are unable to acess it drop me

speaking of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin

It was a gift from God  I think basically the reasoning was that the
tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus

Yes  For examples of this in the writings of the early fathers consider

    You alone and your Mother
        are more beautiful than any others
    For there is no blemish in you
        nor any stains upon your Mother
    Who of my children
        can compare in beauty to these
                 St Ephrem the Syrian Nisibene Hymns  around
                   AD 

    Lift me up not from Sara but from Mary a Virgin not only undefiled 
    but a Virgin whom grace has made inviolate free of every stain of sin
                 St Ambrose Commentary on Psalm   ca AD 

There are many others

As the tenets of faith developed particularly with Augustine sin was
more and more equated with sex and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin
for life since she never sinned and since she was the spouse of God etc

No  We have for instance

    Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of
    Holy Mary and being questioned did not immediately add the Virgin
     And to Holy Mary Virgin is invariably added for that Holy Woman
    remains undefiled
                 St Epiphanus of Salamis Panacea against all heresies
                   between AD 

    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine
    about children of Mary  For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen
    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent
    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord home of the Eternal
    King with the seed of human intercourse  Anyone who proposes this is
    merely proposing  that Christ could not be born of a virgin
                 Pope St Siricius Letter to Anysius Bishop of 
                   Thessalonica AD 

Note that St Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in AD   I
don't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was but I'm quite
sure it was after   The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originated
long before Augustine's time  We hold that it originated with the 
Apostles

Strictly speaking however Mary's perpetual virginity is independent
of her Immaculate Conception  Mary could have been Immaculately 
Conceived and not remained a virgin she could have remained a virgin
and not been Immaculately Conceived

Since we also had this notion of original sin ie that man is born with
a predisposition to sin and since Mary did not have this predisposition
because she did not ever sin she didn't have original sin  When science
discovered the process of conception the next step was to assume that
Mary was conceived without original sin the Immaculate Conception

No  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original
sin was transmitted at conception when a person's life begins
Biology had nothing to do with it  Prayerfully reflecting on the
truth of Mary's sinlessness and the means by which God could have
achieved this the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate
Conception  Thus the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine
but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones

The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was
given by Pope Sixtus IV  and the Feast was made a precept
feast of the Church by Pope Clement XI 

Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes  She 
refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception  Since a nine year old 
would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed
to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine

No  First of all Lourdes is private revelation and doctrine is not
based on private revelation  The most that private revelation can do
is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation
which ended with the death of St John the Apostle

Second the case for the doctrine was irreformably sealed in  
with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull Ineffabilis Deus by
Pope Pius IX  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as
a dogma a dogma by definition cannot change and is required to be
believed by the faithful

The apparition at Lourdes happened in  four years later  The most
that might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation
of  a sort of heavenly stamp of approval but the Church has never
claimed that nor shall she

In Christ's Peace

Do we attach some meaning of the Israelites entering the promised land to 
Christianity

   I submit God did not hold the children responsible when the adults chose 
to follow the bad report of the  spies over Joshua and Caleb  This is 
recorded for us in Deuteronomy  Moreover your little ones which ye said 
should be a prey and your children which in that day had no knowledge 
between good and evil they shall go in thither and unto them will I give 
it and they shall possess it

   At least to me it seems there wasis an age or point in maturity where 
they wereare held responsible and could not enter the Promised Land 
younger ones were not held to the same rules at least not by God

I have enrolled in The History of Christianity at a college here in
St Louis The teacher of the class is what I consider to be
closedminded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of
Christianity is  His definition is tied directly to that of the
Trinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in
Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian

While his saying it doesn't make it so  I nevertheless feel insulted
or am I just neurotic   I would like to be able to respond to
him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable
studentteacher relationship

So is there common definition of what Christianity is  As the
previous discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange
of flames I am hopeful that this will also not produce major
flames

Regards

Often we get into discussions about who is Christian  Unfortunately
there are a number of possible definitions  Starting from the 
broadest commonly used definitions are

  a historical definition
  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior
  a broad doctrinal definition
  narrow doctrinal definitions

 By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular
historian would likely use  This would include any group that
developed out of the Christian church and continues within the same
broad culture  Eg some Unitarians would fail just about any
doctrinal test you could come up with  Yet it's clear that that group
developed from Christianity and people from very different
backgrounds eg Hindus would likely see them as part of
Christianity  This is not a definition most Christians like but it's
relevant in some political and ethnic contexts

 Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many
Christian groups for membership eg the Southern Baptists and
Presbyterian Church USA  I would qualify it by saying that what
most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ so that
someone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit  It's
an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based
on technical doctrine  By this definition groups such as Arians
would be viewed as heretical Christians but still Christians  In the
modern context this would include Mormons JW's and oneness
Pentecostals  They would be viewed as heretical Christians but
still Christian  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls
into this category would accept the Apostle's Creed

 The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition
which includes all of the major strands of Christianity but excludes
groups that are felt to be outside historic Christianity  This is
of course a slippery enterprise since Catholics could argue that
Protestants are outside historic Christianity etc  But I think the
most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the
Nicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon  The attempt is to
characterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree
are key  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement  A
Mormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand and thus will not
want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs  But I think
this definition would have fairly broad acceptance

 Finally some people use definitions that I would say are limited
to a specific Christian tradition  Eg some evangelicals only
consider someone Christian if he has had an evangelicalstyle
conversion experience and some I've even heard of groups that limit
it to their specific church

I think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used
A lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for  If
you're using it descriptively eg in history or anthropology you'll
probably use definition  or   If you're using it normatively ie
to say what you believe the Christian message is you'll probably use
a definition like  or even

 In the NT the clear references are all from Paul's letters  In Rom
  there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil
 Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality  it's about
 idolatry  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment or at
 least result of idolatry  There are a number of arguments over this
 passage  It does not use the word homosexuality and it is referring
 to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality
 So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality

That's like saying that murder is only wrong for those of us who aren't natural
murders and stealing is only wrong for those of us who aren't natural
thieves

In response to alleged circular reasoning concerning the morality of      
homosexuality clh poses the following challenge

In order to break the circle there's got to be some other
reason to think homosexuality is wrong

I answer

The circle is simple to break   The Church teaches that homosexual
behavior is immoral  This teaching is raw impassionate unassailable
dogma  That closes the argument for me

This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults since
both have souls  Infants must be baptized therefore or they cannot
enter into Heaven  They too need this form of life in them or they
cannot enter into Heaven

Are you saying that baptism has nothing to do with asking Jesus to come into
your heart and accepting him as your savior but is just a ritual that we
must go through to enable us to enter Heaven


	My feeling on baptism is this  parents baptize their baby so that the
	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism and thus removal of original
	sin on its soul in the event of an unexpected death
	
	That is the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young
	to speak on its own  This should not surprise anyone  don't parents
	always do what they believe is the best for their baby  Why would
	that apply to the baby's physical needs only but not hisher spiritual
	needs to have God's grace
	
	The purpose of confirmation is for the baby now young adult to 
	decide to reaffirm for himselfherself the promises that hisher
	parents made at baptism  That is where accepting Jesus into your
	heart comes in  In baptism the parents ask Jesus to come into their
	baby's heart at confirmation the child repeats that request 
	independently
	
	By the way these are my personal feelings though I believe they are
	pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the Catholic Church on
	this issue  Can anyone out there back me up or correct me

mpaulunledu marxhausen paul writes

I hate to sound flippant having shot off my mouth badly on the net
before but I'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my
feeling that the assumption of Mary would be better phrased our
assumptions about Mary  In all the time I've been reading about
Mary on this group I can not recall reading much about Mary that
did not sound like wishful veneration with scant if any Scriptural
foundation  

I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ's parents
as compellingly human persons to be honored and admired for their
humility and submission to God's working beyond doubt  But the almalga
mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me
an image of alien and inhuman creatures untouched by sin or human
desire  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified and even He knew
temptation albeit without submitting to it

I also don't see the necessity of saying the Holy Parents were some
how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or
dinary human being  

I won't start yelling about how people are worshipping Mary etc
since folks have told me otherwise about that but I do think we
lose part of the wonder of God's Incarnation in Christ when we make
his parents out to be sinless sexless deathless otherworldly beings

	You did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to 
offend us Catholics hopefully I can be just as careful in my wording as you
were
	I also don't want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of
debate anymore than it already is but just a note or two

	  Please don't talk about Jesus' parentsthe doctrinal positions
		of the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary and
		Joseph  I personally have never heard of anything being
		attributed to St Joseph other than his sainthood that is
		no reference ever to him being sinless assumed into heaven
		immaculately conceived etcall these ideas apply only to
		Mary

	  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our
		doctrines about Mary  Needless to say that presents a 
		significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only
		source of doctrine  If however one turns to the sacred 
		traditions of the undivided Christian Church there is no
		problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a
		unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early 
		generation that Mary was assumed into heaven body and soul
		etc etc  It wasn't until the reformation that these doctrines
		were called into question  As far as I am concerned again my
		personaly feelings if it's a choice between the apostles or
		Luther I'll choose the apostles every time whether or not
		it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men
		have determined to be the bible

	Like a said just a couple of notes  As is often said I believe that
we must agree to politely disagree

	Often times most recently on this list in the last few days I've
heard the passage from revelation

	whoever adds to the sacred words of this bookwhoever removes
	 words from this book    

	 used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books

	 I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons

	   They weren't added later by the Catholic Church they were
		always part of what was considered inspired scripture
		This has been dealt with in previous postingsno reason
		to repeat the info

	  It is more likely than not that when St John or whomever wrote
		the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was
		 NOT  the same thing you and I are holding in our hands

	If one takes the translation of this book in REV  or somewhere
	around there to mean all of scripture then all of us are likely
	holding something that is in violation of this command

	It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures even the NT ones
	they didn't like to date their letters I guess  I really wish I
	had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight but I believe
	that several of the NT letters chief among them  Peter have their
	most likely date of composition in the early second century AD
		Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of 
	Domition sp AD   Thus it could be argues that we are all
	in sin if we accept  Peter as scripture since it was added to the
	book after the composition of Revelation when we are told to add 
	nothing more

	If you want to get the exact dates get a copy of the New American
	Bible  I'll try to follow this up tomorrow if I remember

I would say only to the extent that the Roman Catholic Church
neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment as
confirmed in the recent catechism though there are many RCs
who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was
not explicitly condemned

I quote from the journal  Days In the Church and In the World
 No  p  

Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism

	In procuring the common good of society the need could arise
	that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot
	cause harm  By virtue of this the right and obligation of 
	public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties
	including the death penalty is acknowledged  For similar
	reasons legimate authorities have the right to impede
	aggressors in society with the use of arms  The Church's 
	traditional teaching has always been expressed and will 
	continue to be expressed in the 
	consideration of the real conditions of common good and the
	effective means for preserving public order and personal
	safety  To the degree that means other than the death
	penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the
	peace then these nonviolent provisions are to be preferred
	because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the
	final goal of protection of peace and human dignity  

As is clearly shown by this excerpt the Church's teaching on capital
punishment remains today as it has always been in the past  in total
accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly
force in those cases for which this option is justifiable  

I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken
as support for capital punishment I take it that as a Roman
Catholic you are opposed to abortion and would still onsider
it wrong and something to be objected to even if legalised by
authority

I seek to conform my will to the will of God as expounded by His
instrument of the visible Church here on earth whenever the question
of faith or morals arises

kobergspotColoradoEDU Allen Koberg writes

 The concept of tongues as used at Pentecost seems an outdated concept
 now  With the Bible available in nearly every language and missionaries
 who are out there in ALL languages why does the church need tongues

I guess there are at least some people who are not able to support
this claim There are still a lot of languages without the Bible or a
part of the Bible There are still many languages which we are not
able to write simply because the written version of the language has
not yet been defined

Yes I suppose that's true  Of course notice I qualified with NEARLY
every language   And there are missionaries out there who can
speak every imaginable language AND dialect  But then the fact that
not all languages have a WRITTEN gospel lends no credence to the 
concept of pentecost type xenoglossolalia since most tongues occur not
in these places of unwritten language but rather in churches full
of people who do have a written language and a Bible in that language

But I nitpick

Andy Byler writes on the Biblical basis for the dogma of the
Immaculate Conception

   I will put enmity between you the Serpent and the woman and
  between your seed and her seed she can also be read he shall
  crush your head and you shall bruise her or his heel
  Genesis 

   He who commits sin is of the devil      John 

   Hail full of grace greek  kecharitomene the Lord is with
  thee     Luke 

In the Hebrew of Genesis  the gender is clearly masculine

  HE shall crush your head and you shall bruise HIS heel

The Latin has feminine forms only by an accident of grammar

Andrew stated that KECHARITOMENE means not just full of grace but
having a plenitude or perfection of grace The word is used
elsewhere in the New Testament only in Ephesians 

  Unto the praise of the glory of his grace in which he hath
  GRACED us in his beloved Son RheimsDouay translation

I cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies
anything as strong as Andrew suggests nor does the Ephesians
passage suggest that the verb means to preserve from any taint of
original or actual sin from the first moment of existence I should
like to see a comment on the meaning of the verb preferably not
from s writer who is discussing Luke  at the moment

Gerry Palo writes

  Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall
  of man occurred  This involved a gradual dimming of
  consciousness of the spiritual world  This is discernable in
  the world outlooks of different peoples through history  The
  Greek for example could say better a beggar in the land of
  the living than a king in the land of the dead  Iliad I
  think

I would not swear that nothing of the sort is found in the Iliad
but the first passage I thought of was the Odyssey  or
thereabouts my copy has no line numbers The ghost of Acchilles
speaks Robert FitzGerald translation

  Better I say to break sod as a farm hand
  for some poor country man on iron rations
  than lord it over all the exhausted dead

The next passage I thought of was from Ecclesiastes 

  A living dog is better than a dead lion

  On the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in
  Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source
  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul
  only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously
  adopted from Aristotle whose ideas dominated Christian thought
  for fifteen hundred years and still does today

Surely Aristotle had little influence on Christian thought before
about  AD

  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at
  Lourdes  She referred to herself as the Immaculate Conception
  Since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the
  doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed
  the case for the doctrine

Bernadette was  years old when she had her visions in 
four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the

We chose to believe whetever we want but we are not allowed to define
our own Christianity we see in parts If you see something that I do
not see or vice versa it does not give me the right to play jokes on
your belief

It is important if Christianity is being damaged by it If
people who speak in tongues make claims that they are
miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of
the Holy Spirit when it can easily be shown that they are simply
making noises it damages all Christians since many who are
not Christians do not distinguish between the various sects

The more modest claim for tongues that it is simply
uncontrolled praise in which words fail you is surely the one
that should be used by those who make use of this practice

I agree with the point that Charismatic practices like this
can lead to forms of worship which are more about the
worshipper showing off than genuine praise for God one of the
things Jesus warned us about

Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes
the theory of a succession of lives

I wrote that the Apostle Paul in Romans  speaks of God as
choosing Jacob over Esau and adds that this is not as a result of
anything that either child had done since they had not been born
yet

Clearly Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives nor
does he suppose that his readers will believe it For if they had
had previous lives it would not make sense to say Neither of them
has done anything good or bad as yet since they are not yet born

Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate
Easau when Esau has done nothing bad

I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when
what is meant is simply putting in second place As an example
consider the saying in Matthew 

  No man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one
  and love the other or

Now it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one
of them But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in
second place A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby
calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call
simultaneously It cannot give first priority to both One must take
second place In our original example second place means that
Jacob not Esau is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and
obligation and to be the ancestor of Christ

                         

Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew  which says of John the
Baptist

  And if ye will receive it this is ELijah who was to come

I take this to mean that John was an Elijahlike figure dressing
and living like Elijah preaching like Elijah and fulfilling the
prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah  I do
not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense and appareently
neither did he John

This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a 
sharing on the Johannine hours as proposed each month by the monks of 
the ecumenical community of Taize pronounced tezay in France

NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP 


socreligiontaize Unmoderated


PURPOSE OF THE GROUP 


The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks 
based in France Many young adults come there to search for meaning in 
their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a 
sharing with others This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a 
monthly Johannine Hour which will be posted at the beginning of each 
month A Johannine hour involves a short commentary on a given Bible 
passage followed by some questions for reflection  Any thoughts that 
may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be 
posted here We are not interested in theological debate and even less 
in polemics No expertise is required The idea is to help one another 
to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own 
lifejourney

The idea of Johannine hours was born in Taize as a simple response
to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in the
midst of their daily life Because of work or studies it is often
impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection but
everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church sit
quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods There in silence
we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of
Christ

During the time of silence it is important to concentrate on what we 
understand and not waste time worrying if in some Biblical expressions 
we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ The idea is to 
communicate to others what we have understood of Christ not burdening 
them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought 
us joy what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply

Perhaps those who read and think about the Johannine Hours in this
newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others

The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects the
personal aspect of silent personal reflection and the communal aspect
of sharing which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network

BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY


The following provides some background information on the life and
vocation of the Taize pronounced tezay community

A PARABLE OF COMMUNION August  with Europe in the grip of
World War II Brother Roger aged  set up home in the almost
abandoned village of Taize in Eastern France His dream to bring
together a monastic community which would live out a parable of
community a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of
the time Centering his life on prayer he used his house to conceal
refugees especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation

AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY Taize's founder spent the
first two years alone Others joined him later and at Easter 
seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and
celibacy Year by year still others have entered the community each
one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation
Today there are  brothers Catholics and from various Protestant
backgrounds from over twenty different countries Some of them are
living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia Africa North
and South America The brothers accept no donations or gifts for
themselves not even family inheritances and the community holds no
capital The brothers earn their living and share with others
entirely through their own work In  Sisters of Saint Andrew an
international Catholic community founded  years ago came to live
in the neighbouring village to share the responsibility of welcoming
people in Taize

TAIZE AND THE YOUNG THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS Young adults and
less young have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since
 Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have
thus been brought together in a common search Intercontinental
meetings take place each week Sunday to Sunday throughout the year
and they include youth from between  and  countries during any
one week The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore
the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner
life and human solidarity The meetings in summer can have up to
 participants a week Three times every day the brothers and
everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church
of Reconciliation built in  when the village church became too
small

A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH The community has never wanted to
create a movement around itself Instead people are called to
commit themselves in their church at home in their neighbourhood
their city or village To support them in this Taize has created
what it calls a pilgrimage of trust on earth At the end of each
year the pilgrimage has a European meeting which brings together
tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for
several days in a major city There have also been meetings in Asia
and in the United States Every year Brother Roger writes an open
letter to the young Usually completed during a stay in one of the
poor regions of the world these are translated into thirty languages
and provide themes for reflexion for the following year

NOTE  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in 
       newsgroups

For any further information contact BrotherRoyalmaccouk

Edgar Pearlstein asks Fri  May  whether the Supreme Court or
any other government authority has attempted a legal definition of
religion

The Universal Military Training and Service Act of  exempted
from the draft those whose religious training and belief was
opposed to participation in war in any form It defined R T  B as
an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving
duties superior to those arising from any human relation but not
including essentially political sociological or philosophical
views or a merely personal moral code

In the  case of UNITED STATES V SEEGER the Supreme Court
broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit
theists Justice Tom Clark delivering the Court's opinion said

   We have concluded that Congress in using the expression Supreme
   Being rather than the designation God  the test of belief
   in a relation to a Superme Being is whether a given belief that
   is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its
   possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God
   of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption Where such
   beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective
   holders we cannot say that one is in a relation to a Supreme
   Being and the other is not

     It bugs me when I see this kind of nonsense

     First there is no reasonable evidence linking Masonry to ancient
Egypt or even that it existed prior to the late th century and
there's nothing definitive before the th

My wifes uncle was a  level mason  He let me look at some of the books
which after his death his brothers came over and took from his greiving
widow before his body had even cooled  Don't tell me you don't worship
Osiris  You must not be past your th level  You should read Wilkinson's
Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British
Masonry  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a  degree black
mason  I've talked with him though much he likes to hide mystery 
Special handshakes and all  When he first started trying to evangelize me
he told me all kinds on special this and special that  Here is truely a
mystery religion  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of

     Second worship of Osiris is not nor has it ever been a part of
Masonic practice we are strictly nondenominational

I haven't read it but the literature that is offered by the silver haired
apologist can't remember his name on TV didn't exactly come to this same
conclusion  

Khons the son of the great goddessmother seems to have been gernaerally
represented as a fullgrown god The Babylonian divinity was also represented
very frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity
ie as a child in his mother's arems  THis was the way in which Osiris 'the
son the husband of his mother' was often exhibited and what we learn of this
god equally as in the case of Khonso shows that in his original he was none
other than Nimrod  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was
originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis the goddessmother
or wife of Osiris  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with
these Mysteries had they not had particular reference to architecture and had
the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in
perfecting the arts of fortification and building  Now if such were the case
considering the relation in which as we have already seen Egypt stood to
Babylon who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the
Masonic art  The strong presumption is that Nimrod must have been the man 
He was the first that gained faim in this way  As the child of the Babylonian
goddessmother he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim 'The God of
Fortification'  Osiris the child of the Egyptian Modonna was equally
celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings'  THis strong chief of the
buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall
characteristic of Nimrod  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod as the
son of Cush was a negro  Now there was a tradition in Egypt recorded by
Plutarch that 'Osiris was black'  Hislop

It was like a cold slap to my face when my wifes uncle brought out his
cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin  I mean real leopard skin   He told
me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin  The reason that he
started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months
to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately
repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge

Nimrrod from Nimr a leopard and rada or rad To subdue  It is a
universal principle in all idolatries that the high priest wears the insignia
of the god he serves  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of
some leopard  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show or
should I say hide this representation  They however worshipped the spotted
cow

I'll stand by my statements  Masonry is of the mystery religions that all
find their source in Babylon the great harlot Sorry Peter  I do not mean to
be a cold slap to the face but there is to much evidence to the contrary that
Masonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt  Of the Masons I have personally
talked to all refered to Egypt as their origin  Why are you now separating
yourself from this which not many years ago was freely admitted

In article Mayathosrutgersedu dhammerspacific David Hammerslag writes

This paragraph brought to mind a question  How do you Mormons reconcile
the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection
people will neither marry nor be given in marriage Luke chapt 

Well here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a
similar question  I hope it helps

Begin repeat of previous post

As for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a 
problem not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general  
Luke's version has Jesus saying that the children of this world 
marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain
the kingdom of heaven  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies
one for salvation  Matthew and Mark both omit this statement   I
think the accounts are not as clear as they might be  Let's have a
look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable
ideas of what it means  The scriptures involved are Mat 
Mark  and Luke 

What happened was that the Sadducees who did not believe in the
resurrection thought they could trap Jesus  They made reference to
the Leverite marriage which required the brother of a man who died
without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children  
The children would be considered children of the deceased just as
though the woman's first husband had fathered them  It seems
obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be
the wife of her first husband  However the Sadducees concocted a
scene in which  brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to
father children by the widow  They seem to imply that the Leverite
marriage was equal to the first for they ask Whose wife shall she
be in the resurrection  At this point it seems obvious that if she
is anybody's wife it is the first husband  After all had she
borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of
which brother was the biological father  It is possible Jesus was
refering to this when he says Ye do err not knowing the
scriptures or the power of God Mat  compare Mark 
phrase not in Luke's account

Anyway the Sadducees ask Whose wife will she be in the
resurrection seeing that all  had her  Jesus answer is that
In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in
marriage Mat  When they rise from the dead they neither
marry Mark   They which are accounted worthy to obtain
that world neither marry Luke   All  accounts go on to
say but are as the angels in heaven or the equivalent  I find
this last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels
nor give any idea what their life is like  Some ministers claim
that they are sexless different that humans etc but I can find no
Biblical support for this

I think what Jesus is saying here and it is clearest in Matthew's
and Mark's accounts is that marriages will not be performed in the
resurrection  This goes along with our belief that if a person is
to marry at all it must be done on this earth  However we do
believe that a marriage performed by the authority of God can be
binding in eternity  In fact the first marriage appears to have
been performed by God himself before death entered the world in the
Garden of Eden  What therefore God hath joined together let not
man put asunder Mat   Jesus also told Peter and the other
apostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound
in heaven Mat    I believe that this also refers to
marriages performed by the proper authority

I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot  What moralsethics apply to dreams and outofbody incidents
In normal dreams you can't control anything so obviously
you aren't morally responsible for your actions

Hm I get a little queasy around the phrase aren't morally 
responsible perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times
I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who
was drunk was not morally responsible for his actions In general
most folk can't control their dreams but perhaps what you do all day
and think about has some impact on them hm And I'm not sure what
actions are in a dream But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant
about the fact that our thoughtlife is at least as important as
our actions Go lightly with this argument  we are all morally
responsible for who we are and dreams might well be an important
part of that

Now there seem to be  alternatives
 Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena  In this case no morality
applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene' that is not trying
to think about anything evil or indulgining in overly sexy or violent
thoughts
I don't know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences I've had dreams some
fairly vivid ones is an OOBE just a very vivid dream I would argue that
extreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky it is probably
much better to think about who Jesus is and who we are in relation to that
than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams Unless you feel plagued by
dreams that are painful and out of control then pray about it andor get help

 Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own ie are 'another plane'
Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in
common by more than one person
What on Earth is your definition of often I know exactly one case of
two people who had substantially the same dream at the same time and
as they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could
see why their dreams might be similiar Anyway the only other plane I
know of is the spiritual realm I don't think anyone's dreams
perhaps outside the occasional prophet's represent actual actions on an
alternate plane If they were real actions or conscious thoughts then
yes they would have direct moral significance

 Like  but here we assume that garbled text because the dream occurs
in a different environment then different moral laws apply is my guess of
what you said
I don't see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones environment
changes the way a person determines what is moral For a Christian won't
it always come down to what Jesus would have us do

So There it is  Is one of these cases the truth or does anyone know
of another alternative  respond by post or email
Truth I don't claim to be an expert in dreams I'll note that the Bible
doesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak
to us with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear as it
warns somewhere in the OT Given that I would not give them a lot of
attention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something

I would discount talk of alternate planes though The only places such
concepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to
Christianity though I've run into the occasional exception If you are
or want to be a Christian you want to be very careful about ideas like
this

lot  What moralsethics apply to dreams and outofbody incidents
In normal dreams you can't control anything so obviously
you aren't morally responsible for your actions  But if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE it seems like a morality applies

I think that if someone often has immoral dreams like lustful dreams 
or dreams where you commit acts of violence etc etc it may be a sign 
that he has something sinful in his heart  It may be the Holy Spirit's
way of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that
we can pray about it and have it removed  Generally if one has a 
pure heart and sets his mind on things that are holy he will be holy
even when he dreams

Dreams also can be from the Lord  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples
of people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord  

Regarding out of body experiences this is something that we have to be
careful with  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature especially
if what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else
Christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate
an out of body experience  Some things that might be called an OOBE
might actually be from the Lord  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE
In II Corinthians  he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught
up into the third heaven  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE  Does one really
leave his body or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a
spirit be it a demon or the Holy Spirit  I don't think it matters
that much  Paul could not tell  

Be that as it may we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan
to experience OOBE's  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a 
place until our spirits apparently float there  This is dangerous  If
God wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE then He can do that of His
own sovereign will  In the Bible most often it seems that prophets are
just taken up by God's sovereign will and not because they are seeking
an OOBE  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was
caught up in the visions he received  Ezekial was talking with some
Jewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one
time  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision he can do it
People should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits
for the sake of a few thrills


In article Mayathosrutgersedu EugeneBigelowebaysuncom writes
This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults since
both have souls  Infants must be baptized therefore or they cannot
enter into Heaven  They too need this form of life in them or they
cannot enter into Heaven

Are you saying that baptism has nothing to do with asking Jesus to come into
your heart and accepting him as your savior but is just a ritual that we
must go through to enable us to enter Heaven

   I don't think Joe was saying any such thing  However your question
on asking Jesus to come into your heart seems to imply that infants
are not allowed to have Christ in theirs  Why must Baptism always be
viewed by some people as a sort of prodigal son type of thing ie a
sudden change of heart going from not accepting Christ to suddenly
accepting Christ  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly
after birth and build their relationship from there  After all does
a man suddenly meet a woman and then marry her that same day  From my
experiences I've learned that all relationships must be built
including one's relationship with God

   Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a
ritual but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the
recipient  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ
it is necessary to believe in Him  However the Sacrament itself
bestows grace on the recipient and makes a permanent mark of adoption
into God's family on the soul

I wrote that I thought that  Peter  meant no prophecy of
Scripture or as one reader suggests no written prophecy is
merely the private opinion of the writer

Tony Zamora replies Sat  May  that this in turn implies that
it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader
either I am not sure that I understand this
     In one sense no statement by another is subject to my private
interpretation If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians
lost the Pelopennesian War I cannot simply interpret this away
because I wanted the Athenians to win Facts are facts and do not go
away because I want them to be otherwise
     In another sense every statement is subject to private
interpretation in that I have to depend on my brains and
expereience to decide what it means and whether it is sufficiently
well attested to merit my assent Even if the statement occurs in an
inspired writing I still have to decide using my own best
judgement whether it is in fact inspired This is not arrogance 
it is just an inescapable fact

were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word
   my calling would be lost forever  God's Word would command the people
   never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet  My
   bridges would be burnt forever  Perhaps I could repent and be saved but
   I could never again be a prophet of God

Though there is a command in the law not to heed to one who prophecies 
falsely it is still possible for the one who has prophecied falsely
to prophecy truely again  Take for example the story in Kings about the
man of God from Judah who came to israel and prophecied against a king
The Lord had commanded him to not eat or drink till he returned home
Another prophet wanted this man of God to stay in his house so he
prophecied falsely that the Lord wanted the man of God to stay in his 
house  While they ate and drank in his house the Lord gave the prophet
who lied a word that the man of God would die from breaking the word of
the Lord  It came to pass

There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage
you quote  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that
homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals but is likely to
have a meaning like homosexual prostitute  

From what I understand of my experience in looking up this word and 
discussing it with a Greekliterate individual the meaning of the 
word is rather clear  Basically it literally means he who beds with a man
or he who has sex with a man  The burden of proof is on the 
prohomosexuality side of the argument to show that the word has an 
idiomatic meaning nor evident from its literal meaning  One can speculate
all day long that it might mean something else but we need evidence

of the meaning of this word

I've read enough discussions of this passage in both liberal and
conservative sources to be sure that the meaning  even the literal
meaning  is not certain  That doesn't mean one can't come to some
conclusion nor does it mean that I think there's any doubt about what
Paul thinks of homosexuality  But there are plausible arguments for
a couple of different meanings  clh

 I also don't see the necessity of saying the Holy Parents were some
 how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability
 to grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or
 dinary human being

Thank you very much Paul  I have always been impressed by the very humanness of
Mary  That God chose a woman like me to bring into this world the incarnation
of Himself proves to me that this God is MY God He reaches down from His
perfection to touch me Ah the wonder of it all

 Arrogance is arrogance  It is not the result of religion it is the result
 of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one's desire to show
 others of one's rightness  I assume that God decided to be judge for our
 sake as much as his own if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the 
 judge we'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged 
 ourselves  

I'm not sure I agree with this   I agree that arrogance is not the result
of religion and that God is a far better judge than we are  I also agree if
you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one's
superior knowledge rightness or holiness over another person's beliefs

I need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall
into the mistake of misrepresenting your views  If I fall down in this area
I hope you will forgive me

Arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that
one's God is greater than the god's of others or of believing that one's
religion is better than other religions  These are all naturally selfimplied
beliefs

It is selfcontradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong
Were I to find myself in error my beliefs would naturally change and follow
what I believe to be right  Therefore I must always consider my beliefs
correct  That's not arrogance  That's unavoidable behavior

It is nonsense to say that I believe another person's god to be greater than
my God  Were his or her god greater wouldn't I be obligated to change so
that their god would become my God  We are naturally obligated to worship
that God which we deem to be the greatest  Why should we feel obligated to
worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble

Arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more
intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person  No
doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile  Were passive observation
of one's superior points arrogance then God would be most arrogant of all

Humility does not rest in slandering or belittling God's work of creation in
our lives  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another
I'm not very smart  I'm poor  I'm not good looking  I'm just a worm in
the ground  I'm such a weak person and although I don't want to sin I
really cannot help it  Were this person truely humble he would take a
different approach  God thank you for making me the way you did  I know
that you never do anything second best  Yet with all that you have given me
I have been so unthankful  You've given me power to resist the devil  I
have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said
not to do  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself
with humility for doing so  Lord with all you've given me I have been
completely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness  And yet Your
love for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to
save me  As terribly evil as I am I deserve to go straight to hell yet it
pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I've led  Lord
please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring
glory to Your Name instead of insult  Lord I'm so sorry for my wrongs  Please
help me to change

 
 I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because
 they don't want to be wrong  If I find someone arrogant I typically
 don't have anything to do with them

For me I've often found it hard to tell the difference  Often times the
most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most
proud worm in the ground false humility type person has been found to be
most comfortable company

When I'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness I certainly don't feel like
being confronted by my wrongness  Were someone to confront me verbally with
my wrongness I'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for
all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me
At the root my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about
living my life arrogantly as I wish  However were someone to confront me
silently by their example earn my respect and perhaps mention it to me in
humility in private I'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help
in changing from the error of my ways

The hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone
regardless of their humility or prideregardless of their hypocricy or
sincerityregardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not
It isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity
to improve in one's ability to serve God  It's easier to cast aside any hope
of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God's creation
in our lives instead

 But we should examine ourselves I hope I typed this back in right
 and why we react to certain situations with such emotions  For instance
 many of us feel justified to be insulted by an arrogant person  As if
 we needed a reason to feel insulted  But after being insulted over and
 over again by the words of others you'd think we'd either toughen up
 or decide not to be insulted or ignore the insult  Just because you
 can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage that doesn't make that
 reaction the appropriate one  It is in this light of selfexamination
 that we can change our emotional reactions
 

Sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between
what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous
statement of our character  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren  He
would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant
and selfrighteous where we are indeed wrong  The devil's aim is to get us
into as much misery as he can  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci
less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with
hot irons  The way the devil gets under the Father's skin is by hurting
those that the Father loves so much




	I deplore the horrible crime of child murder
	 We want prevention not merely punishment
	 We must reach the root of the evil
	 It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt
	 from the dreadful deed
	 No mater what the motive love of ease
		or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent
		the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed
	 but oh thrice guilty is he who drove her
		to the desperation which impelled her to the crime



This is not a very sound argument for baptising babies It assumes that
if the Bible doesn't say specifically that you don't need to do something
then that must mean that you do need to do it I know there's a specific
term for this form of logic but it escapes me right now However if it
were sound then you should be able to apply it this way If the Bible
doesn't specifically say that something is wrong then it must be OK
which coincidentally leads perfectly into a question I've often pondered

   This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is
not in the Bible then it must not be done  But I don't really
think that's what he's saying anyway  See below

If slavery is immoral which I believe it is can I assume that everyone
else in this group does too why doesn't Jesus or any of the apostles
speak out against it Owning slaves was common practice back then Paul
speaks about everything else that is immoral He apparently thought it
was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard Why
doesn't anyone mention slavery If God's morals are eternal and don't
change like the morals of society then it must have been just as immoral then
as it is today

   What about the letter to Philemon  In it Paul at least hints that a
certain slave be released  Also slavery in those times was not the
same as the type of slavery we had in the US  I think a better
comparison would be to indentured servitude  I don't really want to get
into a discussion on slavery  Anyway although it does demonstrate your
point I don't think it is relevent because the original poster did not
say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not
immoral

   Back to the original poster's assertion  He is not in fact making
the logical error of which you accuse him  He stated the fact that the
Bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized  Also we know that
the Bible says that everyone must be baptized to enter Heaven
Everyone includes infants unless there is other Scripture to the
contrary ie an exception  Since there is no exception listed in the
Bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the Bible means what
it says that everyone must be baptized to enter Heaven  And so we
baptize infants

   To summarize you accused the original poster of saying if something
is not forbidden by the Bible then that proves it is OK ie if
something cannot be disproven it is true  He rather seemed to be
asserting that since the Bible does not forbid you cannot prove
using the Bible that it is not OK  There is a difference between
proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven there are
theories on provability in the field of Logic by the way and actually
proving or disproving it  The other logical error we must avoid falling
into is the converse that if something cannot be proven then it is
false  This seems to be the error of many sola scriptura believers

   I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use
Scripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism
although the evidence seems to me to favor it

Hmmmin the old testament story about the tower of Babel we see how
God PUNISHED by giving us different language  Can we assume then that
if angels have their own language at all that they have the SAME one
amongst other angels  After all THEY were not punished in any manner

If the languages we sepak are the result of Babel then it stands to
reason that angels would speak a different language from us  You do 
have a valid point about multiple angelic languages  But angelic
beings maybe of different species so to speak  maybe different species
communicate differently  

I don't know either  Truth be known so little is known of angels
to even guess  All we really know is that angels ALWAYS speak in
the nativ tongue of the person they're talking to so perhaps they
don't have ANY language of their own

Trouble is while such stories abound any and all attempts at
verification and we are to test the spirit either show that
the witness had no real idea of the circumstances or that outright
fabrication was involved  The Brother Puka story in a previous post
seems like a friend of a friend thing  And linguistically a two
syllable word hardly qualifies as language inflection or no

I have heard an eyewitness account myself  Such things are hard to prove
They don't lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well  I don't
know if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway

Well we are told to test the spirits  While you could do this
scripturally to see if someones claims are backed by the bible
I see nothing wrong with making sure that that guy Lazarus really
was dead and now he's alive

Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their victories since
most ailments cured are just plain unprovable and modern day
ressurrections have never been validated so is it true that no
modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay

That's an unprovable statement  How can you prove if somethings been proved
There is no way to know that you've seen all the evidence  Once I 
saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of
his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer  

It's a common fallacy you commit  The nonfalsifiability trick  How
can I prove it when not all the evidence may be seen  Answer  I
can't  The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove 
anything  

When I say it has never been proven I'm talking about the ones
making the claims not the skeptics who are doing the proving

The burden of proof rest with the claimant  Unfortunately 
pontification warning our legal system seems to be headed in
the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence end
pontification

But truthfully Corinthians was so poorly written or maybe just
so poorly translated into English that much remains unknown
about just what Paul really intended despite claims of hard
proof one way or another  Some will see his writings in
 cor  as saying don't do this don't do this and using
sarcasm metaphor etc while yet others take what he says literally
sarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding

Me  When I read  Cor  about prayingspeaking in tongues regarding
building oneselfthe church I see him using comparecontrast
saying do this because it build the church while doing this
builds onself implying don't do that  It's a common usage
of writing that we all employ and it is easily seen how it
COULD be interpreted this way  Why some do and some don't is

in history seems to imply some pretty serious sin The one of the 
pastors in the church I attend Christchurch City Elim considers 
that a prophesy of a natural disaster as a judgement from the Lord 
is a clear sign that the prophesy is not from the Lord 

I would like to see his reasoning behind this  You may have gotten 

If I get a chance I will ask them this weekend

burned by natural disaster prophecies down there but that
does not mean that every natural disasterjudgement prophecy is
false  Take a quick look at the book of Jeremiah and it is obvious
                
that judgement prophecies can be valid  here in the US it seems like
we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies though I
am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement

The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem A quick
look doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah Having
studied the JeremiahEzekial period solidly for over a year at one
stage of my life I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying
theological meaning in the judgement prophesies Let me make one point
The clash between Jeremiah and the false prophets was primarily in
the theological realm The false prophets understood their relatioship
to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David It is
possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant
which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's
descendants came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part
of the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to never
allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power Jeremiah was not a
Judahite prophet He was from Anathoth across the border in what had formerly
been Israelite territory When he came to prophesy he came from the
theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel
through Moses The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant
after the death of Solomon His theology clashed with the theology of the
local prophets It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic
covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah
spoke his prophesies The judgement prophesies were deeply loaded with
theological meaning

In my opinion both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson
New York will burn prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic
theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies

this came from  Here's his response Kinsey see below is the source
of the figure  percent

There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results
of a study that actually only about  were homosexual  I saw another
figure that listed  as the figure  Of course even if it were 
that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior
How many people have commited other acts of fornication  How many
people have lied or sinned in other ways

But in all fairness the shameless nature of their acts is a
reflection of the general spiritual state of the people and not a
specific feature of homosexuality

Why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality  Paul describes
men with men working that which is unseemly to describe the acts  
Sure there spirtual nature was depraved also and like the other
sins the idolatry the other sexual immoraity and the other sins
sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of 
man's not glorifying God as God and being thankful  Still their
acts were shameless

homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases  On the
other hand none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the
subject  Rom  is really about idolatry  It refers to homosexuality
in passing

Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament
Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer  Being ruled by the
Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism it also
protects us from sins that are against the Spirit  The word is a
two edged sword that cuts both ways  

I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus  
If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature then
those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem  
If homosexuality were natural whatever that means wholesome 
endorsed by God and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrowminded
biggots as some would have us believe why is there a condemnation of
it in Leviticus  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other
sex sin condemnations and there is nothing in the text to say that this
law was limited to temple prostitution and no good reason to believe that
this was the case  Furthermore male homosexual sex was a deathpenalty
crime  

Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament  Take a look at
I Corinthians   Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a
law not even heard of among the Gentiles that one should have his father's
wife  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in 
Leviticus  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it besides
this one  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting
adultery etc he spoke against having one's father's wife  

Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned
in the specific context of paganism either  And there was no pagan 
coustom mentioned in I corinthians either  As a matter of fact
taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles  It was
just a plain blantant sin whether worshipping idols was involved or
not

One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds
of questions we are trying to deal with  He encountered homosexuality
only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was
wrong  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act
straight and fail and he had never faced Christians who are trying
to define a Christian homosexuality which fits with general Christian
ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the
relationship between God and man  It is unfair to take Paul's
judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make
judgements on these questions

One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument
is because Paul probably did face this and other problems  Sin can
be tough to over come especially without supernatural power  Is
homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin
like lusting after a married woman or sleeping around with people of
the opposite sex  I doubt it and even if it is that is no excuse
God is greater than all of it 

Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural
power of God to intervene in this kind of situation  How many 
people have been set free from sin by the power of God  Sure there
may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed
That is a reflection on the people involved in the program and not
God's willingness and ability to change a sinner  Any program that
uses formulas may fail  What people need is the power of God to
change them whether they are involved in homosexual sin or any other
sin

I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is
not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one  Paul's
tendency as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating
holidays is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues
to look very carefully at the good of the people involved and to
avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging
For example while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat
meat he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about
which they had personal qualms 

I don't see how you come to that conclusion  Paul's dealings with
pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order
to spare others not to allow people to continue in sin because it
was just too difficult  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols
Paul felt that there was nothing wrong in an abstract sense with
eating the meat  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty
to eat meat in order to spare others  

But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to
tough  Paul wrote to make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts
thereof  Romans   Then he goes in to a discourse on how we
should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others

Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts  
Since others consider it to be a sin then using Paul's approach
on pastorial issues those who would otherwise be homosexuals should 
sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a
member of the opposite sex  Paul never offers a lesser sin homosexual
marriage to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered 
a more damaging sin

For another example Paul obviously
would have preferred to see people at least in some circumstances
remain unmarried  Yet if they were unable to do so he certainly
would rather see them married than in a state where they might be
tempted to fornication

Yet marriage itself is not a sin  marriage is holy in all and something
that God ordains and Paul recognizes this

 Note that in the
creation story work enters human life as a result of sin  This
doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved

Actually Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell
After he fell he would have to toil over the ground

The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often
fails and when it does you end up with damage ranging from
psychological damage to suicide as well as broken marriages when
attempts at living as a heterosexual fail

That is why we are dependent totally on God what a vunerable and glorious
position to be it  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our
minds and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom just
like anyone else

but I can well imagine Paul
preferring to see people in longterm committed Christian
relationships than promiscuity  As with work  which Genesis
suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either  I think such
relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love
with each other

I'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this 
conclusion  It's like saying How should I kill myself with gun or
aresenic  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to
sleep with goats  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat
or all of them  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts
Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them  

In all these cases the more people or animals one sleeps with the higher
the chance that they will get a disease  But this only deals with 
physical aspects of the question  Whichever sin is commited it all 
leads to spiritual death

Cent actions are the same  When Christian homosexuals say that their
relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul
would have been familiar with this is exactly the same kind of
argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors

The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the
actual act  Second isn't it historical snobbery to say that
only homosexuals of this century are capable of having loving
relationships  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual love
btw I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes  Also
where do you get that tax collectors are sinners  That's certainly not
explicit  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job

Link Hudson


I'm reluctant to comment in this in detail  Our basic concepts of
the intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different  As I indicated
in the article whatever the ambiguities of various words and I still
think they are significant it does seem clear that Paul considered
the homosexuality he saw around him wrong  What you do with this fact
depends upon your basic approach to the Bible  I'm afraid that
communication between legalist and antilegalist Christians is even
harder than between Protestants and Catholics in the th Cent  Since
you disagree with my starting point obviously you're going to
disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions
Sometimes discussion is still useful  I've seen some very interesting
work on Paul done by Jews  Obviously they don't agree with him but
they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant  But I don't
see much sign for hope here  In talkreligionmisc there's an axiom
that by the time Hitler's name is invoked all hope for sensible
discussion is gone  On this subject when sleeping with goats is
invoked I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be
worth pursuing  clh

 You might visit some congregations of Christians who happen to be homosexuals
 that are spiritfilled believers not MCC'rs before you go lumping us all
 together with Troy Perry  

 Gee I think there are some real criminals robbers muderers drug
 addicts who appear to be fun loving caring people too  So what's
 your point  Is it OK just because the people are nice

I didn't say to visit some nice homosexuals  I said visit some congregations
of Christiansspiritfilled believers


Praise the Lord that we are all members of the same body  Let us agree to
disagree

Vera Shanti Noyes writes

really  you may be right but i'd like proof  as far as i know and

We however shall be innocent of this sin and will pray with earnest
entreaty and supplication that the Creator of all may keep unharmed the
numbers of His elect
    St Clement Bishop of Rome Letter to the Corinthians  c  AD

Ignatius also called Theophorus to the Church at Ephesus in Asia
which is worthy of all felicitation blessed as it is with greatness by
the fullness of God the Father predestined from all eternity for a
glory that is lasting and unchanging united and chosen in true
suffering by the will of the Father in Jesus Christ our God
    St Ignatius Bishop of Antioch Letter to the Ephesians Address
c  AD

We say therefore that in substance in concept in orgin and in
eminece the ancient and Catholic Church is alone gathering as it does
into the unity of the one faith which results from the familiar
covenants  those already chosen those predestined by God who knew
before the foundation of the world that they would be just
    St Clement Patriarch and Archbishop of Alexandria Miscellanies
 c  AD

Of course the doctrine was explained more fully later on by Sts
Augustine Aquinas etc but the seeds were ther from the beginning

this is really confusing to me especially since i still believe that
christ jesus died for ALL of us  preknowledge of obstinacy seems
like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses  but

I think you are reading it wrong  I say those who are not saved are not
saved on account of their own sins  It is not because God did not give
them sufficient grace for He does do so in His desire that all men
might be saved  However as only some are saved  and those who are
saved are saved by the grace of God not by works lest any man should
boast  the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to
heed the call of God  They are damned by their own free will and
chosing a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not
predestined but reprobated instead

so God uses grace like margarine he only spreads it where it's needed
and not where it isn't  and so there are the saved and the notsaved
and nothing in between  hmmmm

Certainly God does not distribute grace evenly  If He did no one could
have their heart hardened or rather harden their heart thus causing
God to withdraw His grace  But you are correct  the world is divided
into those who God knows to be saved and those God knows to be on the
road to perdition  THe key is that God knows it and we do not  Thus
no one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect
and predestined  But no one who is a Christian in good standin should
doubt their salvation either that shows a lack of trust in God

be punished after we die  you're saying what we get after we die has
a direct bearing on how we live now  strange

You must admit it is possible  Anyway why would you want something in
the hear and know when you can recieve  fold in heaven  Better to
lay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said
This is not to condemn the rich but simply to point out that those who
are rich are frequently very evil or immoral so God must give them
their blessing know as they have chosen  Remeber Jesus promised
tribulation in this world and hatred of others because we are
Christians  He did not promise heaven on earth  He promised heaven

so sin is either punished now or later  and not both  what if it's
 sort of halfpunished  are there any grey areas in this doctrine

Not really  Unless you do penance here on earth you will have to do it
in Purgatory as Paul pointed out  Corinthians   Those with
poorer works though still done with good intentions will only be saved
through fire the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately for
whatever good they did was not for God but for self dead works  Of
course the Church gives indulgences has Confession and Annointing of
the Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin so there is really
little excuse for ending up in Purgatory  it is a last hope for the
somewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul

And no comments were taken as flames  You are one of the more polite
people I have talked to over the net

ps As for Balkan military adventures the old saw about that area is
that it produces more history then can be consumed locally Alexander
the Great WWI the Ottoman Empire the Byzantine Empire by which I
refer to stirfe and foreign adventures of them in general the Balkans
wars of  the LatinGreek wars of the 's etc  Not a good place
to hop into

I am interested in views about the nonevent of May  Seriously how can a 
Christian discriminate between messages from God which are to be taken 
seriously and those which are spurious  Is there a useful heuristic which 
would help us avoid embracing messages which by their nonfulfillment are 
proven to be false thus causing the name of Christ to be placed in 
disrepute Is this a problem at all

It is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision but that he
interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con
sciousness translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above
that of time and space into an immediate worldly context  and getting it
wrong  Not that he did it rationally but rather that unconsciously the
perceptions became clothed in material images instead of remaining in the
realm of the potential and notyettimespacebound  This difficulty of
translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been
difficult even for the prophets of old  That is why their prophecies are
so often subject to multiple interpretations  Likewise the Apostles seemed
to feel that the return of the Lord was to be very soon in the sense of
perhaps the same generation Yet the meaning of very soon has proven to
be different than they could grasp  Prophetic vision tends to telescope
time so that things that are far off appear to be very close

Another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to
happen again in the realm of the potentialbutnotyetmanifest and which
was thwarted by other forces including possibly an act of divine mercy

There are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and
sincere and sober Christians and others too  It seems that great coming 
events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these 
apocalyptic times  The various predictions I'm talking about those that
appear to be sincere and sober are hard to accept yet hard to ignore com
pletely  One has the feeling something is about to start to get ready to 
begin to commence to happen  We are living as the Chinese saying goes
in interesting times

As for how to discriminate the Bible doesn't help much  There is an Old
Testament passage I forget where it is that says you will know whether
a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass  That
helps eliminate the failures after the fact but in the case of an earth
quake it is small comfort  It seems to me that all prophecies that give
specific times and places and events should be suspect not in that they
are necessarily false but in the sense stated above that all such visions
are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the
plane of earthly time and space

For what it is worth Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate 
could see into the future and predict coming events  His answer was that 
it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti
cipation in them including proclaiming what he saw  If this is in fact
a spiritual law then the answer to your question about how to discriminate
is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law
knowingly or unknowingly and as such his message should be considered
a priori to be dubious  Ie I would expect that those capable of making
true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in 
the way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did  However I can
sympathize with the person who published the prophecy Given the same
overwhelming experience that he apparently had  I too might feel impelled 
and even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what 
I had seen

Do any of our church historian readers know whether there's any
more prophecy now than there has been in the past  I don't get
that impression  clh

referring to Mary
She was immaculately conceived and so never subject to Original Sin
but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life  This was
possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God

I have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a sin
Was Mary fully human  If it is possible for God to miraculously make 
a person free of original sin and free of committing sin their whole
life then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus  Why can't
God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us
sinless without the need for repentance and salvation and all that

I don't particularly object to the idea of the assumption or the
perpetual virginity both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which
I will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in
Christ and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus but this
concept of Mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the
rest of Christian doctrine as I understand it

I also don't see the necessity of saying the Holy Parents were some
how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or
dinary human being  


When Elizabeth greeted Mary Elizabeth said something to the effect that
Mary out of all women was blessed  If so it appears that this
exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity

Michael Siemon writes

Furthermore it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers threw out these
books  Basically they just placed them in a secondary status as Jerome
had already done but with the additional warning that doctrine should
not be based on citations from these ALONE

Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth They should
remeber that after the Decree of Pope St Damsus I Jerome did not
hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon and quoted them as Scripture in
his later writings  And as I have already pointed out in a previous
letter on this subject the Catholic Church has accepted the
deuterocanon from the beginning  And the Protestants in the 's all
of a sudden revived the old theory of some condemned by Pope Council
and Church that the deuterocanon were not inspired

Again why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the
unbelieving Jews drawn up in Jamnia in  AD in countering the
Christian use of the Septuagint

David Hammerslag asked

	How do you Mormons reconcile the idea of eternal marriage
	with Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will
	neither marry nor be given in marriage Luke chapt 

Several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed
but most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less
one of the following three positions

 Jesus was talking to a group of people Sadducees who were trying
    to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa
    tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection something they
    didn't believe in  These people  and those associated with them
    Now there were with us seven brethren Matt   would not
    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage  Hence
    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni
    ties but that doesn't mean other more faithful people could not
    have this blessing

 Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of
    being married and the process of becoming married  The latter
    activity marrying and giving in marriage will not take place in
    the eternities because all eternal marriages will be taken care of
    before then

 The account as we have it in all three of the synoptic Gospels is
    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer  Note
    that we LDS do not believe in Biblical inerrancy so we do not in
    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with
    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latterday proph
    ets  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question
    was not significantly revised in the Joseph Smith Translation or
    Inspired Version of the Bible since we do not believe this work
    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con
    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV

Barney Resson writes

On these counts the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God
To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha
 They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
anachronisms

So do other parts of the Bible when taken literally  ie the Psalms
saying the Earth does not move or the implication the Earth is flat
with four corners etc  The Bible was written to teach salvation not
history or science

 They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
which are at variance with sacred Scripture

What ones  Paryers for the dead or the intercession of saints Which
are taught in  Maccabees Sirach and Tobit

 They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture

By your own subjective judgement  This falling short is your judgement
and you are not infallible  rather the Church of Jesus Christ is see 
Timothy 

 They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
Scripture their divine character such as prophetic power and
poetic and religious feeling

More subjective feelings   This is not a proof of anything more than
one persons feelings

But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that
the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place and
it wasn't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co threw
them out The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't
accept them so the reformation protestants had good historical
precedence for their actions Jerome only translated the
apocrapha under protest and it was literally 'over his dead
body' that it was included in the catholic canon

As I have written time and again the Hebrew canon was fixed in Jamnia
Palestine in  AD   years after the foundation of the one holy
catholic and apostolic Church  Furthermore the opinons of Jerome do
not count  He was neither the Church or the Pope or an ecumenical
council or a council in general or an insturment of the Magisterium of
the Church  He was a private individual learned admittedly but
subject to erro of opinion  And in exlcuding the deuterocanon he
erred as Pope Damsus and the Council of Carthage and the tradition of
the Fathers clearly shows as I pointed out in my previous post

How do you then view the words I warn everyone who  hears the
words of the prophecy of this book If anyone adds anything to
them God will add to him the plagues described in this book
And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy God will
take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city Rev 

I suggest you take heed of the last part of the statement if you want
to take it in the sense you are taking it that taking away from the
book will cause you to lose heaven

It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude He had no
argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon John
 and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus 
that in the law prophets and psalms which referred to him  the 
OT division of Scripture Luke  as well as in Luke 
taking Genesis to Chronicles the jewish order  we would say
Genesis to Malachi as Scripture

The order of the Canon is unimportant it is the content that matters 
None of Jesus' statments exlcude the deuterocanon which were
interspersed throughout the canon  And remeber there are some
completely undisputed books Ezra Nehemiah Esther Ecclesiatses Song
of Songs Job etc that are not quoted in the New Testament which is
not taken as prejudicial to their being inspired

I don't necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it since I see no 
Biblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy  

Early in Church history the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration 
of the Eucharist  It WAS secret giving rise to the rumors that Christians
were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims  The actions were considered
too holy to be observed by nonChristians as well as potentially dangerous
for the individual Christian who might be identified

Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
among Christian thinkers  What were his views and how did he relate them
to the Christian scriptures

He appears to have believed that  He had a view which was condemned by conciliar
action which is often taken to be condemnation of the idea of reincarnation
What was actually condemned was the doctrine of the preexistence of the soul
before birth  Similar but not exactly the same thing

In article Mayathosrutgersedu wyttenumncscsumnedu Dale Wyttenbach writes
 What is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal
 suffering  If it is Biblical please reference
 
 Here's my train of thought If God is using the Earth to manufacture
 heavenly beings then it is logical that there would be a certain
 yield and a certain amount of waste  The yield goes to Heaven and
 the waste is burned destroyed in Hell  Why is it necessary to
 punish the waste rather than just destroy it
 
Luke  talks about the rich man and Lazarus Matthew  talks about 
the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels Revelations
 and  reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are
thrown Matthew  talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and
the fire of hell It seems quite clear that there is this place where
a fire burns forever From the Revelations passages it is clear that
the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever From the
Matthew  passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the
punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or
in the sense of continual 
 
From Dale's question I come away with the suggestion that hell
if it were short might be an acceptable alternative to living
forever with the Source of Life Peace and Joy ie the 
unbeliever ceases to exist Whereas if punishment goes on
continually then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it
It definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid
regardless of its exact nature 

There seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought
What is God's main plan on earth
Why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed
to simply destroying completely those who refuse God

I believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship
with people

The nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more
difficult to ascertain It does seem clear that hell is something
to avoid At a minimum hell is the state one is in when one has
nothing to do with God

In the Bible I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of
hell beyond the general of hot unpleasant and torment For instance
it is not discussed how if at all the rich man can
continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or
whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is
burned up If you can forgive the graphicalness if you throw a
physical body into a fire assuming the person starts out alive
at some fairly quick point the nerves are destroyed and pain is
no longer sensed It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement
the unbelievers who are already physically dead are cast into hell
ie they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical
pain What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are
to be forever without God 
 
The Lazarusrich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener
think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people
won't listen to God even after he rises from the dead The point of
the parable is to reach the hardhearted here who are not listening
to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ
It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is
not even remotely pleasant

Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should

with them discuss scripture with them and only then form your opinion

If you were to start your own religion this would be fine  But there
is no scriptural basis for your statement in fact it really gets to
the heart of the problem  You think you know more than scripture
Your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the Word of God  Just
because they are nice people doesn't make it right  You can start all
the churches you want and it won't change the fact that it is wrong
That is not to imply that gays don't deserve the same love and
forgiveness that anyone else does  But to call their behavior right
just because they are nice people is baseless and it offers Satan a
perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing

I suspect Ann was suggesting that you look to see whether the
Spirit is alive among them not whether they are nice people
though there's something to be said for being nice too clh

LOVE IN THE MORNING  Psalm 

by Malcolm Smith

Moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel A generation
before the time of its writing the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh
gateway to Canaan and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather
than God's way They refused an adventure of faith in God which would
have given them Canaan the homeland of promise God honored their
decision and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the
land of promise until they were all buried in the sand The young decision
makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old and
destined to be dead within forty years bleached bones in the desert by the
time they were seventy eighty at the most The lives of these wanderers
had been unending sadness Moses described it as ending each year with a
sigh v  The fact that they knew give or take a few months when they
were going to die underscored the meaninglessness of their existence
Whatever heights of success they reached they would be a heap of bleached
bones within forty years  The only ones to live outside of that depression of
hopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb who had stood against the nation
at Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land The
fortyyear period was finally drawing to an end The new generation those
who were children at Kadesh were now grown and eager to take the
inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy In the light of this Moses
praysit is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over
All these years as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining
people through the wilderness of their exile he had carried a double burden
His was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been but
he also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh  The problem was
that they were ignorant of the character of their God If asked Who is your
God they would have described Him as the God who is Power When
Aaron had created their concept of God in an idol he chose a calf or young
bulla symbol of power of virility In their minds God was the young bull
who had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led
Israel to Sinai  But when man worships a God of power His miracles grow
thin and even boring After miracle food on the desert floor and water
gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland the
God of Almightiness becomes hohum What' s next on the miracle menu
And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf He might
be all they need but thenwho knows If He has all power He has a right
to do whatever He wants whenever He wants The only person these people
had known who had absolute power was Pharaoh and men's lives had hung
on the whim of his moods which could change with the wind They believed
God could work His wonders on their behalf but they did not know HIM
and so could not trust Him Israel had a God based on what He DID His
acts Moses knew the heart of God the motivation behind the acts From the
day of his encounter at the burning bush Moses had been fascinated by God
At Sinai he asked to be shown His gloryto know who He really was He
had seen what God had done he wanted to know who God was This
request was granted and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious
Person He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and
lovingkindness Exodus  The word lovingkindness is not to be
understood as a human kind of love It speaks of the kind of relationship
arising out of the making of a covenant It can only be understood as the
love that says I will never leave you nor forsake you Lovingkindness is as
tenacious as a British bulldog when the world walks out this love digs in its
heels and refuses to leaveAnd it is not human romantic love based on
feelings and rooted in emotions It is a love of covenant commitment and
therefore operates quite apart from feelings God's love is not an emotion
that wavers day by day it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our
highest and best and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans God
does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings
of love toward uswe do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with
us If that were the case the first ugly sinful thing we did would cause Him
to reject us  He is Love and He loves us because of who He is not
because of who we are He does not love what we do but He is committed
to us pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness He will
not let us go His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us
but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us It is
saying to the recipient For as long as we shall live I am for you  The God
who has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and finally in Jesusin
His coming and in His death and resurrectionis the God who is
lovingkindness Thus He loves us and gives Himself to usHe will never
leave us nor forsake us  Tragically many believers have never seen Him as
love they see Him as power No one will come to faith by just seeing
miracles Miracles point to who He is and that is when faith springs in the
heart  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness they saw His acts of power
Moses knew His ways the kind of God He was and the love that He had for
these people Because of their total lack of understanding of His love they
could not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land Faith is born out
of knowing the love He has for us it is the resting response to the One who
gives Himself to us He is not the force and to call Him the Almighty is to
miss His heart He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force  If
man is to make force or raw power work for him he must depend on
knowing the forrnula and have faith in it But the power that issues from
love demands faith in the Person of love Himself The forty years of
meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to
know the God of love  At this point with the new generation and the
possibility of enjoying all that God promised Moses prays verse  The
language Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its
mother's love now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes It is
waking to the consciousness of being loved watched over cared for
protected fed and cleaned day and night by the mother Suppose we were
to ask What has the baby done to deserve this or Have arrangements
been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience Our
questions would be considered unnatural even immoral The child was
conceived in love anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement a love
that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being The parents' love is
unconditional spontaneousit has nothing to do with the looks of the child
or its performance So God is love He loves us unconditionally
spontaneously We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after
His image to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the
Lord Jesus It is slanderous and immoral to even ask what we must do to
earn and deserve that love The child discovers its personhood and identity
through the eyes and touch through the cuddles of its parents' love It is a
scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or if
it survives will have severe emotional problems And a person who has been
held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the
embrace and knowledge of love from God Moses prays that the new
generation will learn to wake every morning resting with total confidence in
the love of God and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and
gladness Significantly Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His
love Satisfied in the Hebrew language is a rich picture word describing
being filled with an abundance of gourmet food It is also used to describe
the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received
enough water Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be
drenched in the lifegiving love of God That sense of satisfaction is the
lifelong quest of every man and woman When we are satisfied in our
deepest selves many of our emotionaland even our physicalproblems
disappear Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling
that he is fulfilled as a human beinghis hours have meaning which make
sense out of the ordinary and mundane Apart from God man seeks this
satisfaction through intellectual pursuit through the exciting of the
emotions and through the feeding of his bodyhe will even seek it in
religious exercise But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding
to the love of the living God Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life
make sense As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again
became the inheritance to be taken Moses prayed this psalm I find it
fascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His
love Considering the awe with which the people held Moses one would
think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and by
the knowledge they gained they would live in it But Moses knew
better God is the only one who can make known to us His love We won't
find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to
manipulate Him Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and
give us God feelings It is God himself the Lover who must open our eyes
and satisfy us with His love This prayer is man in helplessness asking God
to make the love He is real in our hearts Moses' prayer was partially
answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which
worked by love in The Book of Judges But it would not be answered in its
fullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit who pours out the
love of God in our hearts Romans  In the history of the early Church
we read of the Holy Spirit falling upon the believers This is an ancient
expression that in modern English means to give a bear hug It is used in
Luke  to describe the father running to the prodigal and falling on his
neck and kissing him The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest
self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your
being This is not a onetime experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes
Moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization
that we are loved The world and much of our religious training has taught
us to perform in order to be accepted We have spent far too long living in a
state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselvesto find acceptance
and love from others and from God We now come humbled to receive love
we cannot earnto be still and let Him tell us we are loved to let the Holy
Spirit descend into us pouring out the love of God We come in stillness to
think on and repeat His words of love to our minds which have been jaded
with the doctrine of perform to be accepted We begin to realize that He
loves us as we are and gives meaning and purpose to all of life I challenge
everyone reading this to begin each day from the moment you open your
eyes by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer You may not
feel anything but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS I was Xrayed the
other day I did not see or feel anything but I noted that the technicians kept
behind protective walls They know you cannot be exposed to those rays
without being affected So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing
that we are loved Such experiential knowledge will produce according to
Moses joy and gladness all our days Joy is the result of a life that is
functioning as God intended us to function when He made us You might say
that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance Man' s highest
performance is to rest in the love God has for him the hum will be joy and
the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now
has in life Stop wandering in the wilderness Be satisfied with His love and
in joy day by day receive all His promised blessings

 In the Monday May  morning edition of the San Jose Mercury News an
 article by Sandra Gonzales at the top of page A explained convicted
 killer David Edwin Mason's troubled childhood saying
 
 	Raised in Oakland and San Lorenzo by strict fundamentalist
 	Christian parents Mason was beaten as a child  
 	other instances of child abuse deleted
 
 Were the San Jose Mercury news to come out with an article starting with
 Raised in Oakland by Mexican parents Mason was beaten my face would
 be red with anger over the injustice done to my Mexican family members and
 the Mexican community as a whole  
 
 Why is it that open biggotry like this is practiced and encouraged by the
 San Jose Mercury News when it is pointed at the christian community

Perhaps because there is a connection here that is not there in the Mexican
variant you bring up

That is many not all extreme fundamentalist Christians use the excuse of
teaching their children Biblical morality to justify this sort of mistreatment
I do not see many Mexicans using their Mexican heritage as an excuse for abuse

It is indeed this judgemental controlling legalism of many fundamentalist
Christians that has led me to reject that branch of our faith as not true
to the Gospel of Christ the gospel of love

I have seen this sort of thing too often even amoung my own relatives to
believe there is no relationship  Judgementalism often leads to overly
strict and thus abusive discipline of children
This is not restricted to just Christian fundamentalism it is found in
many extreme sects of other legalistic religions

 Can a good christian continue to purchase newspapers and buy advertising in
 this kind of a newspaper  This is really bad journalism
 
I too am a Christian  But I do not condone the use of the Bible to justify
this sort of abuse  I believe that it is only by exposing the horrors of
the misapplication of the Biblical concept of discipline that such abuses
can be stopped

Just because someone is also a Christian does not mean we must identify
eith them This sort of sin needs to be made public

In article Mayathosrutgersedu you write
 
 I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox to
 the extent that wellmeaning people think they've just flatout
 confused  There's no problem with things being both  and  eg  if
 the  are different parts of the   
 But they're in some way
 different aspects modes or whatever of one God  If you accept
 economic trinitarianism it's possible that you don't have any
 substantive difference with the standard view  Is it possible that
 you just don't find the neoPlatonic explanation illuminating
 clh

I would put it stronger than that  I consider it nonsense

Simply put I do not see any way that a Platonic essence could have
any real existance  Essence in the Platonic sense does not have
any referent as far as I can tell  it is just an imaginary concept
invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in
other ways

So to attribute an 'essence' to God is to attribute to him something that
does not exist  Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave
the unity of God in limbo since it is based on a nonexistant 'essence'
thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address

Thus to me the unity of God must be primary and the triality must be
secondary must be modal or aspectual relating to roles or to modes
of interaction since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one

I think one can read Augustine as saying something consistent with
your comments  His De Trinitate  which has been very influential
in the West  defines the distinction among the persons relationally
You're probably at one extreme of orthodox views but I'm not sure
your views are necessary incompatible with the Trinity  clh

I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot  What moralsethics apply to dreams and outofbody incidents

Dave  you might like to read a book by Florence Bulle God
Wants You Rich  Other Enticing Doctrines which discusses
OOBEs in one of her chapters

In the Bible we have examples of men caught up in the Spirit eg
Ezekiel Paul I believe that also this experience is
counterfeited by Satan  so that for example yoga and other
eastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul to
leave the body and float off Someone tried to sell me a book in
Los Angeles airport entitled Easy Journeys to Other Planets
which uses such techniques

The occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body
departure  the book The Challanging Counterfeit about a
former medium who gets saved tells how the author on his last
trance was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him
while returning to his body at the end of the seance
because of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturally
protected by the Lord

There may be some similarities in mindaltering drugs and the
phenomena of 'tripping'

As regards the connection between body and soul there is an
interesting verse in Ecclesiastes In a passage talking about
old age the preacher writes Then man goes to his eternal home
and mourners go about the streets Remember Himbefore the
silver cord is severed  My understanding of this
silver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul
in a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an
astronaut's airline to his spaceship
When a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches
the soul whereever it goes  and is vulnerable to being broken
astral projection can be dangerous Bulle I think reports a
case of a yogi off on an OOBE who was found dead in his
apartment with no apparent external cause

Aaron  Aaron Bryce Cardenas aaroncathenamitedu writes

Aaron Colossians  In him you were also circumcised in the
Aaron putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done
Aaron by Christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised
Aaron with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him
Aaron from the dead

Aaron In baptism we are raised to a new life in Christ Romans 
Aaron through a personal faith in the power of God  Our parent's
Aaron faith cannot do this  Do infants have faith  Let's look at
Aaron what the Bible has to say about it

Yes let do  Try 

And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believes in me
to sin it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea
with a large millstone tied around his neck  Mark 

Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them
for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these  I tell you
the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God
like a little child will never enter it

The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement
for baptism  It merely says that in baptism we are born again
regenerated and resurrected through faith  In the case
of an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the
heart of the infantthrough the power of the word

The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision
Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made
a part of God's covenant with Israel  It was commanded to be
performed on the eighth day  The early church understood this
and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the
eighth day or if it could in fact be done earlier

Aaron Romans  But not all the Israelites accepted the good
Aaron news  For Isaiah says 'Lord who has believed our message'
Aaron Consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the
Aaron message is heard through the word of Christ

Aaron So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the
Aaron message of the gospel  

And the gospel is surely preached at any infant's or adult's
baptism  Indeed in a very real sense the sacraments are
the Gospel made tangible

Aaron Faith is a possible response to hearing
Aaron God's word preached  Kids are not yet spiritually
Aaron intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to
Aaron God's word  

How do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith
Do you know this on the basis of God's Word or from your own
reason

Faith is also described as a gift from God Ephesians  
He gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults through
the power of the gospel Romans 

Aaron If you read all of Ezekiel  you will see that God doesn't
Aaron hold us guilty for anyone else's sins  So we can have no
Aaron original guilt from Adam

Here you show that you just don't understand original sin
you are arguing against a straw man
Maybe you've been talking to Catholics too much  I don't
know  But original sin does not consist of God's imputation
of Adam's guilt to us  It consists of our inheritance of
Adam's sinful nature  It is actual sin  See for example
the Augsburg Confession Article II and the Apology of the
Augsburg Confession Article II and for extra credit
John Knox's The Scots confession' Article III

Aaron Now then that we have a little more background as to why
Aaron original sin is not Biblical let's look at some of the
Aaron scriptures used to support it

Aaron Romans  Therefore just as sin entered the world through
Aaron one man and death through sin and in this way death came to
Aaron all men because all sinned


Ask yourself this question  Do infants ever die  Then ask
yourself If infant baptism is not valid then where was the
Christian Church during all the centuries when almost all 
of the baptisms were performed on infants  Were Luther Melancthon
Calvin Zwingli Hus Knox Andrae and Chemnitz Christians


Aaron Psalm  Surely I was sinful at birth sinful from the time
Aaron my mother conceived me

Aaron This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble
Aaron ourselves before God in repentance for sinning  David himself
Aaron was a man after God's own heart and wrote the Psalm after
Aaron committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her husband
Aaron All that David is saying here is that he can't remember a time
Aaron when he wasn't sinful  He is humbling himself before God by
Aaron confessing his sinfulness  His saying that he was sinful at
Aaron birth is a hyperbole  The Bible being inspired by God isn't
Aaron limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of
Aaron speech as did Jesus John   For another example of
Aaron hyperbole see Luke 

Who are you to say what is literal and what is not  Is a literal
interpretation manifestly absurd in Psalm  by reason of direct
contradiction with a clear passage from the Word of God

You might also compare Genesis  The LORD smelled the
pleasing aroma and said in his heart Never again will I curse
the ground because of man even though every inclination of
his heart is evil from childhood

Aaron We see
Aaron that he did grow and become wiser in Luke  and   The
Aaron implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he
Aaron knew to choose right over wrong

You are a long way from proving this rather monstrous assertion
All you can say is that Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature  A
conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation
of reason not on a direct revelation in Scripture

David H Wagner			But mad reason rushes forth and
a confessional Lutheran		because Baptism is not dazzling like
				the works which we do
				regards it as worthless
				Martin Luther Large Catechism
				Fourth Part Baptism

I'm afraid that any discussion group containing people with different
views tends to turn into arguments about the largest differences
present  So talkreligionmisc spends a lot of time on
Christianatheist arguments socreligionchristian spends a lot of
time on arguments among different christian groups and the bitnet
Catholic group spends a lot of time on arguments between conservative
and liberal Catholics  Personally I would prefer to have a set of
somewhat more specialized groups at least as an alternative  Liberal
and conservative Protestant and Catholic would handle most of the
traffic though there are certainly significant groups eg
Orthodox  Of course it may be that most of our readers like the
arguments  I certainly find it painful moderating them  clh

 But haven't all sinned and come short of the glory
 of God Romans 
 Those that cite this scripture to claim that even
 babes require baptism neglect that sin is not imputed
 when there is no law Romans 

 Therefore until someone is capable of comprehending
 God's laws they are not accountable for living them
 They are in the book of life and are not removed until
 they can make a conscious decision to disobey God

 A IDLER

If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn't the Bible
ever say so  It never comes right and says Only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised
        What Christ did say was 

        I solemly assure you NO ONE can enter God's kingdom without
         being born of water and Spirit  Do not be surprised that I
         tell you you must ALL be begotten from above

Could this be because everyone is born with original sin

I presume you are quoting John 

  My King James Bible says Except a man be born of water 
and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God 
John   Here man  adult
However this could be a quibble between translations

  We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing
Marvel not that I said unto thee Ye must be born again
John   Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks
to Nicodemus  a ruler of the Jews not a child

  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even 
introduce the concept of spiritual rebirth through
baptism if newborn babies weren't free from sin

A IDLER

Yup in John  man is not in the original  A better translation
is no one can enter as in NRSV  Of course in  Jesus is
addressing the person who came to him  There are other places in the
NT where he deals with children  They've been mentioned in other
postings  clh

While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of
Christianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious
beliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma
to the point of misrepresentation

I realized that my generalizations would probably have problems
under scrutiny from various  Asian points of view  They need to be 
discussed in detail indeed But for the purposes of this newsgroup 
and thread  thus far and in this newsgroup I risked oversimpli
fication  My main purpose was to emphasize that I was not coming
from a Buddhist or Hindu point of view  As you observed the
main context is that of Christianity  But by all means add comments
and corrections as you find them

I wrote a longer reply addressing some of your points but decided
to not post it Perhaps it would be more appropriate for socreligion
eastern Instead I just add the following couple of items about karma 
and reincarnation as I see the matter from an anthroposophical and 
a Christian point of view

 Karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a judging
   deity

 Reincarnation is not the same as being born again

 Reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body

 Reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings
   of Christianity about God the fall the being incarnation death
   and resurrection of Christ his coming again sin grace forgiveness 
   salvation and the last judgement

Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
among Christian thinkers  What were his views and how did he relate them
to the Christian scriptures

Jack Carroll

Origen's work was mostly lost He was not anathematized to my knowledge 
but his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies
Perhaps someone else can comment on Origen  I don't know if there
is a specific statement about reincarnation from him but from what I do
know about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another

I don't know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in
the Church However I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II
from an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow  The Pope likes
to go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he
can relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen  My acquaintance
an anthroposophist related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and
Anthroposophy from his early days  Before he became a priest he was an
actor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner
and based his acting and directing methods on Steiner's indications  Part
of the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy  Well
going to this conference with him a few years ago the astronomer and another
Polish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about
Anthroposophy  They chickened out at the last minute but one of them did ask
him what he thought about reincarnation  The Pope smiled and said 
Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in 
reincarnation and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times
to modern times  Then he changed the subject My Polish friend did not
say whether Origen was among those he mentioned

Gerry Palo compuservecom 

As far as I know Origen himself was not anathematized  He was
controversial but avoided outright condemnation during his lifetime
However some of his views were condemned at a Council in Alexandria in
 and two councils in Constantinople in  and   I am fairly
sure the preexistence of souls is one of the doctrines condemned

	From dhammerspacific David Hammerslag

	How do you Mormons reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with 
	Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither 
	marry nor be given in marriage Luke chapt 

Footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the Book of Tobit
Tobit is in the Septuagint Goodspeed published it in a book called 
The Apocrypha Most any bookstore will have this At any rate the Jews 
of Christ's day had this book It is a story mostly centered around the
son of Tobit who was named Tobias There was a young lady Sarah who had 
entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession The brothers 
all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage

Tobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife  because Tobias was
her only relative and she was destined for Tobias from the beginning


Tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage The 
seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven That does not 
eliminate Tobias her eighth husband Tobit is a fun and interesting 
story to read It's kind of a mythical romance It's a little shorter 
than Esther

The LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke  Most 
notably Doctrines and Covenants 

	Therefore if a man marry him a wife in the world and he marry 
	her not by me nor by my word and he covenant with her so long as
	he is in the world and she with him their covenant and marriage
	are not of force when they are dead and when they are out of 
	the world therefore they are not bound by any law when they 
	are out of the world

	Therefore when they are out of the world they neither marry nor 
	are given in marriage but are appointed angels in heaven which
	angels are ministering servants to minister for those who are 
	worthy of a far more and an exceeding and an eternal weight of 
	glory

Until recently I always understood the term kingdom theology to mean the 
theology of the kingdom of God but now I have discovered that there is a 
new and more specialized meaning I gather that it is also called Dominion 
theology and that it has to do with a belief that Christians must create a 
theocratic form of government on earth before Christ will come again

I have not come across anyone who believes or advocates this but I am told 
that it is a very widespread belief in the USA

Can anyone give me any more information about it

Here are some of my questions

 Is it the teaching of any particular denomination If so which
 Where and when does it start
 Are there any particular publications that propagate it
 Are there any organizations that propagate it

 If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn't the Bible

         What Christ did say was

          being born of water and Spirit  Do not be surprised that I 
          tell you you must ALL be begotten from above 
 
 Could this be because everyone is born with original sin 

In some earlier discussions on this thread I may have
given the impression that even though children didn't 
require baptism it wouldn't hurt if they were
To the contrary when you baptize children before
they are capable of comprehending it you deny them 
their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to
serve God

Have any of you considered that children are not
accountable for sin because they are not capable of 
repentance
Peter said to a group of men and brethren Repent
and be baptized every one of you Acts 
Notice that he specified that if they repent then 
they may be baptized

In following Peter's instructions people must first
demonstrate repentance a forsaking of their sins and 
a desire to obey God's commands before they are 
eligible to be baptized

Since young children are not capable of repenting
they are not eligible for baptism
And since God is both just and merciful sin is not 
imputed when there is no law Romans  young 
children are not accountable for what they can't 
comprehend

You are right Michael

In John  Jesus says Amen amen I say to you no one can enter the
kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit  That's really what
He said and He meant it  That verse is the definition of baptism  I don't
have the law book in front of me but there is a canon law that urges
parents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very

Marty Helgesen writes

   When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention
   the Church may investigate it  If the investigation indicates a
   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God
   it will be approved  That means that it can be preached in the
   Church  However it is still true that no one is required to
   believe that it came from God  A Catholic is free to deny the
   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved
   private revelations such as those at Fatima and Lourdes  I
   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes but
   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not
   orthodox Catholics in good standing

It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what
happened at Fatima  That's a bit strong it is sort of like saying
that a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists  What a
Catholic is free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima without being
called a heretic  You can be labeled other things for such an
offense but not a heretic

Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent
one must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes  Things revealed by
God through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due
to a revelation of God total and unswerving  Fatima and Lourdes
demand our assent as much as any other wellattested event in human
history  Perhaps a bit more given the approval of the Church

Approval of an apparition by the Church principally means that
whatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith

I personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of telling
us what to do at particular periods in history  He gave us all the
doctrines etc  years ago but we can always use some help in
knowing how exactly to apply what He gave us

Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of
apparitions to St Margaret Mary Alacoque for example  The problem
at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into
someone without a heart

The Fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in the
Church we are living it and what to do to save the most souls
possible in such a situation

Aaron Bryce Cardenas writes

   Romans  But not all the Israelites accepted the good news  For
   Isaiah says 'Lord who has believed our message'  Consequently faith
   comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word
   of Christ

   So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
   gospel  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached  Kids
   are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to
   respond to God's word  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
   be raised in baptism to a new life

Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently and that's
one primary reason why they baptize babies  They believe that Baptism
produces a change in the soul of the baby quite independently of any
volitional act on the part of the baby  This change in the baby's
soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have
without Baptism  Since the infant does not have the use of his
intellect and will yet these new faculties are dormant  But as the
child gets older the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play

   Ezekiel  The soul who sins will die  The son will not share the
   guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son  The
   righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the
   wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him

   If you read all of Ezekiel  you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty
   for anyone else's sins  So we can have no original guilt from Adam

Adam was given a number of gifts by God  The chief among them was
what Catholics call sanctifying grace  In the New Testament the
word used for this is charity  By his sin Adam lost this grace
He didn't lose it just for himself however he lost it for the whole
human race  Because once he lost it he couldn't pass it on to his
descendents

That's why Catholics baptize babies  Through his Original Sin Adam
lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents  Christ instituted
Baptism to give it back to everyone

Babies are not being punished for anything they personally did they
are simply lacking in something they need in order to enter Heaven

Often we get into discussions about who is Christian  Unfortunately
there are a number of possible definitions  Starting from the 
broadest commonly used definitions are

 The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition
which includes all of the major strands of Christianity but excludes
groups that are felt to be outside historic Christianity  This is
of course a slippery enterprise since Catholics could argue that
Protestants are outside historic Christianity etc  But I think the
most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the
Nicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon

Are you sure you want to include Chalcedon here  I presume that you 
mean the description of Jesus as fully human and fully devine  Almost 
everyone would consider the majority of Copts and Armenians and the 
Jacobites as Christians yet for  centuries it has been maintained 
that they disagree with the Formula of Chalcedon  Those that wouldn't 
consider them Christians are most likely to object that these communities 
don't require a personal commitment to Jesus which is only tangentially 
related to the Formula of Chalcedon  
 
Thanks John Kolassa kolassabiobstrochesteredu

As I understand the recent discussion here the Copts for all
practical purposes accept Chalcedon  They talk about one nature
rather than two but the issue seems to be one of terminology rather
than substance  clh

deletia Recovery programs etc

I do need you to show me that there is such a thing as
a spiritual need to do that it may be necessary to show
me that spirits souls whatnot exist God is not
important to that as far as I can tell

I get the feeling that we are debating at crosspurposesthat we
do not see the same fundamental assumptions and this perhaps makes
my answers orthogonal to your questions  I will try again

Perhaps you believe that nothing exists aside from objectively
observable and provable things  In that case I cannot show you
that there is such thing as a spirit or a spiritual needthese 
things do not exist in the realm of the objective but in the
realm of the subjective

OTOH if you wish you can simply but explicitly please
assume spirits exist and then show me that they would
have needs and that aa handles these needs in some way
You can assume God exists too if that will help I'll play along

By aa I assume you mean Alcoholics Anonymous and not altatheism 
I would not say that AA handles spiritual needs  Rather I would say
that AA and other step programs help people come to terms with their
needsie that AA is facilitating the recovery and that as part of the
recovery they recognize their spiritual needs and begin to rely on a higher
power step's term to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse
they had been accustomed to  Sorry there is no objective proof here
eitherno way to take  identical alcoholics and try to have one recover
by fulfilling spiritual needs and one without and externally compare the
differencewe are talking about the virtually infinite complexity of
people here

But I should say if God is a necessary component
of your spiritual needs then I truely do not understand at
all It sounds to me like spirits have needs that should be
fulfilled by God but can be masked in other ways drugs etc
If this is the case then you can leave out God just describe
the problem not the solution

Spiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition to
physical requirements like air food sleep etc  These are things like
the need for love and acceptance and the need for meaning in life  If 
one denies the existence of spiritual things one would presumably call 
these emotional needs The reason Christians call them spiritual needs 
is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual 
meansie a person could be loved and accepted by many people and do 
many meaningful things but still have a need for love which can only be
satisfied by the love of God  Now the problem is that there are people who
accept the existence of these needs and people who reject them  Since I
believe in absolute truth some of these people are right and the others
are wrong  So here are the  possibilities

 If Christians are right then we all have spiritual needsie
we all need God  Those who do not realize that they need God are 
deludedthey just haven't recognized it yet

 If Christians are wrong spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain
chemicals  Welladjusted and properlyintegrated personalities do not
have such things  Christians are simply using the concept of God and 
spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies

I hate to belabour the point but the existence of spirits and spiritual
needs cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven just like the existence
of God cannot  And yes this means that there is a risk that all my subjective
evidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals  But on the other hand I 
could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that
I appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals

I suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and
demonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs but my assertion
is that such things are not objectively demonstrable  As I have said before 
I myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism having been pushed off the 
fence by subjective evidence  And no I was not raised a Christian so it 
is not a case of simply accepting what I was indoctrinated with

   On these counts the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God
   To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha
    They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
   anachronisms
    They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
   which are at variance with sacred Scripture
    They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
   subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture
    They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
   Scripture their divine character such as prophetic power and
   poetic and religious feeling

First to point out the obvious While  would clearly be a highly
subjective issue one would be hard pressed to point to another book
of the OT or for that matter the NT that doesn't on some issues in
some way fail one or more of the first three of these tests

Second one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of
their composition  I don't recall the exact dating of all of the
books but most if not all were written after the latest of the
canonical books ie Daniel

Furthermore while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been
originally written in Greek they are clearly deeply Hellenistic in
nature  Both of these features probably figured heavily in the
rejection of these books from the various canons

These may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to
judge the canonicity of these books but as these discussions have
shown I think the one thing we can see is that there are no purely
objective standards for determining canonicity

Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of
the Acts of the Apostles can be found

 A english translation of this can be found in
   The Acts of the Apostles translated from the Codex Bezae with an
   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance J M Wilson
   London 

 Another work that might be useful is
   The Acts of the Apostles a Critical Edition with Introduction and
   Notes on Selected Passages Albert C Clark Oxford 
   reprinted 

This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the
text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic  I don't know if it
actually contains an english translation or not

 Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is
   The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in
   Acts Eldon J Epp Cambridge 

 The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the
early 's  I can supply the reference if anyone's interested

 Now many of the works are going to be difficult to find  So if
you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension
an excellent and easily obtainable discussion can be found in
   A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT Bruce Metzger United Bible
   Society 

Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS rd edition of
the Greek NT  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went
behind the decisions on each of the  variant readings included in
the UBS  Furthermore notes on an addition  readings are
included in aTCotGNT the majority of these occur in Acts

In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes
   An attempt was made to set before the reader a more or less full
   report with an English translation of the several additions and
   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses 
   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the
   textvolume care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the
   evidence that supports the divergent readings p 

I understand that one of the early codexes Vaticanus and Siniaticus has
this version of Acts  It would be interesting to know what the
differences are between the long and the short forms

 Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have including the
ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus adher pretty closely to the shorter
or Alexandrian version  The longer version to which you refer is
usually called the Western version and its main witness is the Codex
Bezae althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources

 As far as size the difference is that in Clark's edition
mentioned above the book of Acts contains  words whereas the
text edited by Westcott and Hort a typical Alexandrian text contains
 words ie a difference of about 

 To answer the obvious questions no there are no major revelations
in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text  The main
difference seems to expansion of detail in the Western text or if
you prefer contractions in the Alexandrian  The Western text seems
to be given to more detail  There are some interesting specific
cases but this probably not the place to go into it in detail

 The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the
more authentic has been hot and heavy  If there is anything
approaching a modern consensus it is i that neither text represents
purely the authentic version ii each variant reading has to be
examined on its own merits however iii the variant in the
Alexandrian text is the better more often than not

I wrote that the Apostle Paul in Romans  speaks of God as
choosing Jacob over Esau and adds that this is not as a result of
anything that either child had done since they had not been born
yet

It's my understanding that Romans  As it is written Jacob have I
loved but Esau have I hated refers not to the two individuals but
rather to their offspring the tribe of Jacob and the tribe of Esau

See Obadiah for example  In fact if you scan through the OT you
will find similar references to the two tribes

In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks 
I came across something that was completely new to me 
and I thought I'd offer it for comment

To keep this as brief as possible let me state my 
observation as a declarative statement and then whoever 
wants to can comment on it  Basically what I think 
I've observed is that the phrase the Ten Commandments 
as used by Moses is not a reference to Ex  but 
rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex 
 through Ex   That is the phrase the Ten 
Commandments should more accurately be translated the 
Ten Discourses of which the passage we call the Ten 
Commandments is really only the first

I'm not completely convinced that the above is true but 
for purposes of discussion let me argue it as though I 
was sure

Arguments supporting the above idea

  There aren't really ten commandments in Ex   
In order to get  commandments you have to get two of 
them out of verses  and the verses themselves do not 
support such a division because they are all about not 
worshipping other gods  That is verse  commands to 
have no other gods and verse  commands to not worship 
the idols mentioned in verse   You can't violate 
verses  without violating verse  indicating that 
the whole passage is one command and leaving us with 
only Nine Commandments  I could go on at length about 
this but for now I'll just stop with this summary

  There ARE ten speeches between Ex  the beginning
of the traditional Ten Commandments and Ex  
where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the 
Ten CommandmentsDiscourses written on them  I break 
these ten down as follows    
     
 and   In most cases each of these 
passages begins with some variation of the phrase And 
the LORD spoke to Moses saying  The exception is 
Ex  which begins Now these are the ordinances 
which you are to set before them

  The word translated commandments in the phrase 
the Ten Commandments isn't really the word for 
commandment its the word for a speech or an 
utterance  It's a word often used for longer discourses 
rather than individual statements for instance when 
combined with the word 'yom' day this word is 
translated Chronicles in such phrases as now the rest 
of the acts of soandso are they not written in the 
Chronicles of x  The word for commandment is 
freely used throughout the books of Moses and perhaps 
it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X's 
he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and 
chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer 
than just a single command

  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the 
stone tablets with the law and the commandments Ex 
 yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He 
has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai  If the 
Ten Commandments were only Ex  it is not 
immediately clear why God would wait several days and 
nine more discourses before giving these tablets to 
Moses  On the other hand if we have the Ten Discourses 
written on the tablets then it makes perfect sense that 
God would not give Moses the tablets until He had 
finished delivering all Ten Discourses

  When Moses did get the tablets he found that both 
tablets were written on both sides Ex   If 
these Ten Commandments were only the first  verses 
of Ex  God would have had to have written in LARGE 
letters  Not that He couldn't have of course but it 
does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to 
two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal
sized letters

  In II Cor  Paul seems to specifically single out 
the commandments written on stone as being the 
ministry of death that which is fading away and 
the ministry of condemnation  With the possible 
exception of the commandment about the Sabbath it is 
difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in 
Ex  as being temporary fading awaytype 
commandments  This is less of a problem if the stone 
tablets should happen to have included all of the 
commandments from Ex  through Ex 

Arguments against this idea

The main argument against this idea aside from the fact 
that it contradicts a longstanding tradition is that 
in Dt  Moses says after quoting the commands in 
Ex  These words the LORD spokeand He added 
no more  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and 
gave them to me  This appears to identify the words 
just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone 
tablets

That was my first impression anyway  However after 
some thought I noted that a great deal hinges on how 
you understand the phrase These words  If Moses meant 
These words which I have just related to you were 
spoken by God etc then that would mean that only the 
traditional Ten Commandments were on the stone 
tablets  If however Moses was making a parenthetical 
commentThese words which I AM NOW telling you were 
spoken by God etcthen that's quite different

I did note that in the Dt  account Moses tells of 
being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the 
people asking Moses to represent them before God 
whereas in the Exodus account the people asked this of 
Moses between the first and second discourses several 
days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets  This 
reinforces the idea that Moses' remarks in Dt ff 
were intended as a parenthetical remark rather than a 
strictly chronological account of when God wrote what 
and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the 
tablets

Summary  all things considered I find it somewhat more 
likely that the nine commands in Ex  are really only 
the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses 
of God  I don't know if anybody has ever espoused this 
idea before it's brandnew to me  So while I lean 
towards accepting it I would be very interested in 
hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to 
offer

Several replies to my post have said that I should get to know  
Christian homosexuals before judging them  I maintain that I was not  
judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong   I would like to  
look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical  
evaluation of the people who responded to the side of Christianity  
and homosexuality being compatible admitedly not all are homosexuals  
but I know that many are from their email responces  I don't  
normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people but  
since I have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point I will

So far people have made wild assumptions put me down because I don't  
have the resources of others and even reverted to name calling  If  
you don't think this is an acurate representation then those of you  
who are homosexual Christians show me the diffrence

Recently an email to me mentioned

Technically the messengers aren't even human so
it can't be a case of homosexuality  even of rape 

The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of
the Sodomites' lust for the other flesh of angels  Again
application to homosexual behavior in general or to the position of
gay Christians is largeely specious

Are angels flesh No I feel that this is saying that it was because
of their lust after other men who are flesh or of this world

what are other opinons on this I haven't heard much about this verse  
at all

On  April Stephen McIntyre writes

  I would rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in
  Heaven knowing that even one man would spend his eternal life
  being scorched for his wrongdoings

Stephen I suspect that when you and I use the word Hell we have
different concepts in mind When you encounter references to Heaven
in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets I trust that you do
not suppose or suspect Christians of supposing that the golden
streets are to be taken literally still less that they are what the
concept of Heaven is all about Why then should you suppose that
about the fires of Hell
     Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED Do you remember the
last description of James Taggart sitting on the floor beside the
Ferris Persuader This comes close to a description of what is meant
by Hell in my circles If the image of fire is often used in this
connection there are two reasons that occur to me
     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as
something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid as
any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart 
but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS
SHRUGGED a smaller audience than those who have played with
matches
     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word Gehenna
one of the words translated Hell in the New Testament It refers
to the valley of Hinnon outside Jerusalem In early days it was a
place where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices burned alive
to Molech Later it was made a garbage or refuse dump where fires
burned continually consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem
To be cast into Gehenna or to burn in Gehenna thus became a
metaphor for to be rejected or discarded as worthless

Lest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart
is my own private fancy I commend to you the book THE GREAT
DIVORCE by C S Lewis It discusses Heaven no harps and Hell no
flames It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED and available at most
bookstores and libraries

                       CHRISTIANITY IN CRISIS
                                    by Hank Hanegraaff



         Controversy for the sake of controversy is a sin
            Controversy for the sake of truth is a divine command
                                       Dr Walter Martin


Dr Walter Martin personally selected Hank Hanegraaff to succeed him
as President of the Christian Research Institute  the largest 
evangelical countercult organization in the world In this skillful 
careful treatment of an explosive subject Hanegraaff documents and 
examines how the beliefs of the Word of Faith movement clearly 
compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic Christian 
faith For the first time ever this large and influential movement
is legitimately labeled as cultic

In this book Hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the Word of Faith 
movement as EW Kenyon and the Twelve Apostles of another gospel 
Gal  Kenneth E Hagin Kenneth Copeland Benny Hinn Frederick
KC Price John Avanzini Robert Tilton Marilyn Hickey Paul David 
Yonggi Cho Charles Capps Jerry Savelle Morris Cerullo and Paul and 
Jan Crouch

The book is now available through Harvest House Publishers and should
be in most Christian Book Stores soon You can order a hardback copy 
through CRI for  by calling  and avoid retail 
markups

The Christian Research Journal which is a quarterly publication by CRI 
has an article in it's most recent issue just released called What's 
Wrong With The Word Faith Movement This is a good article that will 
inform you of each of the teachers above and tide you over until your 
book arrives If you are interested in receiving the Journal yourself

In article Mayathosrutgersedu aaroncathenamitedu Aaron Bryce Cardenas writes
Colossians  In him you were also circumcised in the putting off of
the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by Christ having been
buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the
power of God who raised him from the dead

In baptism we are raised to a new life in Christ Romans  through a
personal faith in the power of God  Our parent's faith cannot do this  Do
infants have faith  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it

I don't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not
Certainly they can as the example of John in utero proves I find the
translation of Col  above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ
which the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ's cricumcision which we in
union with him participate in putting off the body of sins of the flesh

Also perhaps cor  is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism
which can be independant of faith from the experience of rising with
Christ by faith Who says both are by faith This interpretation has the
advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized for whom their
baptisim is not benefit but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless

Like the israelites all of them children included who were baptized in
the cloud and in the sea it was of no advantage because they did not add
to their baptism faith and obedience

Baptism does not impart faith nor is it done strictly speaking on the
basis of the faith of the parent but because of the covcenant promise of
God It imparts grace the grace of the kingdom which can be a
punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy



Romans  But not all the Israelites accepted the good news  For
Isaiah says 'Lord who has believed our message'  Consequently faith
comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word
of Christ

So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
gospel  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached  Kids
are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to
respond to God's word  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
be raised in baptism to a new life

Do you teach a child to pray the Lord's prayer Do you expect them to not
steal They can have faith appropriate to their condition And in the
new covenant we shall no longer say know the lord for they shall all
know him from the least unto the greatest Heb 

If you read all of Ezekiel  you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty
for anyone else's sins  So we can have no original guilt from Adam

But also according to Ezekiel  God will not hold innocent anyone on the
basis of anyone elses innocense Thus Jesus could not be our federal head
any more than adam IF that's what ezekiel is talking about Shall you
make ezekiel  contradict the second commandemnt as well


  
Ezekiel  Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted
and get a new heart and a new spirit  Why will you die O house of Israel
For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the Sovereign Lord
Repent and live

The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit  Kids
cannot do this  Acts  says that when we repent and are baptized we
will then receive a new spirit the Holy Spirit  Then we shall live

Ezekiel  indicates that this new heart will be given by God
in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism It is the action of
God puting them into his new order and not a question ofpersonal
faith as such


Romans  Therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and
death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all
sinned

Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned  Death came to
each man because each man sinned  Note that it's good to read through all
of Romans   Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than
others but if we read them in context we will see that they are all
saying basically the same thing  Let's look at one such

But the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal
death but the dead state originbal sin We are in a covenant of death
because adam our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death


Psalm  Surely I was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother
conceived me

This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves
before God in repentance for sinning  David himself was a man after God's
own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and
murdering her husband  All that David is saying here is that he can't
remember a time when he wasn't sinful  He is humbling himself before God
by confessing his sinfulness  His saying that he was sinful at birth is
a hyperbole  The Bible being inspired by God isn't limited to a literal
interpetation but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus John 
For another example of hyperbole see Luke 

While this psalm is figurative in it's language it is not hyperbolic and
the one does not necessarily imply the other There is not other
hyperbolic language in this psalm What v  is likely refering to is 
what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws which make intercourse and
childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God The
whole psalm is in the language of OT ritual hyssop cleansing burnt
offering etc David's sin with bathsheba included this element as he
did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have 

But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was 
passed generationally That's why the organ of generation had to be
cut That's why brith was unclean Uncleanness was death and all babies
were born dead and needed to be washed to newness of life which we have in
baptism today

Hate begets more hate never love Consider some sin I'll leave it unnamed
since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not 
something is a sin Now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see
what happens If we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the 
stronger our hatred of it will become Eventually this hate becomes so 
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner

Though you can certaily assert all this I don't see why it necessarily
has to be the case Why can't hate just stay as it is and not beget more
Who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner I admit
this happens but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily
so

Why can we not hate with a perfect hatred

In the summary of the law Christ commands us to love God and to love our 
neighbors He doesn't say anything about hate In fact if anything he 
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves So how are Christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others I suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin either in others or ourselvesthrough prayer We

Certainly we should love even our enemies Amos  says to hate the evil
and love the good This can't contradict Christ's teaching I think we tie
up both hate and love with an emotional attitude when it really should be
considered more objectively Surely I don't fly into a rage at every sin
I see but why can I not hate it

but the context really isn't that important My question is whether that
statement is consistent with Christianity I would think not

Hate begets more hate never love Consider some sin I'll leave it unnamed
since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not 
something is a sin Now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see
what happens If we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the 
stronger our hatred of it will become Eventually this hate becomes so 
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner In addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and 
do things which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even 
believe what they are doing is a sin After enough of this the sinner begins
to hate us they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their
behavior Hate builds up and drives people away from Godthis certainly
cannot be a good way to build love

I don't agree but I can only speak for myself  I have a good friend
whose lifestyle is very sinful  Do I hate the things she does to herself
and others  Yes  Do I hate her  Absolutely not  In fact she tells me
repeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world  I care about
her very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life

It's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above  I've
felt it with my friend more than once  There is a very important 
part of Christianity that you've overlooked above and makes it possible
to love the sin but hate the sinner  Before I look at someone
else's life and sin I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see
in me as I see in others probably more  Selfrighteousness is
contradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you
describe happen  If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say Wretched
man that I am Romans  NASB that Christian will be able
to love the sinner and hate the sin  If we have the attitude of the Pharisee 
who said I thank Thee that I am not like other men Luke  NASB
we will hate both

	  It is more likely than not that when St John or whomever wrote
		the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was
		 NOT  the same thing you and I are holding in our hands

		Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of 
	Domition sp AD   Thus it could be argues that we are all
	in sin if we accept  Peter as scripture since it was added to the
	book after the composition of Revelation when we are told to add 
	nothing more

	Okay I went back and looked  sure enough my hunch was right
	
		 Peter was most likely written between  AD
		
		Revelation was almost certainly written between  AD
		
		Odds are the gospel of John was written around  AD
		
		Best dates for Luke and Acts are around  AD maybe later
		
	Again this is from footnoted information in the New American Bible
	the best translation I've come across in regards to giving complete
	historical information about each book

Of course the folks who you're arguing with almost certainly do
not accept  Peter as being pseudonymous  In that case they'd
have to date it far earlier than this  clh

Yes it is true Someone has published a rebuttal pointing out
certain flaws in the argument and recently Professor C Anthony
Anderson of the Philosophy Department of the University of
Minnesota has written a revised version of the argument perhaps
free of flaws and at any rate free of the flaws complained of in
the original version He has sent me a copy which I still have I

I have enrolled in The History of Christianity at a college here in
St Louis The teacher of the class is what I consider to be
closedminded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of
Christianity is  His definition is tied directly to that of the
Trinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in
Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian

What you call the Trinity and the Catholic church's definition
of it is precisely the result of the first Christians getting
together and trying to find an acceptable answer to your
question what is a Christian I can't see what you are
objecting to someone is saying what historians of all beliefs
would agree on and you are calling him a closedminded bigot

You really ought to say what you mean by belief in Jesus
Christ It is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a
Christian Muslims believe in Jesus Christ although they
believe he was a prophet and not the incarnated Son of God But
followers of Eastern religions might be quite happy to say that
Jesus was the incarnation of God  along with large numbers of
other historical and mythical figures

So perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say
precisely what it is in the traditional definitions of what it
is to be a Christian as handed down by the Universal Church
you object to but regard as unnecessary for being a Christian

               SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI

DS Bailey

     DS Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning
of arsenokoitai  He takes the term in I Cor  as denoting males who actively
engage in homosexual acts in contrast to malakoi effeminate those who
engage passively in such acts   However he insists that Paul knew nothing
of inversion as an inherited trait or an inherent condition due to
psychological or glandular causes and consequently regards all homosexual
practice as evidence of perversion   Hence Bailey limits the term's
reference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the
term as homosexuals  Bailey wants to distinguish between the homosexual
condition which is morally neutral and homosexual practices italics in
source  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation
sodomites best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment   Bailey
clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers

J Boswell

     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is
that of John Boswell    Whereas the usual translation  of this term gives
it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense Boswell gives it a passive
sense

      In an extended discussion of the term  he cites linguistic
evidence and common sense to support his conclusion that the word means male
sexual agents ie active male prostitutes  His argument is that the arseno
part of the word is adjectival not the object of the koitai which refers to
base sexual activity  Hence the term according to Boswell designates a male
sexual person or male prostitute  He acknowledges however that most
interpret the composite term as active meaning those who sleep with make
their bed with men  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the
historical setting  He argues that in some compounds such as paidomathes
child learner the paido is the subject of manthano and in others such
as paidoporos through which a child passes the paido is neither subject
nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance  His point is
that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning  More
directly he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno employ it
objectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno use it as an adjective
  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno

     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time namely drauci or exoleti 
These were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects  The Greek
arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci  the corresponding passive
would be parakoitai one who lies beside Boswell affirms  He claims that
arsenokoitai was the most explicit word available to Paul for a male
prostitute since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos fornicator and
porneuon one committing fornication found also in the LXX had been
adopted to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed
fornication

     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus Plato
Aristotle and Plutarch and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus
Boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that
arsenokoitai did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of
Paul    He also demonstrates its absence in PseudoLucian Sextus
Empiricus and Libanius  He subsequently finds it lacking in all discussions
of homosexual relation   among Christian sources in Greek including
the Didache Tatian Justin Martyr Eusebius    Clement of Alexandria
Gregory of Nyssa and John Chrysostom  Chrysostom is singled out for his
omission as final proof that the word could not mean homosexuality 

     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from
discussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers    Cited are
Tertullian Arnobius Lactantius and Augustine  The last named uses
circumlocutions  Other Latin writers include Ausonius Cyprian and Minucius
Felix  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation  By the
sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual
activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife


     Having surveyed the sources Boswell concludes 

   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted
   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter and every
reason
   to suppose that whatever they came to mean they were not determinative of
   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts 

It is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male
prostitutes  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not
disapprove of gay inclination  gay relationships  enduring love between
persons of the same gender or samesex eroticism

  Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostom's use of
arsenokoitai and its form about  in the vice lists of I Cor  or I Tim 
or he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when
Chrysostom uses it  Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our
study whether in the lists or other discussions  Boswell later admits 
that Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on
I Cor  Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange it may be that
Paul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai  
  Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here since he renders
arsenokoitai as masculorum concubitores corresponding almost exactly to the
Greek  n

    Pope

I forgot exactly what her age was but I remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education whatsoever at the age of the apparitions
She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in a prison cell of some sort

She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about 
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so  
For several instances the priest did not get an answer since 
Bernadette did not receive any  One time after several apparitions
passed The Lady finally said I am the Immaculate Conception
So Bernadette was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking  So when she told the priest the
priest was shocked and asked Bernadette Do you know what
you are talking about  Bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest  The priest continued with How did you remember
this if you do not know  Bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest

The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then
But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette

Note This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims  At the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water 
flowing

Frank first of all thanks for all of the great Scripture verses  It
was a pleasure to read them
 
MY REPLY
You are welcome Zane
 
Zane
I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it but I
would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you
I mean were you all caught up in the wordfaith thing but now that you
have read the book you've been rescued from all of the error and pain that
will result in your Christian life
 
MY REPLY
 When I first became a Christian I entered into the WordFaith
    movement  It was easy  I wasn't grounded in the Word of God and sound
    doctrine  When I visited Christian book stores the cheapest books I
    could find to buy were the  and  books by Hagin and others
    Consequently I began receiving Hagin's monthly magazine and they
    still send it to me and also Copeland's also still sent to me
    It wasn't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called Hyper Faith
    The New Gnosticism that I began to realize the teachings I were
    partaking of were error  I started reading the Bible more and studying
    more  Sure enough Jimmy was right in many points  As part of my
    experience I am alerting Christians particularly new Christians that
    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in
    Acts   check these teachings out with Scripture
 
 My brother in law was involved in a WordFaith cult in my area  it's
    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn  Rather then going into
    much detail about this suffice it to say he was deceived mistreated and
    has now fallen into atheism  I'm still praying for him Phil 
 
 The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been
    a follower' of Copeland for  years  He has thousands of tapes by the
    Faith teachers  In the class recently I quoted several of the teachers'
    heretical statements to his surprise  Since then I've been able to talk
    to him at length about these issues
 
 The leader of the Women's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn fan'
    Recently I found that she has been lending Good Morning Holy Spirit to
    women in the church  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School as well as
    my lending CIC to people in the church
 
I'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and
have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies
What heresies
    A Jesus became sin  took on the very nature of the devil and became
        one with him
    B Jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone
    C Jesus was dragged to hell after His death was beat and abused by
        Satan and demons thus finishing our atonement  Satan was ruling
        over Him there
    D Jesus was bornagain' in hell
    E Jesus died spiritually lost His divinity and reassumed it after
        the resurrection
    F We are gods
 
These are heresies  Documentation will be provided re these teachings
upon request
 
Zane
Or what does it do for you  Is it preventing you from going out and
joining up with the wordfaith movement which you'd been contemplating
joining for so long but now that you've read the book you've been saved
from all of that
 
MY REPLY
It wasn't Christianity In Crisis that helped me it was a booklet by
Swaggart that I mentioned above  But CIC is MUCH MUCH better  tremendous
documentation and insights
 
Zane
I don't have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un
profitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity  heresy hunting
 
MY REPLY
Why do you call it heresy hunting  Hunting implies it isn't readily
accessible or available  This movement is the fastest growing movement in
Christendom  Hagin has sold over  million books and booklets  Hinn has sold
more books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined  Fred
Price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA  Doesn't
sound like much hunting is needed
 
It is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error  I gave some verses to you before
More can be given  Most of the epistles were written due to error doctrinal
practical in the churches  The early church had numerous councils to expose
error and heresy  It's not a new thing  Remember Luther
 
Zane
I would like to point out though that historically those who hunt heretics
often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics but this is my un
documented opinion
 
MY REPLY
 If you can provide documentation it would be appreciated
 Read Ephesians  esp vss  and  and tell me what causes
    disunity and immaturity in the body
 
EPH  till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
the Son of God to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness
of Christ that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried
about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning
craftiness of deceitful plotting
 
Disunity contrary to popular opinion isn't caused by exposing error it's
caused by error
 
Zane
There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures as
documenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers  but I would
suggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows and
matures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End
 
MY REPLY
Most scholars believe Paul wrote  Timothy last  Let's examine his admonitions
to Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become
 
TI  Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me
in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus That good thing which was
committed to you keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us This you know that

persecution But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse deceiving

and been assured of knowing from whom you have learned them and that from
childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise
for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus All Scripture is given by
inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for
correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be
complete thoroughly equipped for every good work
 
TI  Preach the word Be ready in season and out of season Convince
rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and teaching For the time will come
when they will not endure sound doctrine but according to their own desires
because they have itching ears they will heap up for themselves teachers and

The picture I have of Paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy
the ministry of wolves but of one who teaches the sheep with many tears
the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into
wolves to protect themselves

of God Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which
the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God which He
purchased with His own blood For I know this that after my departure savage
wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock Also from among
yourselves men will rise up speaking perverse things to draw away the
disciples after themselves Therefore watch and remember that for three years
I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears

those who wish to putting them out of the church
 
Jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines
 
REV  But I have a few things against you because you have there those
who hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balak to put a stumbling block
before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit
sexual immorality Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the
Nicolaitans which thing I hate 'Repent or else I will come to you quickly
and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth
 
REV  Nevertheless I have a few things against you because you allow
that woman Jezebel who calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce My
servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols And I
gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality and she did not repent
Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her
into great tribulation unless they repent of their deeds I will kill her
children with death and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches
the minds and hearts And I will give to each one of you according to your
works

I question too the purposes of those who write books and build ministries
on the faults  deliberate or otherwise  of others  Maybe if they would
wander around in the desert eating locust and honey or barely cakeswith
no worldly goods at stake money to be made or no reputations to maintain
I would question their motives  conscious or otherwise  less
 
MY REPLY
I won't comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others
But even if they had bad motives remember what Paul said
 
PHI  Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife and some also
from good will The former preach Christ from selfish ambition not sincerely
supposing to add affliction to my chains but the latter out of love knowing
that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel What then Only that in
every way whether in pretense or in truth Christ is preached and in this I
rejoice yes and will rejoice

If we want to be true to the admonitions of Scripture  many of which you
list  about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of
doctrines I suggest we start by allowing the wolfprogram in our own noetic
pasture to be nailed to the Cross
 
MY REPLY
Please explain
 
Zane
Secondly I suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships 
which in the strict Scriptural sense is the local citychurch
 
MY REPLY
If heresy was not being propagated over the mass media then it may not be
needed to go mass media with the exposure  Unfortunately heresy is being
taught not just in Copeland's church or Hagin's or Hinn's or Price's but all
over the radio in print etc  No pastor or church leader knows what materials
the sheep are feeding on outside the church  It's imperative that leadership
be made aware of this and CIC does just that
 
Also let's examine a passage of Scripture
 EPH  And He Himself gave some to be apostles some prophets some
evangelists and some pastors and teachers
 EPH  for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry for the
edifying of the body of Christ
 
These ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one
individual church but for the body of Christ
Paul was an apostle  he traveled all over distilling his message  He was also
a teacher 
CO  For this reason I have sent Timothy to you who is my beloved and
faithful son in the Lord who will remind you of my ways in Christ as I teach
everywhere in every church
CO  But as God has distributed to each one as the Lord has called each
one so let him walk And so I ordain in all the churches
 
Also 
CO  And God has appointed these in the church first apostles second
prophets third teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps
administrations varieties of tongues
 
 EPH  till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
the Son of God to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness
of Christ
 
Notice that the FiveFold ministries are going to be around till the church
is in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect
man  This I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns see
Cor   But God wants the body to continue on maturing  What hinders
maturity and unity of the body
 
 EPH  that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried
about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning
craftiness of deceitful plotting
 
It's clear that false doctrine integrated into the church by the trickery of
men causes  disunity the thing we are striving for and  spiritual
immaturity  the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are
tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine
 
The Five Fold ministry of which there does not appear to be clear
Scriptural denominational boundaries pastors appear responsible for their
individual flock is to deal with these doctrines when necessary in their
struggle to equip the body
 
All believers are called to do this to a degree
JUD  Beloved while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our
common salvation I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend
earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints For
certain men have crept in unnoticed who long ago were marked out for this
condemnation ungodly men who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny
the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ
 
Zane
If you'll notice in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church to
Church and area to area were the bad guys and they went after the good guy
namely Paul  who they considered to be the arch heretic
 
MY REPLY
They were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preaching
contrary to what they taught

Ezek  God seems to be upset with the priests who have made no
difference between the holy and the profane  This brought to my mind a
sermon I heard recently in which the speaker said God's second name does
not begin with a D referring I believe to use of God's holy name and
titles as swear words  I was also reminded of the experience of Moses at
the burning bush when God told him Take off your sandals for the place
where you are standing is holy ground

These and other texts seem to imply that God's people must treat holy
things differently from other common things or make a difference
between holy and common things

The obvious questions are 

What makes something holy and How are Christians primarily supposed to
make this difference between holy and common things  eg God's name
the Holy Spirit the Holy Bible etc

Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism

	In procuring the common good of society the need could arise
	that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot
	cause harm  By virtue of this the right and obligation of 
	public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties
	including the death penalty is acknowledged  
	  To the degree that means other than the death
	penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the
	peace then these nonviolent provisions are to be preferred
	because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the
	final goal of protection of peace and human dignity  

		EXACTLY  Read that one sentence in thereto the degree
	that means other than the death penalty and military operations are
	sufficient to keep the peace then these nonviolent provisions are to
	be preferred

	I don't believe that it is necessary for us to murder criminals to keep
	the peace the Church in the United States feels the same way thus the
	reason that the Catholic Church has opposed every execution in this
	country in recent memory

As is clearly shown by this excerpt the Church's teaching on capital
punishment remains today as it has always been in the past  in total
accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly
force in those cases for which this option is justifiable  

	So what is justifiable  As you stated very explicitly from the new
	Catechism the only justifiable case is when it is necessary to keep
	the peace  Since that does not apply at all to this country the
	logical conclusion based on your own premises is that one must be
	opposed to any form of capital punishment in America

I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues 
however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly 
perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality

Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say
fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God  How does this apply
to homosexuals  I understand fornication to be sex outside of
marriage  Is this an accurate definition  Is there any such thing as
samesex marriage in the Bible  My understanding has always been that
the New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband
and his wife  I am however willing to listen to Scriptural evidence
to the contrary

If we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from
speaking in church Paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could
err I find it interesting that CHRIST never discussed the issue of
homosexuality certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious
transgression CHRIST would have condemned it 
I find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying
to stamp out something that CHRIST didn't consider worth a single word
of condemnation CHRIST repeatedly warns us against judgement 
Don't we risk judgement in equal measure when we condemn people who 
GOD himself did not judge when he walked on the earth

 
            The love of CHRIST is contagious       
                                           
                                                   

I should not that many of our readers do in fact advocate forbiding
women from speaking in church  This is an issue we have discussed
in the past and I'm not interested in redoing  clh

Hate the sin but love the sinnerI've heard that quite a bit recently 
often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality
but the context really isn't that important My question is whether that
statement is consistent with Christianity I would think not

Hate begets more hate never love Consider some sin I'll leave it unnamed
since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not 
something is a sin Now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see
what happens If we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the 
stronger our hatred of it will become Eventually this hate becomes so 
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner In addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and 

That is an assumption on your part  Where is your proof that one always will
degenerate into hating the sinner because he hates the sin

I am reminded of the Civil Rights movement in America  It is true that many
individuals hated the proponents of racism  It is also true that many 
individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and
never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it  Dr King's
message was this  Love the individual the loving of the individual would
transform him into a friend  However this did not take away his hatred for
segregation  His hatred for injustice  


In the summary of the law Christ commands us to love God and to love our 
neighbors He doesn't say anything about hate In fact if anything he 
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves So how are Christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others I suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin either in others or ourselvesthrough prayer We
need to ask God to help us with our own sin and to help those we love 
with theirs Only love can conquer sinhatred has no place The best way to
love someone is to pray for them 

I would ask Did John the Baptist practice love when he criticized the Jewish
Leaders of his day  Did Jesus Practice love when he threw the moneychangers
out of the temple

We must have at least a distase for sin  We must in order to fight it in 
ourselves  Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by its
right name  Jesus loved everyone but he called sin by its right name

It is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk but it is
also true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth

There is also a verse in Luke that says HeJesus saw Satan fall
from Heaven  It's something like that  I don't have my Bible in

reference to Satan's expulsion

I believe the reference is to Luke   The context of the passage
makes it possible that Jesus is referring to Satan being defeated by
Jesus' mission rather than a previous fall from heaven  clh

The following was published in the May th Rocky Mountain News  I
guess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at this
church  I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor  I also
understand that this is not an honest way to proceed  Unfortunately
this is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming is
perceived to approach

There is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at any
cost' style of theology  I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits into
this equation

Baptisms draw parents' ire  Children at church carnival in Springs
told they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religious
rite

By Dick Foster  Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau

Colorado Springs  Outraged parents say their children were lured to
a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a
Baptist minister

Doxens of children some as young as  years old and unaccompanied by
their parents thought they were going to a carnival at the
Cornerstone Baptist Church where there would be a big water fight
free balloons squirt guns and candy

Before that May  carnival was over however children were whisked
into a room for religious instruction and told they should be
baptized  In many cases they consented although they or their
families are not of the Baptist faith

The baptisms by the church have angered many parents including
Paulette Lamontagne a Methodist and mother of twin yearold girls
who were baptized without her knowledge or consent

'My understnading was they were going to a carnival  I feel that's a
false pretense' said Lamontagne  Her daughters said the minister
told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not
baptized

Cornerstone church officials defended their actions

'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded
us to baptize converts  No one can show me one passage in the Bible
where it says that parental permission is required before a child is
baptized' said Dan Irwin associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist
Church

Church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized
because 'they didn't ask' Irwin said

Many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children
to a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were
members of the Cornerstone Church

Police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the
children but indicated the parents could pursue civil action


Aren't these the same behaviors we condemn
in the Hari Krishnas and other cults

I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account
mentions  First I'm not entirely sure that parental consent is
absolutely required  This would be extremely difficult because of
the clear commandment to obey parents  But if an older child insisted
on being baptized without their parents' consent I might be willing
to do it  However this would be a serious step and would warrant
much careful discussion  The problem I find here is not so much
parental consent as that there was nobody's consent  Whether you
believe in infant baptism or not baptism is supposed to be the sign
of entry into a Christian community  If there isn't a commitment from
somebody whether parent or child and no intent to become part of
the Church the baptism appears to be a lie  Furthermore it is
likely to raise serious practical problems  What if the child is from
a baptist tradition  Normally when he reaches the age of decision he
would be expected to make a decision and be baptized  But he already
has been by a church claiming to be a Baptist church  So does he get
rebaptized  Neither answer is really very good  If not he's being
robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith

   Hate the sin but love the sinnerI've heard that quite a bit recently
   My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity I
   would think not  Hate begets more hate never love

       If you are questioning whether or not hating sin is consistent with
   Christianity I ask you to consider the following Scripture

       Romans  Let Love be without hypocrisy  Hate what is evil cling
                    to what is good

       What is it that Paul through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is
   calling us to hate  Would God call us to do something that would
   eventually lead to hating our fellow man especially when he commands us to
   do the opposite to love your fellow man

   Consider some sin Now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see
   what happens If we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the
   stronger our hatred of it will become Eventually this hate becomes so
   strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to
   hate the sinner

       That has not been my experience  I've not found myself hating anybody
   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life  As a sinner
   myself I find myself having more compassion for the person  Jesus too
   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are is
   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall  Jesus is our
   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner  In the account of
   the woman caught in adultery John  Jesus had compassion on the woman
   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin  This is what it means to
   love sinners but hate their sin it means loving them unconditionally
   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin

   In addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things
   which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even believe
   what they are doing is a sin

       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the
   Christian  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely
   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it  It was not unloving
   for the Christian to call me out of sin in fact I believe it was the most
   loving thing that that person could have done  He loved me enough to want
   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin

   After enough of this the sinner begins to hate us they certainly don't
   love us for our constant criticism of their behavior Hate builds up and
   drives people away from Godthis certainly cannot be a good way to build
   love

       Again I don't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of
   the Christian  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners exemplified
   in John  and the sinner hates us for it then we have done the best we
   can  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and
   they will have rejected it

       Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner then indeed we
   will ourselves be in sin

   In the summary of the law Christ commands us to love God and to love our
   neighbors He doesn't say anything about hate

       I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New
   Testament  I really think that you will be surprised

   In fact if anything he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves

       Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent

   Hope this helps
   In Christ

 Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian
 
 So is there common definition of what Christianity is

The basic definition that I use is
	The belief that Jesus was God incarnate
	The belief that Jesus was crucified and raised from the dead
	for our salvation
	The acceptance of Jesus as personal Lord and Savior

This would include most Christian denominations but exclude the Unitarians

Someone quoted the following  I've removed the name because it's not
clear which name goes with which level of quote  clh

      And to Holy Mary Virgin is invariably added for that Holy Woman
     remains undefiled
                  St Epiphanus of Salamis Panacea against all heresies
                    between AD 

      For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen
     to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent
     as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord home of the Eternal
     King with the seed of human intercourse  
                  Pope St Siricius Letter to Anysius Bishop of 
                    Thessalonica AD 

On the basis of these examples I would say that Joe Moore was only wrong
in claiming Augustine as a prime mover of the sinsex view  These quotes
clearly equate sexuality with defilement and incontinance even within
the marriage relationship else they would not apply to Mary after her marriage
to Joseph

So Joe's assignment of the reasoning behind the concept of the perpetual
virginity of Mary does seem to be supported by these quotes

I'm wondering if anyone knows the answer to a rather trivial question which
I've been thinking about What was the process used to divide the Bible into
verses I believe Jerome divided the New Testament but I've never seen any
discussion of how he did this It seems rather arbitrary as opposed to for
example making each sentence a verse

scottprismgatechedu Scott Holt writes

   Hate the sin but love the sinnerI've heard that quite a bit recently 
     My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity
   I would think not

   Hate begets more hate never love 

   In the summary of the law Christ commands us to love God and to love our 
   neighbors He doesn't say anything about hate In fact if anything he 
   commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves 

    Scott

I too dislike the phrase Hate the sin love the sinner  Maybe the
definite article is also part of the problem since it seems to give
us license to fixate on our brother's peculiar pecadillo which we have
managed to escape by a common grace of heredity economic situation or
culture  Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot

That said I don't think Scott has adequately explored the flip side
of this coin namely the love of righteousness  In the Beatitudes
Jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness  In
the New Testament it is never enough just to behave well one should
always actively desire and work for the cause of good  In that sense
it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its
victims even when these are its accomplices as well

Maybe mourn sin love sinners catches the idea slightly better than
hate but only slightly since grief usually implies a passive
powerless position  A balanced Christian response needs grief love
and carefully measured constructive anger  Jesus has all three  The
European pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was
devoid of anger do not fare well as role models however much love or
grief they exemplified

My sister is an actress in New York and a Christian  A few years
back Jack her longtime professional friend and benefactor died of
AIDS impoverished by medical bills estranged from his family and
abandoned by most of his surviving friends  Only my sister and
brotherinlaw were there with him at the very end  In her grief over
Jack's death my sister found quite a few targets for anger callous
bureaucracies the rigid selfprotective moralism of Jack's family
the inertia in Christians' response to AIDS and yes even Jack's own
lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life  Jack himself
shared that last anger  Brought up with strong Christian values he
was contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before
his AIDS appeared  I imply no moral judgement here about Jack's
innate sexual orientation nb

Maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive

Ok what's more important to gay Christians  Sex or Christianity
Christianity I would hope  Would they be willing to forgo sex
completely in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others
to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong
etc  If not why not  Heterosexuals abstain all the time
It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders
to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life

The biblical arguments against homosexuality are weak at best yet
Christ is quite clear about our obligations to the poor How as 
Christians can we demand celibacy from homosexuals when we walk
by homeless people and ignore the pleas for help 
Christ is quite clear on our obligations to the poor

Thought for the day

MAT  And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye Or how wilt thou say to
thy brother Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam
is in thine own eye

  i believe that the one
important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament
passages cited above did NOT know was that there is scientific
evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly inherent
rather than completely learned  this means that to a certain extent
 or to a great extent  homosexuals cannot choose how to feel 

But one of the most basic concepts of Christian morality is that we
all have defective appetites due to original sin  Not just
homosexuals but everybody  Thus we are not entitled to indulge in
whatever behavior our bodies want us to

I think we need to keep clear the distinction between homosexual
behavior which is wrong and homosexual orientation which is not
a sin merely a misfortune

This might be better directed to srcbiblestudy which I have begun
reading but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum I will
conclude here as well  A week ago I managed to find time to consult
a Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library
and I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as
used in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the
Jewish scriptures

The principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal
noun from erao erastes meaning lover  This cluster occurs just
where one might most expect it in the propethic image and accusation
of Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH  The verses in question are Hosea
   Jeremiah     Lamentations  and Ezekiel
   and    

	 Hosea seems to have originated this usage which Jeremiah and
	  Ezekiel picked up  Lamentations is dependent on though not
	  likely written by Jeremiah 

The erotic meaning in its allegorical use not at all literally is
evident  So too in English unless you complement it with a phrase like
of the arts the word lover is going to have an overtone of sexual
relationship  There is no surprise here but it is worthwhile to see
that standard Greek usage does show up in the translations from the
Hebrew 

More interestingly and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine
usage avoided the verb erao because of its homonymy to ero say
eromai ask there is an error in Codex Vaticanus normally a very
valuable witness where a form of erao is used in a completely absurd
context   Samuel  where the  meaning must be say

In addition to the above and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs
Esther  uses the verb in its most natural application 

	kai erasthe ho basileus Esther    and the King loved Esther

and rather more interestingly  Samuel  supplies a modest degree of
support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan

	kai Ionathan huios Saoul eireito ton Dauid sphodra
	 and Jonathan Saul's son loved David intensely

	 I'm using the bracketed i for iota subscript which I
	  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for 

The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about
the historical facts but just that a quasiofficial translation of
the Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the
erotic verb in this context  Given the quite general usage of agapao
for erotic senses this need not mean anything more than agapao alone
would mean but it DOES disambiguate the relationship as far as this
translator goes

      I believe with everything in my heart that on May   the city of
 Portland Oregon in the country of the United States of America will be hit
 with a catastrophic and disastrous earthquake
 By now we know that this did not come to pass

Surprise surprise I sure didn't lose any sleep over it and I live there

Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous  For me my greatest fears
in this area would be the following
were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word
   my calling would be lost forever  God's Word would command the people
   never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet  My
   bridges would be burnt forever  Perhaps I could repent and be saved but
   I could never again be a prophet of God

Suppose someone said that he was sure that he would return from death
in glory and power flying in the clouds with the host of heavensoon within
the lifetimes of those then standing with him  and  years went by without
any such event He also asserted so they say himself to be God

 questions

	 Is that one of those false prophecies you were talking about
	 Does that make the speaker a false prophet

Speak directly  If the Lord has given you something to say say it
But before I declare thus sayeth the Lord I'd better know for certain
without a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition
and relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely
certain again without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no
possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining
recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers

Uhh  Has it occurred to you that there is no way to know any of these
things for certain without the tiniest shadow of a doubt That people
who thought they did have also been deluded

Those of us who believe in actually being able to CHECK our opinions
have an out  we can check against some external reality Those who
assert that beliefs entertained without evidence or even despite evidence
have a special virtue ie faith are out of luck  and this is the
result

It's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in
contrast against this backdrop of falsehood  When we say thus sayeth the
Lord it happens  When we pray prayer is answered because we prayed right
When we say we're christians we really mean it

           Dan

You want to demonstrate Christian honesty Great
Start with the prophecy above  what can we conclude about the speaker

that God gives that forced choice to gays  Sex or Christianity is a
false dichotomy

 To tell the truth gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII
 starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce or is
 this a myth  Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are
 Christian

For my part gay churches remind me of blacks starting their own churches
either because they were not allowed at all in the white churches or at
best only with special restrictions that did not apply to white members

dhammerspacific David Hammerslag writes

This paragraph brought to mind a question  How do you Mormons reconcile
the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection
people will neither marry nor be given in marriage Luke chapt 

Here is the short answer because only
certain marriages are recorded in Heaven

Now for the long answer

In Doctrine and Covenants section  the 
chapter discussing eternal marriage and yes
plural marriage the distinction between
sealings under the priesthood and other 
marriages is revealed  

When the children of this world marry or are
given in marriage when they receive the 
resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are
given in marriage Luke 
Jesus was simply teaching that marriages until
death do you part are not in force after death

However the Doctrine and Covenants continues 
describing eternal marriage

DC 
   And again verily I say unto you if a 
man marry a wife by my word which is my law and
by the new and everlasting covenant and it is
sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise
by him who is anointed this power and the keys 
of this priesthood   shortened for brevity AI
and shall be of full force when they are out of
the world and they shall pass by the angels 
and the gods which are set there to their 
exhaltation and glory in all things as hath been 
sealed upon their heads which glory shall be a 
fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever
and ever

The Lord told Peter whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven Matt 
Do you doubt that Peter was given the power to 
perform sealings
Peter thought so because he taught that husbands
and wives were heirs together of the grace of
life  Peter 

In order to obtain the highest degree of
celestial glory a man must enter into this
order of the priesthood DC 
When a man and wife are sealed they truly become 
one flesh because their eternal increase 
destinies are enjoined completely

Our Father has an eternal companion and maybe
more because of the plural marriage conditions
of the law who participated in our creation
and is equally concerned with our progress here

There is no scriptural basis for this doctrine
If fact the only mention of our Mother is in
one verse of a hymn written early in the history
of the Church

    O My Father

    I had learned to call thee Father
    Through thy Spirit from on high
    But until the key of knowledge
    Was restored I knew not why
    In the heav'ns are parents single
    No the thought makes reason stare
    Truth is reason truth eternal
    Tells me I've a mother there

Why don't we hear more about our Mother

  Because our Father presides under Priesthood
authority which is not a calling for Her

  Because we don't all necessarily have the
same Mother it would be confusing for worship

  Because our Father wishes to withhold Her
name and titles because of how some people
degrade sacred things

  I'm leaning SIRACH is more directly referenced by JAMES
  than JOB or RUTH is in any NT verse I've seen

It would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from SIRACH and
from JAMES

Job  He taketh the wise in their craftiness seems to be
quoted in  Corinthians 

James  You have heard of the patience of Job while not a
quote implies that James and his listeners are familiar with a
story of a man named Job who exhibited exemplary patience It is
possible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew
Bible but rather another similar and related story One has the
same problem with direct quotes

Again Matthew  Boaz begat Obed of Ruth tells us that Matthew
knew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz
and  became the ancestor of David Since Ruth is not mentioned in
the OT outside the Book of Ruth it seems likely that Matthew was
familiar with the book and respected it and thought Ruth important
enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy

References like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his
OT source inspired or inerrant or canonical But neither do direct
quotes

  Public revelation which is the basis of Catholic doctrine ended
  with the death of St John the last Apostle Nothing new can be

Every so often the Pope declares that some departed Christian is
now in Heaven and may be invoked in the public rites of the Church
It is my understanding that Roman Catholics believe that such
declarations by the Pope are infallible I see three possibilities
      The Church has received a Public Revelation since the death
of for example Joan of Arc
      The Church was given a list before the death of St John
which had Joan's name on it
      There is no public revelation about Joan and Roman
Catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace or
even that she is a historical character

Joe Moore writes

  Paul repeatedly talks about the thorn in his side Some think
  it refers to lust others pride but who knows Whatever the
  thorn was apparently it was not compatible with Christianity
  yet does that make his epistles any less

Paul mentions his thorn SKOLOPS actually a sharp stake in 
Corinthians 

  And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of
  revelations a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of
  Satan to harass me to keep me from being too elated Three
  times I besought the Lord about this that it should leave me
  but he said to me My grace is sufficient for you for my
  power is made perfectr in weakness

He does not explain what it was but it need not have been a moral
problem  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes He
ordinarily dictated his letters and then added a personal note and
his signature At the end of the letter to the Galatians he says
See I am writing in large letters with my own hand or else See
what a long letter I have written with my own hand If the former
translation is adopted it seems that Paul could not write in the
small script of a practiced writer but needed to make his letters
larger and this suggests eye problems Again he says to the
Galatians 

  You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached
  the gospel to you at first and although my condition was a trial
  to you you did not scorn or despise me but received me as an
  angel of God For I bear you witness that if possible you
  would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me

Perhaps this last line means simply You would have done anything
for me not withholding your most precious possessions your eyes
But in that case we would expect some wording like If I had
needed them If it were possible sounds as though the bodily
ailment was connected with his eyes

William Barclay in his volume on Acts makes a more specific
suggestion  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia he
had been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor If he had had
a malarial attack while there a doctor would have advised him to
leave the low country and head for the hills Malaria might well
have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision

Bruce Webster writes
Indeed LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly cf DC 

Hi Bruce  How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 
Ezekiel  The soul who sins is the one who will die  The son will not
share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the
son  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and
the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him

Actually in DC  the parents are being held accountable for
their own sins  Specifically they are accountable for their failure
to teach their children properly  If I fail to teach my children
that stealing is wrong then I am responsible for their theft if they
later indulge in such behavior

This is very similar to the instructions Ezekiel was given in
Eze   If Ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked 
not only would the wicked die in his sins but the Lord would hold
Ezekiel responsible  Similarly parents are responsible to teach
their children right from wrong  I suspect most Christians and
Jews etc would agree that parents have this responsibility

Ever since I was a kid and learned to tell when I was in a 
dream I have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems
In my dreams I have done everything from yell at my mom
to machinegunning zombies not to mention myriad sexual
fantasies I have deliberately done things that I would never
do in real life I understand the need to control ones
thoughts but I always felt that dreams were format free
no morals no ethics no physical laws though sometimes I would 
have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom

Is this an incorrect attitude Rather than weakening my inhibitions
I could argue that I got certain things out of my system by 
experiencing them in dreams By analyzing a dream I can determine
if I have a problem with a certain situation ie in a dream
something will be exagerated that I can then contemplate and
see if it really bothers me or not

I can't believe that other people don't do the same It seems 
silly to attach moral significance to dreams

I think that this is entirely different from out of body
experiences which I have never had

Contradictions welcome

From a long article Available through an individual on this newsgroup

About scripture being against homosexuality

When we  are
less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian  people
engaging in loving voluntary erotic relations with each other aren't  even
mentioned in the Bible tk


This frightens me not in the homophobic sense but intellectually
especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church

So if my interpretation is different than theirs I am homophobic  This
can't be right Disagreement in interpretation of the Bible andor rejection
of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia

      In one sense no statement by another is subject to my private
 interpretation If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians
 lost the Pelopennesian War I cannot simply interpret this away
 because I wanted the Athenians to win Facts are facts and do not go
 away because I want them to be otherwise
      In another sense every statement is subject to private
 interpretation in that I have to depend on my brains and
 expereience to decide what it means and whether it is sufficiently
 well attested to merit my assent Even if the statement occurs in an
 inspired writing I still have to decide using my own best
 judgement whether it is in fact inspired This is not arrogance 
 it is just an inescapable fact

Yes there are these two senses of interpretation and certainly our
decision to accept Scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own
private opinion  However when reading Scripture we have to remember
that the Scriptures were given by God for our instruction and that
the interpretation that matters is the one God intended  For example
if I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches the
doctrine of reincarnation I am wrong because that is not the intended
interpretation  The prophets didn't make up this teaching it came
from God and we must accept it as such  This necessarily means that
our private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning God
intended to convey  Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to
determine what this meaning is but this very fact should make us
recognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically
accepted as the infallible interpretation of God  We need to test the
spirits to see if they are from God  When the Holy Spirit speaks he
says the same thing to all he won't tell me that a passage means one
thing and tell you it means another  If the two of us come to
conflicting conclusions we can't both be completely right  We know
our interpretations are reliable only when the Church as a whole
agrees on what Scripture means  This is how we know the doctrines of
the Trinity the dual nature of Christ etc infallibly  These
matters are not up for private interpretation

This is the reason Peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of
the false teachers  They preferred their own private interpretation
to the Godgiven teaching of the apostles  It is through such private
interpretation that the traditions of men so soundly denounced in
Scripture are started

This was crossposted to a zillion groups  I don't intend to
carry an entire discussion crossposted from altsex particularly
one whose motivation seems to be having a fun argument  However
I thought readers might be interested to know about the
discussion there  clh

I intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an
immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call it  I intend to
show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this
statement  I intend to also show that such a declaration can be 
made without there being a religious justification for morality
in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist

Anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side
ie that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral
or that collaterally it is a morally valid practice is free to do
so  I think there are a lot of people who don't believe one can have
a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it

This should be fun to try and figure this out and I want to try and
expose no pun intended my ideas and see other people's and see where
their ideas are standing  As I'm not sure what groups would be interested
in this discussion I will be posting an announcement of it to several
and if someone thinks of appropriate groups let me know

If someone on here doesn't receive altsex let me know and I'll make
an exception to my usual policy and set up a mailing list to automatically
distribute it in digest format to anyone who wants to receive it as I'll
use that as the main forum for this  By exception to usual policy is
that I normally charge for this but for the duration the service will be
available at no charge to anyone who has an address reachable on Internet
or Bitnet

I decided to start this dialog when I realized there was a much larger
audience on usenet  internet than on the smaller BBS networks

To give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger this will 
begin on Monday May  to give people who want to make the response
time to identify themselves  Anonymous postings are acceptable since
some people may not wish to identify themselves  Also if someone else
wants to get in on my side they are free to do so  

This should be much more interesting than Abortion debates

 Jesus is talking with the
apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can 
come Elijah must first come Jesus replies that Elijah has come but they did 
not recognize him It then says that the apostles perceived that he was referi
ng 
to John the Baptist This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation

This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus time that Elijah
would return again as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and
did not actually die  However Jesus was referring to John the
Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John
remember Elijah didnt die but that John was a similar prophet to
Elijah 

There is no question of similarity in Jesus indication about John
The passage in Matthew is very direct  Where Luke  reports
the angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ in the 
power and spirit of Elias In Matthew   Jesus himself says of John
   
   And if you care to accept it he himself is Elijah who
    was to come

It is interesting that Jesus prepended the words If you care to accept
it as if to say that the implications of this truth namely of rein
carnation I will not force on you but for those who can accept it here it
is  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other
topics has outlined the esoteric cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of
reincarnation and Karma a teaching that is little known among Jews
today but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah
Hurnard Hinds Feet on High Places was told about it by a Rabbi
she was trying to convert back in the s as a missionary in Palestine
Thus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this
whereas the large number of people did not  The statement of Jesus about 
John the greatest human personality in the New Testament is guarded
but nevertheless quite direct  Again the subject of reincarnation one
way or another is not a subject of the New Testament nor is the fate in general
of the human being between death and the last judgement  But there are 
occasional indications that point to it

As for the popular belief that Elijah would come again it was more than 
a popular belief as Jesus confirms it in more than one place and he never 
corrected those who were expecting Elijah   for example those who thought 
that Jesus himself be he

Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes
the theory of a succession of lives

I wrote that the Apostle Paul in Romans  speaks of God as
choosing Jacob over Esau and adds that this is not as a result of
anything that either child had done since they had not been born
yet

Clearly Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives nor
does he suppose that his readers will believe it For if they had
had previous lives it would not make sense to say Neither of them
has done anything good or bad as yet since they are not yet born


Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not
a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past just as the fate of the
man born blind John  was not  There is no question here of the
simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner
of one's destiny  Even the eastern traditions or many of them
do not say that as one knowledgeable poster pointed out

And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation
does not say anything one way or another about it  Even John the Baptist
who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah Matt  does not appear to 
have been aware of it at least at the point at which he was asked But 
it is interesting that his threefold denial  to the question whether 
he is the Christ the Prophet ie Isaiah or Elijah is emphatic in 
the first case and very weak in the third

I would like to add once again that while it is important to discuss the
different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated
earth lives one way or another what I really see as important in our
time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of
Christianity and Christian doctrine  For the most part those who do
accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or if they
are Christians hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure
I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring
to bear on it and vice versa much that is central to Christianity
takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth
lives It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed 
in this newsgroup in particular

I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives
largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner  Not that I hold him as an
authority but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light
of these ideas  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar
nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later
times after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first
two millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha  In our own time it becomes 
important that having received the basic gospel of salvation our 
understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the 
significance of this idea  For the discussions in this newsgroup I 
have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible 
to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition

I don't want to malign this Hislop fellow whoever he may be as I have only 
heard the arguments at second hand but both of the arguments seemed to turn 
on false etymology that SEEMED to be derived from Hislop

I would be interested in knowing more about these things 

The first one claimed that the word church was derived from the Greek 
cyclos and that it was therefore related to the worship of Circe

I don't know if Hislop is the source of this assertion but it does seem to 
be based on false etymology

The second claimed an etymological relationship between Ishtar and 
Easter which seemed to be even more fanciful and farfetched than some 
of the wilder notions of the British Israelites

Regarding the latter as far as I have been able to find out Easter is 
derived from the old English name for April  Eosturmonath The Venerable 
Bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called Eostre but 
apart from that reference I have not been able to find out anything more 
about her It also seems that the term Easter is only used by the English 
and those they evangelized The Germans for example also use the term 
Ostern but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries

So I would be interested in any evidence of Easter being used for Pascha 
by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo
Saxons and their offshoots Such evidence might support the claims of those 
who appear to derive the theory from Hislop

see below

I won't quote any of it but there are several errors in the article
Not things that are just differences of opinion but the writer just
plain has his facts confused

For example Kip McKean was asked to come to the Lexington church
by the leaders there He brought no team He actually had been in
Charleston IL up to that point He had many friends even leaders in
Gainesville telling him not to go because people in the Northeast
weren't open and he'd be wasting his time and talents Really
This fact was a kind of inside joke at one point after the church
in Boston took off so well Not open indeed 

I could take it on point by point but I am not in a position to know
one way or the other about some things in the article I just wanted
to point out that it contains misinformation

Michael The kind of interpretation I see as incredibly perverse is
Michael that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket
Michael equation of homosexual behavior and rape  Since Christians
Michael citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have
Michael at least READ the story it amounts to slander  a charge
Michael that homosexuality  rape  to use that against us

and

Michael  It is just
Michael as wrong though slightly less incendiary so it's a
Michael secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent to equate
Michael homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the
Michael rape of God's messengers

Let's review the Sodom and Gomorrah story briefly  It states
clearly that the visitors were angels  But all the men from every
part of the city of Sodomboth young and oldsurrounded the
house  They called to Lot Where are the men who came to 
you tonight  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex 
with them'  

For the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men
of Sodom and by Lot as men  Furthermore we know from Gen 
that the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sinbefore
the angels visited the city  It is clear that the grievous sin
of Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex  It appears that
the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had
group orgies in the public squarewhich simply indicates 
the extremity of their depravity  It does not show that lesser 
degrees of homosexuality are not sinful as Michael would have us
believe

Ultimately our understanding of God's will for sexuality comes from
the creation storynot solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah  He
created us male and female and instituted marriage as a relationship
between one male and one female Therefore a man will leave his
father and mother and be united with his wife and they will become
one flesh  This marriage relationship is the only sexual
relationship which God blesses and sanctions He regulates and
protects the marriage of man and woman and even uses it as a picture
of the relationship between himself and his church  But we find not
one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between 
two men or between two women

Everything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from
or expresses God's will in instituting and blessing marriage  Thus
the Levitical code which was given only to the Jews forbade incest
homosexuality bestiality the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and
the coveting of our neighbor's wife other commandments forbade rape
The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and
perverse Jude  because they abandoned andor polluted the marriage
relationship  Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as unnatural'
Romans not because this was simply Paul's opinion
but because it was contrary to God's purpose in creating us
male and female
  
Michael Christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here
Michael and in every corner of USENET and the world and ALL they
Michael ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously
Michael have never thought about maybe never even read in TOTAL
Michael ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest
Michael charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
Michael manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they
Michael suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss
Michael our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what
Michael it is

Seeing as how TheTwoBabylons has been brought up again
  Its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious
 
C Wingate       

Maybe you should dig a little further Charles  Hislop's scholarship was
accepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which at the time was the premere
Institute for Oriental studies  As I've stated over and over  I've checked
out about  of his references most are now out of print or in private
libraries and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit  THey
too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself you will
find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed  Both were
highly honored by the British Oriental Museum  Wilkerson is known as one of
the leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still
being refered two after  yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions  He
was recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology  

Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have
misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions  Hislop did not  His conclusions
do not tickle the ears that much is self evident  But to assert that his
conclusions are spurious is without merit  He gave references to all his
conclusions and as I have stated for the last  years I have used his
conclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods not to mention the
individual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one  No counter to
Hislops scholarship was made  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions
because they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC He was showing that
the intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries which others have shown
even to this day in various articles and topics  THe tongues movement in
Corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church  If it
was so in Corinth why could they not have an influence in Rome the city of
seven hills

Also you do not have to listen to his conclusions you can draw your own
conclusions by looking at the customs artifacts the cerimonial dress the
docrine of purgatory etc from the vantage of the mysteries  You don't even
have to be a believer to see the parallels  Just one example  THe mitre 
Where did it come from  Why is it shaped the way it is  What are the two
tails that hang down the back represent  Was this an ancient  head dress from
an earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the
church of the State of Rome  Does it have pagan history behind it and if so
why did the RCC chose regardless

Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions  Even the
scriptures themselves refer to it  All Hislop did was collect the information
from all the various sources and put them in one binding  There is no lack of
scholorship in that

Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation yet present no
evidence supporting it

     It bugs me when I see this kind of nonsense

     First there is no reasonable evidence linking Masonry to ancient
Egypt or even that it existed prior to the late th century and
there's nothing definitive before the th

I'm going to cut Rex's ramblings down a bit


You must not be past your th level  You should read Wilkinson's
Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British
Masonry  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a  degree black
mason  I've talked with him 
There is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of

   Rex there are literally hundreds of thousands of nd degree
Masons in this country and thousands of rds If nasty stuff was
really going on don't you think you'd have more than a couple of
disgruntled members exposing it Heck if what you say is true then
Rev Norman Vincent Peale is an Osiris worshiper
 

Long quote from someone named Hislop source not given deleted I'm
attempting to extract from it the relevent points 

   Osiris is actually Nimrod a Babylonian Deity 

   It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally
    founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis the goddessmother or
    wife of Osiris

   The Babylonian Nimrod and Osiris are both connected with the building
    trade ie with Masonry

   Nimrod as the son of Cush was a negro isn't this refering to a 
    Biblical Nimrod rather than the Babylonian god

    there was a tradition in Egypt recorded by Plutarch that 'Osiris
     was black'


     There is a long tradition in Masonry of claiming ancient lineage
for the order on the flimsiest of grounds This dates right back to
the Constitutions of  which cite Adam as the first Mason I've
seen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans Greeks and
Egyptians and Atlanteans I even have a book which claims to prove
that Stonehenge was originally a Masonic temple 

    Claims prove nothing Where's the beef Rex

Claims exMason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge
 Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard

   I'd have to check this The tomb paintings I remember don't show
this

  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show or should I say
 hide this representation  They however worshipped the spotted cow

   Can you give ancient citations for this The druids were suppressed
over  years ago What's your point

   This whole leopard skin business sounds bizarre  I have not yet
gone through the Scottish Rite which contains all of those higher
degrees antiMasons get so excited about and which was invented in
the 's but I know enough people who have and who are good
Christians that I reject your claim

I'll stand by my statements  Masonry is of the mystery religions
that all find their source in Babylon the great harlot Sorry Peter
I do not mean to be a cold slap to the face but there is to much

Not so much a 'slap in the face' as 'a weary feeling of deja vu' I'm
going through a very similar argument over on soccultureafricanamerican

evidence to the contrary that Masonry doesn't find its origins in
Egypt  Of the Masons I have personally talked to all refered to
Egypt as their origin  

    Why don't you try reading some serious books on Masonic history such
as Hamill's The Craft

Why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago
was freely admitted

   Because we got honest If you can come up with actual evidence that
Masonry existed prior to  I'd be VERY impressed actually
anything earlier than  would be pretty good

i believe that the one
important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament
passages cited above did NOT know was that there is scientific
evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly inherent
rather than completely learned

Note that scientific evidence in this area does not prove any conclusions
There has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual's
brains are different from heterosexuals but that proves very little

Also notice that the apostles did not have with them the scientific
evidence linking certain genes with alcoholism or stealing with certain
genetic problems  Even if they did have scientific evidence I doubt it
would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the Holy 
Spirit that these things are sinful

This reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine  He said 
something very true  Christianity teaches that we should not give in
to our every inclination  Most people do give in to their leanings
In Christianity we have the concept of struggling with the flesh
and bringing it into submission  One person may have a problem with
his temper and having a murderous heart another may have a problem
with homosexuality another may be inclined to greed  But God offers
us the opportunity to be more than conquerers

sources where you can find this information there is homosexual
behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals which is in itself
suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned or at least that
the word unnatural shouldn't really apply

The preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates
with him  Is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband
The Bible is concerned with human morality and only touches on animal
morality as it relates to humans

I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse

 It is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians do
raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human
adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut  If you cannot address the actual issues you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world

No  It is very relevant  Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are
topically aranged together in the law  This is very important
Anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality
deals with temple prostitution and I think you would agree that there
is no proof for this  If the Law reveals the character of God and 
is holy just and good as is written in the New Testament then
those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts
to be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture  

Why must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human
adult relationships  Isn't that bordering on sophistry  The point
we are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts
Not everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional
argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors
The issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly  

I do not have problem with a loving nonlustful relationship with a member
of the same sex  I have them and we all do  The issue at hand is 
the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex or lusting after
So other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation 

And the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships
between adult humans is red herring  We all agree that it is okay 
for adults to  have caring relationships with one another

Ok what's more important to gay Christians  Sex or Christianity

I'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious  Try rephrasing it

	What's more important to Christians  Love of God or love
	of other human beings

to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like
the other  I am deeply suspicious of any flavor of Christianity
which would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a priority
over the other such as to claim a conflict  True we are told to let
the dead bury the dead to hate family rather than let it keep us from
following Christ  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our
fellows and love of God but of allowing social constructs to blind us
to the presense of God  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God
in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different
level than the one who is so caught up in love of God

The trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex  Yes it
has sometimes been the case that the Church has taught that all sex
was nasty evil sinful stuff  But when man and wife leave their parental
homes to become helpmates living in one flesh it is the sex that is the
vehicle of becoming one flesh if you doubt me read St Paul on what
is wrong with frequenting prostitutes   Less provocatively what I
mean is just this sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social
interaction and in particular is the foundation of the institution of
marriage so that unlike with many mammals human males remain with and
foster the children they beget and support their children's mothers
This is the schema behind Genesis  and behind Jesus' citation of
that passage

	 I observe by the way that not all human males in fact do as
	  I have just described but another thing that characterizes
	  human societies is our raising of nonbegotten children not
	  only orphans and adoptees and the like but products of the
	  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses We are
	  in this not unique in the animal world but the full extent of
	  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us 

Yes of course it sometimes goes wrong  like all else we do it is
infected with sin and you find married couples where there is no bond
and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond
formation the infatuation falling in love phase that they break
any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep
unity God has prepared for us and stepping back out again right away
Satan may indeed use sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love 
but in the Edenic creation that is not its nature and with God's grace
under the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem
for Christians though we must be vigilant even in Christ as the devil
is watchful prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour

So returning to the original question what is more important to STRAIGHT
Christians  Sex or Christianity  Paul clearly tended to think that
sex was at best a distraction from Christianity though to be charitable
to him his context was in expectation of immediate parousia so that the
hard TASKS of a married union  the lifelong building and adaptation to
each other  seemed somehow to undercut the proper preparation for an
immediate eschaton  Since we do not know the hour of return we should
act both with instant readiness for that and with a commitiment to our
mates that proposes a long lifetime together  And telling people not to
bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause
of the the commandment to love  I would claim that only a very few saints
have the CAPACITY to deeply love without sexual tinges or complication
mind you their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual
life in married union growing together as one flesh  and that means in
the type case with a persistent and continued sexual relationship  We
are human and little good comes of trying to mortify the flesh to the
point of pretending to be otherwise pretending NOT to be sexual beings

Christianity I would hope  Would they be willing to forgo sex
completely in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others

It depends entirely on context  If that context is major hypocrisy
on the part of those who find us stumbling blocks I am much less of
a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins

There are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift
and maybe even a victory against a tothem troubling sexual urge that
seems to them to lead only to sin  Nothing I say should ever be read
as demeaning such a gift  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our
conspecifics and indeed for all God's creation that can develop to
the full without the tutoring of a spousalhelpmate marriage founded
in sex  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance
telling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift or else what
is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our
spiritual endowments from God  To one person is given the gift of
speaking in toungues to another intepretation of toungues to yet
another prophecy and to still another teaching  The notion that some
particular gift is required of all is one of the earliest heresies

                                                               Consequently
 this verse indicates that she was without sin  Also as was observed at
 the very top of this post Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the
 mother of Jesus who was definitely without sin

If the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give
birth to God then why didn't Mary's mother have to be without
sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus  For
that matter why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin
either  Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing
through each person the need for the last one Mary to have
none puts God in a box where we say that He couldn't have
incarnated Himself through a normal human being

My God is an all powerful God Who can do whatever suits His
purpose  This includes creating a solar system and planet earth
with the appearance of great age providing a path through the
Red Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the
existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the
right speed and direction and the birth of Himself from a normal
sinful person without being tainted by her original sin

I see far too much focus on the objects of religion and not
nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to
all believers with the Author of our existence without the
necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits
to God in the form of Mary Apostles and a Pope

 Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin ie the
 Immaculate Conception is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned
 during her lifetime which is a separate doctrine and I believe also
 held by the Catholic Church

If Mary was born without original sin and didn't sin during her
lifetime how is she any different from Jesus  This means the
world has had two perfect humans  one died to take away the sins
of the world  the other gave birth to Him  I would certainly
want to see some scriptural support for this before I would start
praying to anyone other than God  Everything I have ever read
from the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless
Lamb of God not His mother grandmother

 Hope this is useful to you

Very useful in helping me understand some of the RC beliefs
Thank you

This paragraph brought to mind a question  How do you Mormons reconcile
the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection
people will neither marry nor be given in marriage Luke chapt 
 
deletions
 
I think what Jesus is saying here and it is clearest in Matthew's
and Mark's accounts is that marriages will not be performed in the
resurrection  This goes along with our belief that if a person is
to marry at all it must be done on this earth deletions

The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this
passage is marriages that were performed on earth  Jesus' words
seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their
question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection
This being the case the most straightforward interpretation in my
opinion is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those
who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now  Other
wise why would Jesus offer but are like the angels in heaven as a
contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in
marriage  We do not have angellike natures now but someday we shall
and when we do our earthly marriages will be irrelevant  Or at least
that's what I think Jesus is saying about the postresurrection validity of 
marriages performed on earth  Your mileage may vary

       safety  To the degree that means other than the death

       because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the
       final goal of protection of peace and human dignity

Thanks for posting the exact wording which I had not seen
previously The part I quote above seems to me to indicate
disapproval of capital punishment  it is to be used only when
other means are not sufficient I would say this is a stronger
restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when
justifiable I would certainly say there are cases where a
crime justifies death perhaps this is the Old Testament
interpretation but my reverence for life would say that I
would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty a New
Testament interpretation It is a matter for debate whether
the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that
nonviolent provisions do not I don't believe it does and I
would certainly observe that in the USA where you have the
death penalty there is a far higher murder rate than here in
the UK where we do not

      Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at       
      Lourdes  She referred to herself as the Immaculate Conception
      Since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the   
      doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed   
      the case for the doctrine                                     
    Bernadette was  years old when she had her visions in     
    four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the  
    Pope

I forgot exactly what her age was but I remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education whatsoever at the age of the apparitions
She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort

She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about 
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so  
For several instances the priest did not get an answer since 
Bernadette did not receive any  One time after several apparitions
passed The Lady finally said I am the Immaculate Conception
So Bernadette was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking  So when she told the priest the
priest was shocked and asked Bernadette Do you know what
you are talking about  Bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest  The priest continued with How did you remember
this if you do not know  Bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest

The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then
But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette

Note This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims  At the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water 
flowing

Hi everyone

I'm trying to find my way to God but find it difficult as I can't hear
God talking to me letting me know that he exists and is with me and
that he knows me and I feel that I can't possibly get to know him until
he does Maybe he is talking to me but I just don't know or understand
how to listen

Some Christians tell me that in their opinion the only way to find God
is to take a plunge and commit your life to him and you will discover
This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit
frightening but I have a few questions

 How do you actually commit yourself If I just say OK God her you
go I'm committing my life to you I wouldn't really feel that he'd
listened  at least I couldn't be sure that he had So how does one or
how did you commit oneself to God

 In committing myself in this way what do I have to forfeit of my
current life What can I no longer do I feel that I'm as 'good' as many
Christians and I try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour'  I
don't go round killing people stealing etc and I try not to get
jealous of other people in any way  and I would say that I keep to the
standards of treating other people as well as many Christians So what
do I have to give up

 When committed what do I have to do What does it involve What if
any burdens am I taking on

 So then what's the general difference before and after I assume
that like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older it
won't suddenly change my life the day I commit myself So what happens

 How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do How can I find
out what the 'it' in the last sentence actually is

Thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions Perhaps
email would be a better way to reply but it's up to you

	Raised in Oakland and San Lorenzo by strict fundamentalist

Were the San Jose Mercury news to come out with an article starting with
Raised in Oakland by Mexican parents Mason was beaten my face would
be red with anger over the injustice done to my Mexican family members and


Although I'm neither Fundamentalist nor Evangelical I have often noticed
this trend in the media  In short it is permissable to bash Fundamentalists
No need to substitue a nationality such as Mexican try simply to 
substitute a different religion raised by Muslim parents or raised
by Jewish parents  The paper simply would not do this

I have noticed that newspapers don't even know what a fundamentalist is
at the least they confuse new evangelicals and fundamentalists  In this
news group the liberals don't even know what a fundamentalist is crying
out legalist at anyone who believes and obeys God's Word A fundamentalist
would train their children in the way God proscribes not in the way that
man proscribes  This would not include life threatening beatings but would
include corporal punishment 

To the liberals I cry out infidel at anyone who does not believe God's Word

Signature follows
Your statutes are wonderful therefore I obey them  Psalm 

David L Hanson
Any opinions expressed are my own

As most people here know I believe fundamentalist is sufficiently
illdefined that I advise using some more specific term  I think many
people use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of
related concepts eg denial of evolution  While the original
fundamentals movement was somewhat more specific I would think most
people who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original
agenda  It included a list of key traditional doctrines eg  the
virgin birth  The term is now being used by the press to describe
aggressive conservative religions in general most typically those who
are attempting to legislate religion

Legalism is yet another illdefined term  However there is some
reason for its use in this context  In fact the common theological
definition is the believe that salvation is through the Law  I hope
no one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this
view  However there is a basic difference in approach over what we
expect to get out of the Bible  The conservative approach expects to
find specific behavioral rules  Generally the posters advocating this
approach talk about the relevant passages from Paul's letter as God's
Law  The liberal approach expects to find general principles but it
regards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the
culture and other things  It's easy to see why a liberal would regard
the conservative approach as legalism  It's hard to know quite what
other term to use  The issue in this case is not inerrancy because
no one is saying that Paul made a factual error  Rather the question
is whether his statements are to be taken as Law  Calling the
positive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology  I haven't
seen any good alternative

We are all still human We don't know it all but homosexual or heterosexual 
we all strive to follow Jesus  The world is dying and needs to hear about 
Jesus Christ 
 Gaining entry into heaven cannot be done without first being cleansed by 
 the blood of Jesus 
 Sin cannot dwell in heaven  It is against the natural laws of God 
 Being converted to christianity means being baptized by the Holy Spirit 
 You cannot get to heaven by good works only 
 Because of the union with the holy spirit the man's behavior will change 
 If there is true union he will not desire to be homosexual  Fornication 
 and homosexuality will leave your life if you are truly baptized by the 
 holy spirit  It's not to say that we don't stumble now and then

In that case being undamaged by Original Sin Mary is more fully human

   You ask why God cannot repeat the miracle of Mary's preservation
from Original Sin  A better way to phrase it would be why did He
not do it that way but you misunderstand how Mary's salvation was
obtained  Like ours the Blessed Virgin Mary's salvation was obtained
through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross  However as
God is not bound by time which is His creation God is free to apply
His Sacrifice to anyone at any time even if that person lived before
Christ came to Earth from our timebound perspective  Therefore
Christ's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose and
were necessary even for Mary's salvation

If you don't agree with Joseph's accurate statement of the Catholic dogma
of Mary's perpetual sinlessness then how do you interpret Luke 

	And when the angel had come to her he said Hail full of 
	grace the Lord is with thee  Blessed art thou among women

and Luke  

	for behold henceforth all generations shall call me blessed

I suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary was
possessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace just as some of 
us are but it seems to me that full of grace means just what it says   
filled to the brim incapable of containing more  The only other people we 
know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now 
another Catholic dogma based on the communion of saints as I explained in 
an earlier post  Full of grace to me means sinless and anyone who has 
ever sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as Mary  
was sinless  

As a Catholic I too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace  But
that's where the Catholic faith and prayer come into play  I pray God
to strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ
which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His Church  And
as you probably know faith in Christ's Church is tantamount to faith in
Christ inasmuch as the Church is Christ's Mystical Body  A Catholic by
nature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ  a personal faith in 
Christ as his own personal redeemer and  a community faith in the Church 
as the body of Christ

You might want to check the Greek  full of grace translates a
single word that simply means favored or perhaps more literally
graced  The full is a vestige of the specific translation you're

In article Maygenevarutgersedu revdaknetcomcom D Andrew Kille writes
poramihlpbattcom wrote
 Lets talk about principles If we accept that God sets the
 standards for what ought to be included in Scripture  then we
 can ask
  Is it authoritative

Authoritative is not a quality of the writing itself it is a statement
by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative

Arguably it is both Since authority is a matter of both
communicator and recepiant we can say that for example Jesus
is Lord whether the world at large accepts the authority or
not Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative
content whether or not it is accepted This issue is at the
heart of Pilate's pragmatic question What is truth to Jesus
when our Lord was brought before Him Jesus' reply was to appeal
to the authority of his Father
You also might like to consider the claimed authority
represented by the statements thus says the Lord in the Bible
which claim to put across the exact words of God

You fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of
inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the community
of faith  does something become truth because it is accepted
The main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward
direction as well as a manward which is where the reference to
Rev  came in

  Is it prophetic

How is prophecy to be defined If it is speaking forth of God's message
much of the apocrypha must surely qualify

If we narrowed it down to the predictive elements  which will
cut out some of the  accepted OT books as well  we
nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the
book Jesus' standards were that Scripture cannot be broken
Can you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha
ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written

  Is it authentic

Again by what standard  Is authenticity a function of the authors the
historical accuracy 

Does it have a subjective 'ring of truth' about it  and does
other evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the
authenticity archaeological other textual evidence for
example

  Is it dynamic

What is this supposed to mean  Many of the apocryphal books are highly
dynamic thought provoking faithful even exciting

What this is getting at is the relationship between text and
reader It is to do with the quality of writing which should
have the ability to fire the mind affect our thought life and
cause us to act in a certain way  there is something of this
in Jesus' quote Man does not live by bread alone but by every
word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord Matt 

  Is it received collected read and used

By whom  Of course the apocryphal books were received by some
collected or else we would not have them read and used and they still are
in the Catholic and Orthodox churches

Does the Catholic Church give the same authority to the
Apocrapha as to the accepted  books Certainly it is not as
widely used as the OT and NT

 On these counts the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God

This is demonstrably false

Think about what I have said above You may want to revise your
conclusion In addition think about other 'sacred writings' eg
the Koran the book of Mormon and how and why you would
categorise them using the above principles One word of caution
 you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books in
that the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the Bible
Remember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel
of light and quoting Scripture

 To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha
  They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
 anachronisms

So do other books of the Bible

What were you thinking of

deletions

 How do you then view the words I warn everyone who  hears the
 words of the prophecy of this book If anyone adds anything to
 them God will add to him the plagues described in this book
 And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy God will
 take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
 holy city Rev 
 Surely this sets the standard and not just manmade traditions

These words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone
not to the whole body of scripture  Revelation itself was accepted very
late into the canon  The church simply did not see it as having a primary
role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture

We've lost the point and the context here I am not arguing that
the statement in Rev can be applied indescriminately just that
the whole acceptancerejection idea does not just follow on from
manmade traditions  but there is I believe an act of God
involved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as
Scripture and comes under the definition of Tim

      Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at       
      Lourdes  She referred to herself as the Immaculate Conception
      Since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the   
      doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed   
      the case for the doctrine                                     
    Bernadette was  years old when she had her visions in     
    four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the  
    Pope

I forgot exactly what her age was but I remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education whatsoever at the age of the apparitions
She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in a prison cell of some sort

She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about 
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so  
For several instances the priest did not get an answer since 
Bernadette did not receive any  One time after several apparitions
passed The Lady finally said I am the Immaculate Conception
So Bernadette was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking  So when she told the priest the
priest was shocked and asked Bernadette Do you know what
you are talking about  Bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest  The priest continued with How did you remember
this if you do not know  Bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest

The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then
But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette

Note This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims  At the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water 
flowing

The phrase is eulogemene su en gunaixin blessed are you among women
There is nothing to indicate that this is an exceptional or unique status
only that as a woman Mary was blessed  Adding the word all is not
a fair reading of the text  There are some good reasons for the church's

The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure a nun of the
sisters of Charity on July   at Rue du Bac Paris

Sister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy age 
or  who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light 
The child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised
the Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her Our Lady appeared to
her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining
to her life and to the future of France and the world

On November  Our Lady appeared again to Catherine She instructed
her to have a medal struck She told her that those who wore this 
medal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would
receive great graces In less than a year there were three more
apparitions In June of  the medals were a reality Many reports
were received by those who wore it Within two years of its issuing
the medal was known as the Miraculous Medal Catherine died in 
Her body to this day is remarkably preserved incorrupt She was
canonized on July   Her body lies in the chapel at the
motherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with
Our Lady

The apparition on November   was of average height and clothed
in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor
Above the altar a pyramid painted to represent God's all knowing
wisdom looked down on them Our Lady's feet rested on a white globe
and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was
stepping on In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world
Great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed 
Catherine an image of two hearts the Sacred Heart wrapped in
piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword The sword
represented her suffering with Jesus

The apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned
that a dark era lay in the immediate future It was the apparition 
leading up to the recent ones Our Lady began to dispense secrets
And with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute
with the forces of the dark She told Catherine The times are
evil Misfortunes will fall upon France The throne will be
overturned The entire world will be overcome by evils of all
kinds

Refer to books on St Catherine for more of Our Lady's messages
A copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores

I will post other Marian events every few days or so including
the ones happening today which are still under investigation
These postings serve only to introduce you to these events
Please look more into them and understand the reason for 
the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions

It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support
the doctrine of Original Sin  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine with no
other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism 
If you read all of Ezekiel  you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty
for anyone else's sins  So we can have no original guilt from Adam

  This neatly eliminates the need for a savior and proves that we can be
saved by works alone  If we have no original sin then it is possible for
us to save ourselves by not sinning  I understand the reasoning behind your
argument but it leads to sheer folly  Original sin is the reason we need
faith to be saved

Eugen Bigelow writes

It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude He had no
argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon John
 and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus 
that in the law prophets and psalms which referred to him  the 
OT division of Scripture Luke  as well as in Luke 
taking Genesis to Chronicles the jewish order  we would say
Genesis to Malachi as Scripture

You should remember that in Adam's transgression all men and women
sinned as Paul wrote  All of humanity cooperativley reblled against
God in Adma's sin thus all are subject to it and the sin is
transmitted from generation to generation

Bruce Webster writes
Indeed LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly cf DC  note that this
passage applies it only to members of the LDS church

I include the key verse DC  because others
may not have the reference

And again inasmuch as parents have children in Zion
or in any of her stakes which are organized that teach
them not to understand the doctrine of repentance
faith in Christ the Son of the living God and of
baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying
on of the hands when eight years old the sin be
upon the heads of the parents

What is the sin of the parents

Hi Bruce  How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 
Ezekiel  The soul who sins is the one who will die  The son will not
share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the
son  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and
the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him

Is Ezekiel  not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps

Ezekiel  teaches a correct principle
However it assumes that fathers and sons have 
equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment

Parents are responsible to teach their children
the Gospel and other life skills  Should they
fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their 
children the parent would be held responsible
 not for their children's sins but for not
teaching them properly

Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position 
of authority in either the family or the church He
expects that person to teach those in his charge

In Ezekiel  someone called to care for others 
is likened to a watchman unto the house of Israel
If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from 
his way that man shall die in his iniquity but
his blood will I require at thine hand
Nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to 
turn from it if he do not turn from his way he
shall die in his iniquity but thou hast
delivered thy soul

Even though the DC prefaces this commandment with
parents have children in Zion I believe all
parents are responsible for teaching their children 
whatever good principles they understand
However LDS parents accept greater responsbility
and could be judged more strictly

When Elizabeth greeted Mary Elizabeth said something to the effect that
Mary out of all women was blessed  If so it appears that this
exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity

I don't see how this logically follows  True enough Mary received a blessing
beyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be 
the mother of the Savior  It says nothing about Mary needing to be a blessed 
person first in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the Son of 
God  Again I think the problem is that as humans we can't comprehend how the 
sinless Incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and God's Spirit
Rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of God we must needs try
to dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be  Mary's own
words 

my spirit rejoices in God my Savior for he has regarded the low
 estate of his handmaiden

sound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity in need of a 
Savior similar to what David proclaimed in his psalmsnot the words
of a holy being with no further need for God's grace

I really apologize for harping on this I don't suppose it's important
It's just that I see Mary and Joseph and the Baby reduced to placid
serene figurines I feel we lose the wonder in the fact that God chose
to come down to you and I to be born of people like you and I to share
our existence and redeem us from it's fallenness by his holy Incarnation

			    Conviction of Sin

		A metaexegetical or methodological essay


In article Mayathosrutgersedu
REXLEXfnalfnalgov writes

I can't post it all at once so it will come piece meal and not daily

I look forward to reading it  When I got to the library last week it
was with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared
over the last few years since my previous look at the literature  Un
fortunately they had moved the journal backissues so I didn't get a
look at the articles I was hoping to find  I will continue to reserve
my own judgment on arsenokoitai until I have seen the latest scholarly
work and I can hope that REXLEX's posting may give some meat to chew on

However what I can do now is to point out the methodological issues
 what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter
If the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues so much the better
if not you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard

                 James B DeYoung

writes in abstractu

this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai deriving it
from the LXX of Lev  cf  and using it for homosexual
orientation and behavior

	it is only a minor point but let me make it anyway De Young has
	already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that
	the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and
	NOT with orientation  I doubt this will have much bearing on the
	article as such but thought I should point it out from the start

The hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a coined the word and
b his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law  The
questions I wish to raise are

	  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis
and	  what follows if one accepts or stipulates for the sake of the
	     discussion that it is correct

Note that b is independent of a I consider b far more plausible than a
which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the
literature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word  So far as I know
Paul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters  Unless
you have an otherwiseestablished pattern of coinages it is not sound
methodology to assume it  particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi
ate text to fix the coinage's meaning for his audience

As yet the extract presents no evidence at all  What do we need to confirm
or reject the hypothesis which I should say at the outset I find somewhat
plausible I certainly know of nothing which makes it an impossible way
of construing this problem passage  I'm going to set aside for the moment
the question of whether Paul might have coined this usage to look at the
more tractable question of what it means  For this there are in principle
two kinds of evidence that can be adduced internal and external  That is
we can look at the text of Paul's letter for clarification or look outside
that to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on or to
derivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul's meaning

The single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no
internal evidence for Paul's meaning  He uses the word totally without an
explanation or hint as to his meaning save that its inclusion in a list of
negatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning

We are left as the only internal clue with the etymology or formation
of the word  which is indeed the reason that De Young and others before
him have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with
other men where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex lie in
Leviticus bed in Greek  One problem is that bedders koitai is
not as far as I know USED that way in Greek  THEREFORE I offer one
serious test which de Young's hypothesis must pass or be rejected

	o  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul or not much
	   prior to his day such that the Xkoitai formation implies
	   men who have sex with X  obviously the best case is to
	   find such usages of arsenokoitai itself

such texts would be confirmation that the word can be read that way
It is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under
standable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition
of the roots  Existence of such parallels doesn't prove the hypothesis
correct  but it goes a long way towards making such a usage whether or
not original with Paul in the specific case of X  arsen possible
of comprehension by his readers

My test moves in the direction of external evidence  If Paul does NOT
in his text explain his word and he does not then he has to expect his
readers to already know the word which stands against its being a coinage
or to expect that it mimics word formations that they do know such that
they can guess his meaning without too much floundering

External evidence that is texts other than Paul's own and lexicographic
or socialhistorical considerations that might be adduced then come into
the picture  If there are other uses of the word not dependent on Paul
which have sufficient internal contextual evidence  or some gloss by
a contemporary scribe  to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu
ality or similar koitai formations used in similar ways then one
has grounds for

	o  denying that Paul coined the word
and	o  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning

Do you see the problem  If Paul coined the word then he REQUIRES his
readers to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and
its intent  in this case that they would stipulating De Young's guess
understand him to be referring to the Levitical universal prohibition
of malemale sex this mind you in a context where Paul has emphasized
at least to OTHER congregations and so one assumes to the Corinthians 
how else to explain  Cor  and the Corinthians having to be pulled
back from overinterpreting their freedom the NON applicability of Torah
law to his gentile converts

Among the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined
the word its first element is archaic  arsen is an old Attic or
Ionic form of what in even classical let alone koine times would be
assimilated as arren  To me this implies that we are even more than
usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage  What
is Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation

And if he didn't coin the word but picked it up like the others in
his list as common terms of derogation then his meaning will be  for
his readers  constrained by that common meaning since he gives no
other

I cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by
this word  We and his original readers are guessing  They at least
had a contemporary context  and maybe Paul had used this very word and
explained it in great detail to them in person  But we have no trace of
evidence of that and to suppose it is mere fantasy

So  we are desperately in need of external evidence about this word
And it seems to be exceptionally meagre  That is precisely the problem
I can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about
the word

	a  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for some or all maybe
	    very specific maybe very general homosexual male activities

	b  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual
	    Greeks which may or may not be consciously associated on their
	    part with the Leviticus passage

	c  Paul invented the term  and again there may or may not be an
	    association with Leviticus in his doing so  He may or may not
	    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application
	    with absolute and clear boundaries  Since none of his OTHER
	    words in that list have such character this last seems to me
	    about the least plausible of the hypotheses I'm advancing

Of these I'd say off the top of my head that a is most plausible  but
I still have reservations about that too

If the word NEVER appears before Paul and in later uses has some evidence
of depending on Paul then one can opt for Paul's coining it  If it does
appear before him he might still have coined it being unaware of prior
use in which case his coinage is inherently confusing but one should
normally demote c on the basis of any earlier uses especially if they
can be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled  In
either of the a or b cases one has to take into account Paul's relation
to the community of usage he picked the word up from  and whether it be
from the Greek or Jewish communities Paul's relations are hardly straight
forward

There is so far as I have yet seen little or no external evidence to aid
us in selecting one of these or some other hypothesis  Your guess is as
good as mine or maybe worse or maybe better depending on a lot of things
But it remains  so far  guesswork  And I don't know about you but I
for one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God  By all means
be convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at  as he
says elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this
same character Romans 

	Hold on to your own belief as between yourself and God  and
	consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going
	against his conscience  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt
	is condemned because he is not in good faith and every act done
	in bad faith is a sin

For my part I cannot see any way to resolve Paul's meaning in the use of
arsenokoitai without directly applicable external evidence  and by
the nature of such external evidence it will never reach to certainty
of constraining Paul's own intent  Paul like Humpty Dumpty and me and
all the rest of us will use words in ways that are personal choices 
and sometimes leave his readers puzzled  If that puzzlement leads you
to God it may be blessed  if it should lead away as some of Paul's
words HAVE led some people then Paul's intense communicative effort to
contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences
I have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide  if I
read him in the large if I can see him lay out his position in detail
and hammer it home time and time again  I am much less certain about his
meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages such as this one

In my usual discursive way I have gone on at great length about the first
of my intended metaexegetical points  what would be needed to confirm
that Paul a coined or b in any case meant the word to mean the same as
the Leviticus prohibition  My second point is to stipulate this hypo
thesis and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and
for later Christians  Given my verbosity this will be tomorrow night's
meditation

 Do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers 
nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards 
nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom  of God  And such were 
some of you  I Cor 

The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia
in this  I think we can all agree with Paul that there are SOME kinds of
activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or
reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation  We may
or may not agree to the bounds of those categories however and the very
fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at
all clear but that Paul  an excellent rhetorician  had no interest
in MAKING them clear leaving matters rather to our Spiritled decisions
with all the uncomfortable livingwithotherreadings that has dominated
Christian discussion of ALL these areas


What is fornication sex outside of marriage abuse of sex  

Is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage
Isn't it an unatural use of what God has given us

Why is it that homosexuals are using the Grace of God as a license to
practice sin 

   For certain persons have crept in unnoticed those who were long
   beforehand marked out for this condemnation ungodly persons who
   turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only 
   Master and Lord Jesus Christ

                                      Jude  NASB

What is defined by God as a legitimate marriage

   For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother and
   shall cleave to his wife and the shall become one flesh

                                      Gen  NASB

   And He answer and said Have you not read that He who created them
   from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE and said 'FOR THIS 
   CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE
   AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'  Consequently they are no longer
   two but one flesh  What therefore God has joined together let no
   man separate 

                                      Matt  NASB

   But because of immoralities let each man have his own wife and let
   each woman have her own husband  Let the husband fulfill his duty
   to his wife and likewise also the wife to her husband

                                       Corinthians  NASB

  There are plenty of
laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus most of
which Christians ignore completely  They never even BOTHER to examine
them  They just assume that they know which ones are moral and
which ones are ritual  Well I have news for you  Any anthropology
course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categories
in an awful lot of societies we have them too but buried pretty deep
And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus
from the ritual law which NO Christian I know feels applies to us

I disagree Every law that is written in Leviticus should be looked at 
as sin  That is why we have a need for a savior  I can understand 
someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the Levitcal law but
I would hope that they would repent when confronted with it

I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse

Well latida  So what  This is almost as slimey an argument as the
one that homosexuality  rape  I know of no one who argues seriously
though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality  It is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians do
raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human
adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut  If you cannot address the actual issues you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world  If you want to address bestiality that is YOUR business not
mine  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in
our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing
us as human beings  You want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means
you can think of to do so

Also I noticed that the preceeding verses say  

   Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her
   menstrual impurity  And you shall not have intercourse with your
   neighbors wife to be defiled with her 


                                   Leviticus   NASB

These verses are just as relevant as

   You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an
   abomination

                                   Leviticus  NASB

Why was God telling the Israelites not to practice such things

   Do not defile yourselves by any of these things for by all these
   the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled
   For the land has become defiled therefore I have visited its 
   punishment upon it so the land has spewed out its inhabitants
   But as for you you are to keep My statutes and Judgments and 
   shall not do any of these abominations neither the native nor
   the alien who sojourns among you

                                    Leviticus  NASB

He is the Lord  Listen to what he has to say 

Nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals  We do love you but we don't 
agree that what you practice is not sin  You have not truly repented
of your sin  We hate the sin that is within your lives  I hate sin
that is in my life  All Christians should hate the sin that is within
their own lives  Confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance 
Yes I agree with John  but I also know that Jesus said Repent for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand  Matt   If you don't agree that
homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it  This means that
you remain in bondage to it  Repent from it and God will set you free

In His Love

The last time we discussed homosexuality I asked whether anyone could
identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible
prohibited but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent
harm to anyone Put another way the question is whether homosexual
intercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe
is immoral solely on the basis that God says it is with no insight
being offered as to why it is immoral No one could answer my
question in either form from the Bible I did get an interesting
response based on Roman Catholic theology

However I think now that I can at least answer my first question
Link Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping
with one's aunt Incest is held to be immoral in every society
that is there are some degrees of relationship where marriage
and thus intercouse is prohibited The Bible is no exception
The trouble is that it may be difficult to see why a particular
relationship qualifies as incestuous Societies differ as to
how they define incest Genetic reasons are sometimes offered but
all the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way Why can't
a man sleep with his step motherassuming that his father is
dead and that he has married her How does this case differ
from the duty to marry one's brother's childless wife

Are these two cases parallel Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous
marriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason perhaps
that God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable
of understanding why

PS Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe
as some did last time My mind is not made up on these questions
You don't know whether I am homophobic or not You don't
know me To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the
person may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic
remarks

Peter White writes
Luke  talks about the rich man and Lazarus Matthew  talks about 
the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels Revelations
 and  reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are
thrown Matthew  talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and
the fire of hell It seems quite clear that there is this place where
a fire burns forever From the Revelations passages it is clear that
the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever From the
Matthew  passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the
punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or
in the sense of continual 

You've missed on very important passage

 Thess 
 For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who
afflict you and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when
the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming
fire dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do
not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus And these will pay the penalty of
eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of
His power when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day and to be
marveled at among all who have believed for our testimony to you was
believed

Things to note from this passage  Unbelievers are both those who openly reject
the gospel and those who do not know God  The eternal destruction is the same
as the eternal hope in   This distructions primarily emphasize that it is
separation from the presence of God  THe context is speaking of the nd advent
while  is speaking of the rapture  Don't confuse the two 

In the Bible I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of
hell beyond the general of hot unpleasant and torment

Yet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven

 For instance
it is not discussed how if at all the rich man can
continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or
whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is
burned up If you can forgive the graphicalness if you throw a
physical body into a fire assuming the person starts out alive
at some fairly quick point the nerves are destroyed and pain is
no longer sensed 

If this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to
ignite
However there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning
bush that was not consumed  Also the Daniel acct shows that the laws of
nature can be interupted even with earthly fire

It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement
the unbelievers who are already physically dead are cast into hell

Maybe you don't understand  There will be those who are alive at the end of
the millenium who will walk straight into the GWTJ  Even those who have died
in their sin will be resurrected ie reunited with their physical body to
receive condemnation

ie they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical pain

This is contrary to the teaching of Scripture

 What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are
to be forever without God 
 
The Lazarusrich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener
think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people
won't listen to God even after he rises from the dead 

THis is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the no physical
body thesis

The point of
the parable is to reach the hardhearted here who are not listening
to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ
It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is
not even remotely pleasant

The true awlfulness of hell is that it is eternal separation from God after
having seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ  But whether it was open
rebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known
GOd not saught Him as He is then as Paul says they are without excuss and
that every mouth will be stopped  There will be no defense at the judgment
seat of God THerefore we understand it is appointed unto man once to die and
then comes judgment literally  

just because it is horrific doesn't make it less of a reality  
it should compel those of us who have the riches of Christ to share it with
others

I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus  
If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature then
those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem


Though this will be addressed in the series of articles I'm posting now under
ARESNOKOITIA I can't wait  This just really blew my socks off  Read I Tim
   Verses  speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of
the Mosaic Law  In vv we have IN ORDER the th thru the th
commandments and in the midst of this listing is homosexuals  The decalogue
above everything else is seen as God's absolute  If you don't believe in
absolutes then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT which Paul
reveals to be the Messiah of the NT Lord Christ Jesus transliterates to read
Jehovah's Anointed Savior  
  In I Cor we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan
gentiles as we do in Lev   In I Cor  only one notation drunkards
is not found in Lev   Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX  He knew
full well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT for
application in the NT  As I've said the Law was fulfilled not done away
with

of questions we are trying to deal with  He encountered homosexuality
only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was
wrong  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act
straight and fail and he had never faced Christians who are trying
to define a Christian homosexuality which fits with general Christian
ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the
relationship between God and man  It is unfair to take Paul's
judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make
judgements on these questions

This understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being
posted  Please refer to it


One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument
is because Paul probably did face this and other problems 

We can do better than probably which is not an adequate defense against the
statement that Paul's culture didn't have the same understanding of
homosexuality as ours  
Again read the article because it uses facts

I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is
not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one

I don't see how you come to that conclusion

I think I do because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of
working with AIDs patients  The pastoral is merely the practical application
of the theological truth however  Those who are working thru the issue of
homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who
is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend
yet you continue to witness to him  But once the choice is made and there is
no remorse then I feel that Paul's pastoral care as presented in the
Corinthian Church come to bear significance  THe one in active rebellion
should be placed outside of the church if a believer and if a nonbeliever
then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand  If there was a member
in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls you wouldn't
hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly  That in part betrays
the present political correctness of the issue  Pederasty is not accepted at
the present but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is
politically correct while the former is not at least not yet  THis is how
the morals decay  

I guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of
economics  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal yet in their own
states when they try to get businesses to settle there they give tax
incentives to these same richies  It comes down to a moral code of
relativeness or to use the cultural thing politically correct at the moment
Rex

You might want to look over  Tim  again  If this is really the
th through th commandments we seem to be missing thieves and
homosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery  This is of course
possible if arsenokoitia has a narrower meaning than homosexuality
in general but I think that's not your thesis  I have no objection
per se to the idea that the author of  Tim might have quoted the 
commandments but  through  minus one and plus a few things begins
to look a bit marginal  clh

Jesus Only and Oneness tend to refer to groups that do deny the
trinity    
They explain Matthew by saying that Jesus is the name of the Father Jesus
is the name of the Son and Jesus is the name of the name of the Holy
Spirit Father Son  Holy Spirit referring to different roles all
filled by Jesus 
 
IMHO this are going from bad to worse in in was bad enough
 
I do not like a God who prays to Himself  I refuse to believe Jesus prayed
to Himself     let's get real if the scriptures say He prayed to the
Father then the Father IS someone different than the Son  I have no
problems with multiple Gods  To me the whole context of the scriptures
says  Be perfect even as your Father Who is in Heaven that we can be
coheirs with Christ that we will be like Him
 
Coheirs share all things equallyincluding knowledge power dominion etc
When I am like Him Christ I will be the same as HE isand He is a God
 
If God cannot do this the His is not all powerfuland He is NOT God
If He will not He is a Liarand He is NOT God
 
But if He does He is the greatest of all the Gods
 

I don't know of anyone who says that Jesus prayed to himself  The
whole point of the Trinity is that there's enough of a distinction
within God that relationship is possible  This implies some sort of
communication  I assume that in their native form the Father and
Son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn't
involved  But Jesus is the incarnation of the Son ie  the Logos
made flesh  When he's in a human form his human actions are limited
to human capabilities  So communication with the Father takes the
form of prayer  I don't see that there's anything problematical about
that  It seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation

Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth 

Yes but no more than he is worth   Seriously Jerome is merely
and grandly another Christian witness to be taken for what he can
tell us  He is one in the community of saints  You seem to wish for
a greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant
thought than seems to me from a historical perspective to be valid
To be sure Rome rejects some significant aspects of Protestant
thought just as vehemently as Protestants reject some significant
aspects of Roman thought  Other than some peoplw who apparently try
to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection on either side there
is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume

Ecumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans as well as 
those between Rome and the Anglican communion to which I belong show
very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological
issues  the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity
Thus for example as you go on to say

                                                        They should
remeber that after the Decree of Pope St Damsus I

Many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary as
opposed to political significance  Sometimes it will sometimes it
won't  You misread me if you think that my communion at least throws
out the deuterocanonical books  Nor do I think you should overstress
the sense in which the more Reformed may do so

Again why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the
unbelieving Jews drawn up in Jamnia in  AD in countering the
Christian use of the Septuagint                 

I seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here  It verges on
and could be taken as antiSemitic in the worst sense  The unbelieving
Jews were according to what I understand as a Christian the chosen
people of God and the recipients of His preIncarnational revelation
I think they have some say in the matter  The Javneh meeting should not
be overinterpreted  A recent magisterial study titled Mikra I don't
have more citation information on hand sorry produced primarily from
the background of Christian rather than specifically Jewish scholarship
suggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering
question where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis
of the scrolls that were kept in the Temple and thereby made the hands
unclean when used  The list of sacred books that may be drawn up from
Josephus and other preYavneh sources correspond plus or minus one book
if I rememeber the chapter correctly to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh

All of this is not to throw out the deuterocanonicals what by the way
is YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not 
 just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment
does not do it justice

Homosexual Christians have indeed checked out these verses  Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations
Others simply do not address the issues
 
I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues 
 
There are exactly ZERO verses that clearly address the issues

I agree that there are no verses that have gone unchallenged by gay rights 
activists  But if there are zero verses that 'clearly' address the issues 
doesn't that mean that there are also no verses that clearly support your 
case  Are you sure you want to say that there are zero verses that clearly 
address the issues

however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly 
perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality
 
The kind of interpretation I see as incredibly perverse is that applied
to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual
behavior and rape  Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context
should be presumed to have at least READ the story it amounts to slander
 a charge that homosexuality  rape  to use that against us

The story in Genesis  tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity 
to know the two men who were Lot's guests the fact that the Sodomites became 
angry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they 
were interested only in homosexual intercourse  Yes what they wanted was 
rape homosexual rape and everybody agrees that that is wrong  Some 
Christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as 
sinful as the rape aspect of their desire  The passage does not say what it 
was that so offended God whether it was the homosexuality or the intended 
rape or both but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible 
alternatives in the light of related Scriptures  I do not believe that those 
who believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying 
to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape

You seems to take the view that the only sin described in Gen  is in the 
fact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape and that it is unfair to 
stigmatize their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape  I can 
see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion 
that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality but then again we're not 
supposed to start from our conclusions because that's circular reasoning  If 
God is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general then the more 
probably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites' 
blatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape  Later on I 
will document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises 
any homosexual intercourse even if both partners are consenting adults

 Do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers 
nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor 
drunkards 
nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom  of God  And such 
were 
some of you  I Cor 
 
The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia
in this  

The moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church 
as the proper  authority for determining what kinds of marriages would be 
legitimate and thus the church's refusal to recognize perverted marriages 
was circular reasoning  My questions however had nothing to do with the 
church ordaining new kinds of marriages and so his argument was something of a 
straw man  In terms of my original question the precise 
definitiontranslation of porneia isn't really important unless you are 
trying to argue that the Bible doesn't really condemn extramarital sex  I'm 
not sure the moderator was trying to do that

In any case I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here  
When Jesus was asked about divorce He replied Have you not read that He who 
created them from the beginning made them male and female and said 'For this 
cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and 
the two shall become one flesh'  Consequently they are no longer two but one 
flesh  What therefore God has joined together let no man separate Mt 
  I read here that the sexual union of a man male and his wife 
female is a divinelyordained union  In other words the institution of 
heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by Godnot by men 
and not by the church but by God  Men are not supposed to dissolve this 
union in Jesus' words because it is not something created by men

This is not circular reasoning this is just reading God's word  I read in the 
Bible that God ordained the union of male and female  I do not read of any 
similar divinelyordained union of two males or two females  Granted there 
have been uninspired men who have ordained alternative unions isn't Caligula 
reported to have married his horse but the only union that Jesus refers to 
as what God has joined together is the heterosexual union of a man and his 
wife

Pardon me for mentioning Caligula  I know that's probably inflammatory and I 
should save it for the discussion on bestiality in part  of this post  
Please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of 
my reply

Anyway my original question was not whether we should translate porneia in a 
way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex my question was 
given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as 
divinelyordained and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of 
marriage is homosexual intercourse sinful  Of course I see now that first we 
need to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage  You 
seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex and 
other sins are really wrong

I think we can all agree with Paul that there are SOME kinds of
activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or
reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation  We may
or may not agree to the bounds of those categories however and the very
fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at
all clear but that Paul  an excellent rhetorician  had no interest
in MAKING them clear leaving matters rather to our Spiritled decisions
with all the uncomfortable livingwithotherreadings that has dominated
Christian discussion of ALL these areas

Alternatively it may be that the definition of such terms as porneia and all 
the rest was in Paul's day what we would call a FAQ ie the Law as the 
tutor appointed by God to lead us to Christ had just spent some sixteen 
centuries drumming into the heads of God's people the idea that things like 
homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death  
Perhaps Paul didn't go into detail on what porneia c were because after  
years he considered the question to have been dealt with already  Perhaps the 
reason God's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining 
a distinct New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any 
significant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law  
I'll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below but I just 
wanted to point out that the New Testament's failure to develop a detailed new 
standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about 
sexual conductespecially after  years of putting people to death for 
practicing homosexuality

Homosexual behavior is no different  I and the other gay Christians I
know are adamant in condemning rape  heterosexual or homosexual  and
child molestation  heterosexual or homosexual  and even the possibly
harmless but obsessive kinds of sex  heterosexual or homosexual 
that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter
you cite may I mildly suggest that what Paul does in his letter that
you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning
 
        'I am free to do anything' you say  Yes but not everything
        is for my good  No doubt I am free to do anything but I for one
        will not let anything make free with me   Cor 
 
Which is a restatement that we must have no other god before God  A
commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break  Some
people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior
It is just as wrong though slightly less incendiary so it's a secondary
argument from the 'phobic contingent to equate homosexuality with such
behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers

And how do you define an obsessively driven mode of sexual behavior  How do 
you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex 
drives  Is the desire to have sinful sex an obsessively driven mode of 
behavior  I think you see that this is circular reasoning  Why is it defined 
as sinful  Because it is obsessive  What makes it obsessive  The fact that 
the person is driven to seek it even though it's sinful  Or is it obsessive 
because it is a desire for that which society condemns  Once again that's 
circular  Why is it defined as obsessive  Because the person wants it even 
though society condemns it  Why does society condemn it  Because it is 
obsessive

You seem to be trying to limit the Bible's condemnation of porneia to only 
perverted sex acts but I don't think you can really define perverted 
without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of  What 
then is Paul condemning when he declares that Fornicatorsshall not enter 
the kindgom of heaven

I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus except very tangentially
Fundamentally you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your
assumption that you know what porneia means

I think you misunderstood me  I was not trying to make an argument on some 
technical definition of porneia I was raising the issues of the sinfulness 
of extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual 
counterpart to the divinelyordained union of heterosexual couples

There are plenty of
laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus most of
which Christians ignore completely  They never even BOTHER to examine
them  They just assume that they know which ones are moral and
which ones are ritual  Well I have news for you  Any anthropology
course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categories
in an awful lot of societies we have them too but buried pretty deep
And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus
from the ritual law which NO Christian I know feels applies to us
 
I'm dead serious here  When people start going on as they do in this
matter about how repulsive and unnatural our acts are  and what
do they know about it huh  it is a solid clue to the same sort of
arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating
insects

Please remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality in part 


On what basis other than assuming your conclusion can you
say that the law against malemale intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part
of the ritual law

I am glad you asked  Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual 
intercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses then this 
would show that God's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual 
law  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual 
behavior of people who were not under the Law of Moses would you agree that 
God's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to 
just the ritual law and those who are under the Law

I've been having a private Email discussion with a th Day Adventist on the 
subject of the Sabbath and my main point against a Christian sabbathkeeping 
requirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to 
rest on the sabbath nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on 
the Sabbath  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements 
such as Thou shalt not kill and requirements that are merely part of the 
temporary Jewsonly Law of Moses such as the Sabbath

The point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of 
homosexual intercourse as an abomination is just a part of the temporary 
Jewsonly Law of Moses  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by 
God as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews and that He punished those 
guilty of this behavior by death or exile  Here's why

Back in Genesis  God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in 
the possession of the Amoritekinda hard on the Amorite don't you think  
But in verse  we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds  
it seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while because the 
iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete

Remember this is all long before there was a ritual law  What then was the 
iniquity the Amorite was committing that when complete would justify his 
being cast out of his own land andor killed  Go back and look at Lev  
again  Verses  list a variety of sins including child sacrifice incest 
homosexuality and bestiality  Beginning in verse  God starts saying Do 
not defile yourselves by any of these things for byallthese things the 
nations which I am casting out before you have becomedefiled  For the 
land has become defiled therefore I have visited its punishment upon it so 
the land has spewed out its inhabitants For whoever does any of these 
abominations those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their 
people

Notice that God says the Gentile nations who are not under the ritual Law of 
Moses are about to be punished because they have defiled themselves and 
their land by committing abominations that include incest bestiality and 
homosexuality  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev  and you will find these 
same abominations listed and this time God decrees the death penalty on 
anyone involved in any of these things including specifically a man lying 
with another man as one lies with a woman Lv   Their 
bloodguiltiness was upon them meaning that in God's eyes they deserved to 
die for having done such things  According to Lev  even the alien 
nonJew who sojourns among you was to refrain from these practices on 
penalty of being cut off by God from among their people

Under the circumstances I believe it would be very difficult to support the 
claim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape and not 
the homosexuality in Sodom  Since God took the trouble to specifically list 
sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the 
Canaanite nations not homosexual rape mind you but plain voluntary gay 
sex I'd say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior even 
by those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant

For those Christians who do think that some parts of Leviticus can
be law for Christians while others are not even to be thought about
it is incumbent on you in every case handled on its own merits to
determine why you pick one and ignore another

According to II Tim  all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable 
for teaching reproof correction and training in righteousness thus I 
believe that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law we can 
learn from studying it  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is 
a violation of the Law then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law 
for example in the case of Sabbathkeeping  Where God reveals that certain 
actions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law then I 
conclude that God's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a 
person is under the Law but on the sinfulness of the act itself  In the case 
of homosexuality homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling 
abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews ie for those who are not under the 
Law as well as for those who are  Thus I am not at all trying to say that 
Gentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law I am simply 
saying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not 
obligated to keep the Law  If this is so then I do not think we can appeal to 
our exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has 
declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile

This is true The statement didn't say anything about Christians in general

 too holy to be observed by nonChristians as well as potentially dangerous

Does the dismissal in the early church mean that the eucharist was a

When we have had reason to conduct business meetings after church
we've made it clear that only members can vote  But we've always been

Do you have evidence for intentional secrecy  Other than rumours

mlspanixcom Michael Siemon writes
For those Christians who do think that some parts of Leviticus can
be law for Christians while others are not even to be thought about
it is incumbent on you in every case handled on its own merits to
determine why you pick one and ignore another  I frankly think the
whole effort misguided  Reread Paul No doubt I am free to do anything
But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this
the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor  If you cannot go
through Leviticus and decide each command there on that basis then
your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy  In this
context it is remarkably offensive to say
 
I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse

I am sorry you found this offensive  It was not my intent to offend  I was 
leading up to another point which I discuss in more detail below

Well latida  So what  This is almost as slimey an argument as the
one that homosexuality  rape  I know of no one who argues seriously
though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality  It is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians do
raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human
adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut  If you cannot address the actual issues you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world  If you want to address bestiality that is YOUR business not
mine  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in
our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing
us as human beings  You want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means
you can think of to do so

I can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for 
homosexuality  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of 
bestiality nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe  Let me ask 
this gently  why are you so judgemental of other people's sexual preferences  
What happened to No doubt I am free to do anything  I think you have a 
serious double standard here  When you describe a comparison between 
homosexuality and bestiality as slimey and sleazy you are making an 
implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted sinful disgusting 
unnaturalin short all the things that society once thought about 
homosexuality  Not all people share your view  You claim not to know any 
sincere zoophiles but this does not mean that they do not exist  They even 
have their own newsgroup  altsexbestiality  Are you going to accuse them 
all of being mere jokers

I notice you deleted the main point of my comment  the fact that the only 
Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical 
prohibitions against homosexuality  While there are some New Testament 
passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality there are none 
that condemn bestiality  One of your main points seems to be that Christian 
homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any clear New Testament 
statements against it if this is a valid argument then should not Christian 
zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament 
makes no reference clear or unclear to the subject at all

I am quite serious here  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically 
acceptable on the basis of your arguments then I am going to be fair and apply 
the same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well  If 
the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual 
preferences as well I'm going to apply them and see what comes up  I'm not 
trying to torpedo a serious issue by using what you label a ridiculous 
joke  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines 
for Christian sexuality and I don't think such a question is irrelevant in a 
group called socreligionchristian  The Bible discusses homosexuality and 
bestiality together in the same context and therefore I feel I have a good 
precedent for doing the same

Jesus and Paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length
the central linchpin of Christian moral thought we are required to
love one another and ALL else depends on that  Gay and lesbian Christ
ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms  and all we get
in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to sidetrack the issues

I don't know whether it makes any difference but for the record this is not a 
side issue for me  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging 
people to defile themselves therefore it is of high importance to determine 
whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling  I can read in the New 
Testament that God has joined together heterosexual couples and that the 
marriage bed is undefiled  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual 
intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under 
the Law  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards 
of defilement then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the 
sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days  I don't think it's 
right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to 
Christians today eg bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't  
That was pretty much what you said earlier right  You used different 
examples but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong 
to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians 

Christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here and in every
corner of USENET and the world and ALL they ever do is spout these same
old verses which they obviously have never thought about maybe never
even read in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with
the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they suppose great
emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even
taking the trouble to find out what it is

It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction  I personally don't 
get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual 
orientation I'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar 
attitude  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with 
child abuse  I have merely noted that for all the lack of clear NT 
condemnation of homosexuality there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation 
or even mention of bestiality a practice which a number of people eg on 
altsexbestiality consider to be their true sexual orientation

Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ
WHY for God's precious sake do you people quote irrelevant verses to
condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN
to BEFORE you start your condemnations  Is that loving your neighbor
God forbid  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or
condemn others  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in
insisting on this than the halfdozen obscure words in Paul that you are
SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do
 
Why for God's sake
 quote from John ff omitted for brevity

This is an excellent question and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere 
rhetorical question but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the 
answer  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you 
yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia  Why do you find 
bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in 
connection with other alternative sexual orientations  Why do you not apply 
all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply 
them to homosexuals

Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at 
the thought  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of 
homosexual intercourse  Is it because you regard the practice as socially 
unacceptable  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable  
Do you feel that it violates the traditional JudeoChristian standard of sexual 
morality  Many people feel that homosexuality does  Do you feel the Bible 
condemns it  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality 
than it does to condemn bestiality  Why then do you think comparing bestiality 
with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality  If you can honestly answer 
this question you will have come a long way towards understanding why many 
people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality

Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning people  I am merely 
pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual practices that 
the Bible appears to condemn eg sex outside of marriage  When I say I think 
adultery and premarital sex are sinful do you take that as me failing to love 
my neighbor  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and 
unmentionable are you disobeying repeated orders not to judge or condemn 
others  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you 
and judging you are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same 
offense  Or are you and I both simply taking note about practices the Bible 
brands as sinful and leaving the judgement of the people up to God

For long ages we many of us have been confused by evil counsel from
evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and
rejected  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably do
show a sinful shunning of God's light  Blessed are those whose spirits
have been crushed by the selfrighteous they shall be justified

However we have seen the Truth and the Truth is the light of humanity
and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light but our enemies who
fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow
it with the darkness of false witness against us
 
Michael L Siemon               I say You are gods sons of the
mlspanixcom                   Most High all of you nevertheless
     or                       you shall die like men and fall
mlsulyssesattcom            like any prince   Psalm 

I'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs  If you mean that Jesus 
is the Truth and that He accepts sinners and does not reject them then I 
agree  If we were not sinners then we would not need a Savior  Our 
salvation in Christ however does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us 
and we can now do whatever we want  Nor does Christ's grace mean that those 
who refer to sin as sin are being judgemental or intolerant  I am speaking 
in general terms here not specifically about homosexuality  If the Bible 
calls something sin then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it 
sin too

As applied to Christian homosexuality I think the only definitive authority on 
Christian sexuality is the Bible  If you make a list of everything the Bible 
says on the subject of homosexual intercourse I think you will find that every 
verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst and unclear at best  
The most progay statement you could make about the list is that there is some 
dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as 
condemning homosexual intercourse  That is from a gay perspective the most 
positive thing you can say about the Bible's treatment of homosexuality is that 
some verses fail to clearly condemn it  That's it  Jesus declared all foods 
clean the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to 
keep the ritual Law but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from 
being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian 
practice  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination 
that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law and you 
have some verses which are at best not clear but which some people believe 
are clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior and that's the sum 
total of what the Bible says about samesex intercourse

I can appreciate from personal experience your desire to have everything 
simple cutanddried blackandwhite whatIwant isok and 
thosewhoopposemearewicked  However I do not think the Bible makes your 
case as definitively as you would like it to  In fact I don't believe it says 
anything positive about your case at all  Yes I know the verses about loving 
one another and not judging one another but that's not really the issue is 
it  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for 
Christians to do since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you  
Therefore the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin  
Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses you are still 
left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about 
homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who 
are under the law and those who are not

 Mark


Actually I don't think the reaction to the comparision with
bestiality is based on bestialophobia  I think what he regards as
slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and
bestiality  Most people who accept homosexuality take a radical
approach to the Law  They regard all of Lev as not binding on
Christians  The argument is that there's no way in the text to
separate bestiality homosexuality and wearing mixed fabrics  This
does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct nor
does it mean that they accept bestiality  It simply means that their
sexual ethics does not come from the Law and particularly not from

   I've checked out Harwards Graphics for Windows I think its more
suitable for sales people than for preachers or Bible teachers to present
an outline of a message

   I'm looking for one that
  is great for overhead projector slides
  has or imports clip arts
  works with Word for Windows or imports Word for Windows files
  works with inkjet printers
   If you know of any that meets part or all of the above please let me know
Please email your response as I don't keep up with the newsgroup

Thanking you in advance

   The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in
any way  Since God knows everything He therefore knows everything that
is going to happen to us  We have free will and are able to change
what happens to us  However since God knows everything He knows all
the choices we will make in advance God is not subject to time  Too
often arguments pit predestination against free will  We believe in
both

Curiously enough this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life
recently  God's experience of time is so completely different from our own
since He is both within and without it  Using words like foreknowledge
and predestination are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing
God's perception of our action because for God the beginning living and
ending of our lives are all the same  Sort of  For God there is no before
when He did not know so he could not have foreknowledge of our lives or
a time when he could have predestined our actions  In fact since our
understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time I
would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our
free will interacts with God's control of the universe

When Elizabeth greeted Mary Elizabeth said something to the effect that
Mary out of all women was blessed  If so it appears that this
exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity

I remember a couple of times when my exgirlfriend said that she thought she
was blessed because of her son whom she loved dearly In fact I've heard
people refer to someone as being blessed quite a few times It's a common

Hypostasis
of the Logos Incarnate

Marhaba Nabil

If we posit two minds in Christ the mind of the logos and the mind of the
human Jesus then we must admit two wills  A mind is not a mind without a
will  I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements but there
is a philosophical problem here that should examined

T V Morris argued that the Incarnation can be seen like this

      		
     Mind of Logos
     	    
     		  	Here the mind of Jesus is circumsribed by God the
     	 Human	  	Son  God the Son has complete access to the human
        Mind	  	mind but the human mind only has access to the mind
     		  	of God the Son when the Son allows access  This 
     	  	explains why Jesus said even he did not know the 
     	time of the kingdom	

The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from
the field of psychology and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream seeing
yourself acting knowing that is you but also being omniscient  


I've explained it here before  If you want the full document ask me by mail
Rex 


   Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner
consciousness was composed of We need to clarify the two natures of Christ
briefly  The divine nature which has existed eternally did not undertake any
essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the
attributes of God the foremost of these being His immutability  This would
mean that it remained impassable that is incapable of suffering and death
free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation  In the realm
of the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which
was not absoluteand in Himself  The result of the incarnation was that the
divine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak could be tempted and suffer and die
not in His divine nature but by the derivation of His possession of a human
nature
     This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the
human nature are properties of the person and therefore ascribed to the
person By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent
omniscient and omnipresent yet at the same time be also a man of limited
power knowledge a man of sorrows subject to human wants and miseries  There
is however no penetration of one nature into the other  Deity can no more
share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential
perfection of the Godhead
     We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the
possession of the double natures  Christ's human nature is impersonal in that
it attains selfconsciousness and selfdetermination in the personality of the
Godman  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the
Man Nature is defined

the distinguishing qualities or properties of something the fundamental
character disposition or temperament of a living being innate and
unchangeable

     Nature is then in essence the substance possessed in common in as such
the Trinity have one nature  There is also a common nature of mankind 
Personality on the other hand is the separate subsistence of nature with the
power of consciousness and will  It is for this reason that the human nature
of Christ has not nor ever had a separate subsistence that it is impersonal
 LOGOS the Godman represents the principle of personality  It is equally
important to see that selfconsciousness and selfdetermination do not as
such belong to the nature  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say
that Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills but rather one  It is
theanthropic an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the
human and the divine natures being that neither the consciousness nor the will
are simply human or simply divine


The quotation given above is not identified and it's not entirely
clear to me what position Loren is taking on it  Just for clarity
let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic
Christological heresies  monothelitism  That's the position that
Christ's two natures were not complete in that there was only one
will  In most cases which I think includes this example it was the
human will that was regarded as missing

Normally people who talk about Christ's human nature as being
impersonal mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense  That is they
are using person as hypostatis not in the usual English sense of
personality  In this use the doctrine is called anhypostasia
Personally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of
denying that the Logos took on humanity fully  However it has never
been formally ruled a heresy and in fact has been held by influential
theologians both ancient and modern eg Athanasius  But the
quotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went
into the realm of the overtly heretical

cont Dr James DeYoung 

R Scroggs

     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and
suggested a new twist to the word  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a
Hellenistic Jewish coinage perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic
terminology  The term is derived from Lev    where the LXX
juxtaposes the two words arsenos male and koiten bed and represents
the Hebrew miskab zabar lying with a male   Yet he believes that Paul did
not originate the term but borrowed it from circles of Hellenistic Jews
acquainted with rabbinic discussions  n  It was invented to avoid
contact with the usual Greek terminology   If this is true Scroggs
observes it explains why the word does not appear in GrecoRoman discussions
of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it  It was meaningless to
nativespeaking Greeks 

     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the
object of the second part thus differing from Boswell's learned discussion
  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of one who lies with a
male to have a very narrow reference  With the preceding malokoi I Cor 
which Scroggs interprets as the effeminate callboy arsenokoitai is the
active partner who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on
occasion to satisfy his sexual desires   Hence arsenokoitai does not
refer to homosexuality in general to female homosexuality or to the generic
model of pederasty  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model he
affirms 
     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim  also  The
combination of pornoi fornicators arsenokoitai and andrapodistai slave
dealers refers to male prostitutes males who lie with them and slave
dealers who procure them   It again refers to that  specific form of
pederasty which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual
purposes and the use of these boys by adult males   Even serious
minded pagan authors condemned this form of pederasty  He then uses these
instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently
general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom  
Consequently Paul Must have had could only have had pederasty in mind 
We cannot know what Paul would have said about the contemporary model of
adultadult mutuality in same sex relation ships 

     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical
concerns Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of
vices in I Cor  have no deliberate intended meaning in Paul  The form and
function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped  Any
relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually
nonexistent  He concludes that Paul does not care about any specific item in
the lists  

     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary
phenomenon of a catalogue of vices  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are
irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today   The model
in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model
attacked by the NT that Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not
relevant to today's debate  They should no longer be used in denominational
discussions about homosexuality should in no way be a weapon to justify
refusal of ordination    

      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI

D Wright

     In more recent years the positions of Bailey Boswell and Scroggs have
come under closer scrutiny   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's
view is that by David Wright  In his thorough article Wright points out
several shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai   He faults
Boswell for failing to cite or citing inaccurately all the references to Lev
 and  in the church fathers such as Eusebius the Apostolic
Constitutions  Clement of Alexandria Tertullian and Origen  
Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term
derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages   This
is significant for if the term is so derived it clearly refutes Boswell's
claim that the first half of the word arseno denotes not the object but the
gender of the second half koitai  The LXX must mean a male who sleeps with
a male making arseno the object

     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the
term including suggested parallels   Though Boswell claims that
compounds with arseno employ it objectively and those with arreno employ it
as an adjective Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely
one of dialectical diversity No semantic import attaches to the difference
between the two forms   Wright believes that in most compounds in which
the second half is a verb or has a verbal force the first half denotes its
object and where the second part is substantival the first half denotes its
gender  

     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright
takes special issue because the former has failed to cite all the sources 
For example Aristides' Apology c AD  probably uses arrenomaneis
androbaten and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male
homosexuality  contrary to Boswell's discussion  Boswell fails to cite
Hippolytus Refut Omn Haer  and improperly cites Eusebius and the
Syriac writer Bardensanes  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to
the Syriac of I Cor  and I Tim   

     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in
parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers the
dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks   Sometimes this
parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia adultery porneia
fornication and paidophthoria with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris
  Clement of Alexandria in Protr  cites the second table of the
Ten Commandments as You shall not kill ou moicheuseis you shall not commit
adultery ou paidophthoreseis you shall not practice homosexuality with
boys you shall not steal    n 

     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein commit homosexuality exists in the
Sibylline Oracles   It may be Wright observes that the word was
coined by a Jewish preChristian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by
OrSib book  

     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius th c who drew
upon the first century AD writer Teucer in Macarius thth c and in John
the Faster d    The last in particular bears the idea of
homosexual intercourse contrary to Boswell

     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be
absent from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted
  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to
the first century AD since it did not exist before then that the Greeks used
dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality that some sources eg
Didache show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing
Scripture and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers  

     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention
  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom
omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue  Chrysostom gives a
long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom
  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term  Wright
observes that Boswell has signally failed to demonstrate any us of
arsenokoites etc in which it patently does not denote male homosexual
activity   It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature
and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly
specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the GrecoRoman world 

     Wright also surveys the Latin Syriac and Coptic translations of I Tim
and I Cor  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning
homosexual ie they understand arseno as the object of the second half of
the word   None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited
conclusion based on them

     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the
catalogues of vices as a literary form  He believes that such lists developed
in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of
homosexuality in the Greek world  This paralleled the increased concern on the
part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence  The term came into
being under the influence of the LXX  so that writers spoke generally of
male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual
engagement with paides   If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were
interchangeable it is because the former encompassed the latter 

     In summary Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning
homosexuality and arises with Judaism   The views of Boswell Scroggs and
others who limit the term to active male prostitutes or pederasty are without
significant support from linguistic and historical studies  

Next the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson  After that we
get into the good stuff of historical  linguistic studies  THis will
include Symposium by Plato  If there is any doubt as to the modern
understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of
Paul this will certainly clear things up  Also we will review Paul's use of
Lev in the NT and how as for him  the Law was fulfilled but not done
away with  Lev  was the universal and the following chapters the
general  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our
culture should stick around for this one

 R Scroggs THe New Testament and Homosexuality Phil    
Independently we came to the same conclusion  Apparently the connection is
made in EA Sophocles Greek Lexicon of the Roman  Byzantine Periods from
BC to AD 
   See discussion   He says the same thing about Paul's language in
Rom    But this is doubtful  See the more cautious words of P
Zaas I Cor ff Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church SBLASP
   He observes that the words moixai malakoi and arsenokoitai
were part of Jewish antiGentile polemic  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the
vice list and such were some of you indicate that Paul is addressing real
or potential abuses of his ethical message not citing primitive tradition by
rote   Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry

  On Boswell's treatment of Rom  the article by RB Hays Relations
Natural and Unnatural  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans  JRE
 Spring   is an excellent critique
  DF Wright Homosexuals or Prostitutes  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI I
Cor  I Tim  VC  
  In an unpublished paper Henry Mendell ARSENOKOITAI Boswell on Paul
effectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai 
He finds the meaning to be general a male who has sex with a male   
  Wright's endnotes  list additional sources in the church fathers
   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the
references to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha  See  JB
DeYoung A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and
Pseudepigrapha BSac  
   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai
points to a meaning lacking homosexual significance Wright asks pertinently
why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria nor Josephus paiderastia
and why   Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former   n
  In a more recent article Homosexuality The Relevance of the Bible EvQ
  Wright reiterates these same points  Paul shows a
remarkable originality in extending the OT ethic to the church

 is going to happen to us  We have free will and are able to change
 what happens to us  However since God knows everything He knows all

That last sentence of Steve's is an important one to remember

There are certain things in the Catholic religion that cannot be
completely comprehended by a human being  Were this not the case it
would be good evidence that the religion was manmade

In the case of predestination you have to reconcile two things that
would at first appear to be irreconcilable the sovereignty of God's
will over all things and man's free will in deciding his own fate
Catholics believe in both  But that doesn't mean that anyone has come
up with a pat reconciliation

I have often thought that Goedel's famous theorem has applicability to
Catholic dogma at least in an analogous sense there are things that
are true that cannot be proved  God's intellect is far above ours
There are many truths that we will never be able to understand

  When Elizabeth greeted Mary with the words Blessed art thou

But Deborah says Judges

It can doubtless be taken that Jael's slaying of Sisera was a type
of Mary's victory over sin But even if we take Deborah's words as
applying prophetically or symbolically to Mary they must still be
applicable literally to Jael  We may well take them to mean that
God used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His
people and that she has this in common with Mary  But we have no
reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless and thus no
reason to take the like expression applied to Mary as proof that she
was sinless

Metaexegesis Conviction of Sin  part II

Let me return to the question stipulating that Paul meant his use of
arseonkoitai to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition
of malemale sex  In order to bring out the problems most clearly I'll
also stipulate what I think is far less plausible that Paul coined the
term for this usage  The question I want to turn to is what that would
mean for Paul's readers and for later Christians  This should be shorter
than my last note as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us
with some of the major divisions within Christ's body and I am not trying
to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that
separate any of us from our fellow Christians  My own biases loosely
characterizable as liberal will be evident but I am not grinding an
axe here so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD
to reach closure when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we
each in our own different ways see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ

So stipulating Paul's intent the immediate question is HOW CAN HIS
READERS UNDERSTAND this intent  And following on that question there is
a second one WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we do manage to understand him

Since Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of st
Corinthians there are two positive answers and one negative to this
question

	a  Paul or Apollos or someone in the apostolic community has
	    conveyed to the Corinthians the thentraditional Jewish condem
	    nation of homosexual behavior and Paul expects them to be
	    sufficiently welltutored by this tradition that he needs no
	    futher explanation  I should note that there is no evidence
	    in the letter or in  Corinthians for such a supposition 

	b  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means or if not Paul
	    what God means behind Paul's inspired wordchoice

	c  We don't know and cannot guess to within any better pre
	    cision here than for comparison in the parallel use by Paul
	    in the same passage of the word  pleonektai those who have
	    more  if you think that areseonkoitai is obvious from
	    its roots try cutting your teeth on this word  The NEB
	    translates it as grabbers or even methusoi drunkards
	     at least this has the advantage of being a common insult
	    so that at least there is some hint as to its meaning

The three positions more or less  if I can be allowed some exaggeration
for the sake of argument  define a classical Catholic attitude towards
tradition one form of Protestant sola scriptura and a liberalcritical
demand for evidence  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses

ad a	It is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the
	community of Christ's disciples and their successors and that
	our NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition
	But it's also the case that we know little or nothing about this
	tradition until almost a century after Paul which is to say that
	we have access to the tradition only after several generations of
	possibly confused transmission  The scripture is itself our only
	documentation of the tradition in the critical era

ad b	If we are NOT born of water and Spirit to revert to John in an
	attempt to explain Paul  then we have no more hope of under
	standing the gospel than Nicodemus had neither the traditions of
	men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit
	from blowing where it will  the Paraclete is a kamikaze  But
	the downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit
	as our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that
	takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent
	understanding supposedly derived from the clear Word of God

		Note classical Lutheran Calvinist and Anglican thought
		constrains scripture to be read within tradition even
		while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture
		the more bizarre forms of I will read Scripture my way
		are primarily a fringe aspect of cultic Protestantism

	The main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no
	means for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel
	is teaching received from the Spirit and history shows incredible
	conflict between Christians on this point each in his own mind
	convinced that he is led by the Spirit  No one can seriously
	urge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian
	against Christian  To what purpose

ad c	The critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can
	reach a conclusion it can lay out the data in a way which is open
	to all  The weakness is an obvious corollary this is not usually
	possible 

	If I may say a word here out of my own already acknowledged bias
	one complaint against critical methodology is that it dissolves
	faith  but surely a faith that cannot honestly face the evalu
	ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to
	address

Anyway there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between
liberal and conservative positions mostly on the basis of extreme
zealots of positions b and c  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition
tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position so that
despite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as
ultimately divisive as the Protestant world will  And Anglicans will I
predict muddle through on the via media attempting to give each position
its due but no more than its due 

Second question  Suppose tradition tells us and lots of spiritual
Christians tell us and critical thought at least admits as possible
that Paul is refering to a flat universal Levitical prohibition against
malemale sex  What then  Again we can abdicate our personal responsi
bility to tradition and let it dictate the answer  But it's precisely
where inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they're most dangerous

We have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of
tradition despite his urging in Matthew  that we are to heed them
We have EXAMPLES of Peter and more radically still Paul jettisoning the
traditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question  Jesus
and Peter and Paul do not so much throw out tradition as subject it to
radical criticism on a couple of very basic grounds

     the weightier demands of the law justice and mercy and good faith
							Matthew 
and  On these two commandments love God  neighbor hand the whole Law
      and the Prophets also
							Matthew 

If there is a fundamental because derived from Christ validity in the
challenge to some traditions a validity that led the first generation
to go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts
vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus' reported
words and deeds it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination
to postulate that only the traditions that we have specific challenges
against are in fact open to challenge

All traditions passed through men are traditions of men  That God may
lead us even so that these traditions are a source of our spiritual
instruction I will freely grant  But tradition is inherently human and
inherently corruptible and given the Fall corrupt  Nothing in it is
immune to challenge when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice mercy
and good faith  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from
love of God and love of neighbor

I am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin  That
the Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me or I am
too dense to learn  That tradition might have value here  But what I
know of tradition is that on one occasion some superstitious Christians
appealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor and scapegoated
sodomites as the cause of the earthquake so that legislation was
passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense  If that is in
accord with the gospel of Christ then I am no Christian  That is human
tradition at its most hateful and vicious  And I see nothing all that much
different in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick
to condemn but slow to understand  If that is the leading of the Spirit
then I want no part of it  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord
is that I am myself TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians
for the truth that lives in the Body of Christ

And I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel
said to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church

	be careful how you deal with these people  If this enterprise
	this movement of theirs is of human origin it will break up of
	its own accord but if it does in fact come from God you will not
	only be unable to destroy them but you might find yourselves
	fighting against God
							Acts  

All I ask is that you listen to your traditions and read your scriptures
with a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit and to the past history of our
first Christian witnesses' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER
readings of scripture  though read with all the authority of scribes and
rabbis  and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the
love of God and neighbor  Then study the evidence learn the history of
Christians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to
judge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge  And let the witness of
the Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians  including those who
are NOT of your preference in theology  guide you towards God's truth

There's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position a as to
whether you're speaking of tradition in Paul's time or ours  I think
there are two ways to use tradition  One is to say that when Paul and
his readers share a tradition it makes sense to interpret his words
in the context of that shared tradition  That's what makes me think
that these arguments over words turn out to be silly  We know that
Paul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex
Everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background
The tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom  is consistent with
that background  Even if the words in the sin lists aren't the most
general terms for homosexual activity and it seems to me that there's
some evidence that they are not they are just one more piece of
evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no
evidence at all  that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of
homosexuality

But when you identify a with the Catholic position that's rather a
horse of a different color  The Catholic position involves a
continuing church tradition  Arguments specific to that tradition
might be  we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul's original
meaning from tradition eg the way the Church Fathers interpreted
him and  we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in
our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his
time and ours  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition
A radical Protestant might be willing to use known st Cent
tradition to illuminate Paul's original meaning but not use the
Catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to
homosexuality should be

I don't necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it since I see 
no 
Biblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy  
 
Early in Church history the catechumens were dismissed prior to the 
celebration 
of the Eucharist  It WAS secret giving rise to the rumors that Christians
were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims  The actions were considered
too holy to be observed by nonChristians as well as potentially dangerous
for the individual Christian who might be identified
 
Larry Overacker lloshellcom sig deleted for brevity

Larry 

Thanks for the reply but this isn't quite the same thing  Like I said before 
I can understand why nonChristians would be denied access to holy 
ceremonies but the ceremony itself communion was not secret  In fact all 
four gospels record the first breaking of the bread in some detail  
Communion was a fellowship meal and it was and still should be in my 
opinion inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of 
the Body of Christ  The fact that unbelievers denied access to these communal 
meals began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during 
communion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact 
hiding shameful things from the general public  In fact I think if you read 
some of the early church fathers you will find that they were not at all 
bashful about describing what went on during communion  That's why it seems 
funny to me when Mormons who claim to be the only true restoration of st 
century Christianity insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they 
are too sacred

 Mark

Actually that's not quite the case  John omits the central elements
of the Last Supper  His Gospel is full of symbolism of bread and
wine  But the actual story isn't there  Some people think he has
omitted some of the details because they were not talked about in
public in his community  There is also evidence that some aspects of
baptismal practice were kept secret See Morton Smith's Secret
Gospel  I don't agree with his lurid speculations on what the
secret practices actually were but there does seem to be some
evidence that Mark omitted certain details because they were 
inappropriate for publication  clh

referring to Mary
She was immaculately conceived and so never subject to Original Sin
but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life  This was
possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God

I have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a sin
Was Mary fully human  If it is possible for God to miraculously make 
a person free of original sin and free of committing sin their whole
life then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus  Why can't
God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us
sinless without the need for repentance and salvation and all that

concept of Mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the
rest of Christian doctrine as I understand it

It's always a twoway street  God gave her the grace to avoid sin
thus when she was visited by Gabriel she gave her fiat her total
acceptance of God's will  This fiat summarizes why Catholics regard 
her as the highest of all humans that God chose her and that she
accepted  Knowing this in advance we extrapolate that she was
neither stained by nor subject to original sin

God did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin
Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of God to
command it  This amount of grace was precisely determined by God
to be the amount required to do what God asked of her  The grace
given to each of us is also enough but we do not always choose
to accept it  We also believe Jesus was fully human and never
sinned  

God could have created a much better person than myself one who
always chose the right thing yet he created me instead despite
my flaws  He proves he loves me as I am continually drawing me
towards perfection  For whatever purpose he has for me he has
confidence that I will accomplish it  If I ask God to repeat his
miraculous creation of the mother of his son where will that leave me

Bill Rea cctrcantuacanterburyacnz wrote
 His theology clashed with the theology of the
 local prophets It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic
 covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah
 spoke his prophesies The judgement prophesies were deeply loaded with
 theological meaning

 In my opinion both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson
 New York will burn prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic
 theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies

Perhaps one other thing I should have added is that Jeremiah's prophesies
about the coming destruction of Jerusalem would have been understood by
the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding
of their relationship with the Lord Today the if the general populace 
hears prophesies like the Portland earthquake or New York will burn
ones they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship
or lack of it with the Lord They are far more likely to think that
they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter
That is one reason why I am always deepy suspicious of bald judgement
prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement This
doesn't have to be long winded To see a relatively modern example look
at Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural speech The relevant section is
below It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both
prophesies posted here

 Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln's nd Inaugural speech

Both read the same Bible and pray 
to the same God and each invokes His aid against the other It may seem 
strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing 
their bread from the sweat of other men's faces but let us judge not
that we be not judged The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither
has been answered fully The Almighty has His own purposes ''Woe unto the
world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to
that man by whom the offence cometh If we shall suppose that American 
Slavery is one of those offences which in the provdence of God must needs come
but which having  continued through  His appointed time He now wills to remove
and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to
those by whom the offence came shall we discern therein an departure from
those divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always  ascribe 
to Him  Fondly do we hope  fervently do we pray  that this mighty 
scourge of war may speedily pass away Yet if God wills that it continue 
until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of 
unrequited  toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn  with 
the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three 
thousand  years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the Lord 
are true and righteous altogether
  With malice toward none with charity for all  with firmness in the right 
as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we 
are in to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall have 
borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan  to do all which 
may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves 
and with all nations

Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should 
check out Dignity Integrity More Light Presbyterian churches Affirmation
MCC churches etc  Meet some gay Christians find out who they are pray
with them discuss scripture with them and only then form your opinion

also check out the episcopal church  although by no means all
episcopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women there
certainly is a fairly large percentage in my experience who are  i
am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and
living in a monogamous homosexual relationship  this in no way
diminishes his ability to minister  in fact he has a very
significant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his
community as well as a very significant aids ministry

This may sound argumentative but do the prohomosexual crowd give the
same support to church members that are involved in incestuous relationships
If we do a little substitution above we get

Do the same standards apply  If not why not  And while we're in the
ballpark what about bestiality  I can't recall offhand if there are
any direct statements in the Bible regarding sex with animals does that
activity have more or less a sanction

Please avoid responses such as you're taking this to extremes  I would
guess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant Bible community
views homosexual acts with distaste in the same manner that society at
large views incest

 Obviously you can replace homosexuality in the above statement by
anything from murder to sleeping late  That doesn't mean that the
same people would accept those substitutions  The question is whether
the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to
represent Christ's relationship to humanity  This is at least
partly an empirical question  

In some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because
over time they always seem to lead to trouble  I think that's the
case with slavery  One can argue that in theory if you follow Paul's
guidelines it's possible to have Christian slaveholders  But in
practice over a period of time most people came to the conclusion
that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and
not abuse it  

The message you were responding to was asking you to look at the
results from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality  Note
Christian homosexuals not people you see on the news advocating some
extremist agenda  You may not want to base your decision completely
on that kind of observation but I would argue that it's at least
relevant  You can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't
look at the Incest association because in fact there is no such
association  If there were it might be reasonable for you to look at
it too  Of course that doesn't mean that the results of all such
examinations would necessarily come out the same way  Part of why
there aren't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that
some of them do produce obviously bad results

 other ways

You are quite confident that essences do not exist  How do propose to
define beings  Can a thing can be one without definition  Can a being
have a definition and know essence

What about properties  Do beings have properties  Does God have
properties

Does numbers exist in reality as abstract entities or do we invent them

 Thus to me the unity of God must be primary and the triality must be
 secondary must be modal or aspectual relating to roles or to modes

 I have been studying the Bible now for about a year  I love it
but I am not very familiar with the different denominations or
traditions or common beliefs of various christian groups
I have heard various people outside this news group
describe idols such as power money material 
possessions etc  These things are worshiped in some sense I 
suppose but I never really gave idols much thought  Until now  

I have been reading the postings in this news group which I 
just found a few days ago and I have a question  First I'm
not trying to question anyone's belief or try to push my views
on anyone else I haven't been at this long enough to have
any views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good
I must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that
I could be saved and I need to repent ie realize that
every time I sin I might as well stick a sharp stick in
Christ's side because He took the punishment for my sins
when He died on the cross

In my studies Mary never really comes up  I know who she is 
but that's about it  It seems to me that a statue of Mary 
could be considered an idol  Do people pray to statues of Mary

It sounds like educated christians more educated than myself
I'm sure believe Mary was sinless  Wow  I hoped to spend
the summer convincing myself one way or the other about
Tongues I'm reading Charismatic Chaos  I guess I'll study
Tongues in parallel with reading this news group  Any help you can 
give me will be appreciated

    

I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than
you though it may well be that they are as that they come from a
different tradition than yours

This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants  Catholics
generally believe that Mary was sinless  Protestants do not  The
issue comes down to different sources of authority  Protestants
generally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine
Since this isn't in the Bible except in passages that no one would
understand in this way if they didn't already believe it Protestants
don't accept it  Catholics see continuing revelation through the
Church though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible

I interpret your posting not as a call for yet another argument about
whether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry an argument I am
not prepared to see newed here but as a sign of being interested in
learning about traditions other than your own  Catholics are of
course a major one but by no means the only one  I generally
consider the major traditions to be Catholic Orthodox and
various subsets of Protestantism  Within Protestantism it's a matter
of how finely you want to cut things  These days I think the major
division is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those
who don't  There are also a number of major historical traditions
but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur  I'd 
identify the major Protestant traditions as

  Lutheran Reformed Anglican they're sort of halfway between
  Catholic and Protestant Wesleyan Baptist Holiness Pentecostal
  Church of Christ

But there are a number of others  Historical distinctions tend not to
be so important among the liberal churches anymore and I think
current trends in society and the Church are also tending to make
conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general evangelical
perspective  But differences among these various traditions are still
quite marked

I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book
on church history  Anyone who wants to understand the church really
needs to understand how we got where we are now  A church history
will normally show you where each of these traditions came from and
give a feeling for their nature  Unfortunately I'm away from my
library at the moment so I don't have anything specific to recommend

of Roman Catholic hagiography produced by the Bollandists has ever been
translated into English  I'm working on the Vita S Dympnae and would love
to be able to check my own translation against somebody else's

  A weekly dialogue with a local pastor on the news of the day

                    THIS WEEK'S THOUGHTS 

Last week the Supreme Court refused without comment to hear an
appeal by Rensselaer IN school officials desiring the
distribution of Bibles in their public schools REL  A
lower court had banned the local Gideons an international Bible
distribution group from passing out Bibles to fifthgraders The
ACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action
protected the religious neutrality of our public schools He also
said that schools must serve students of all faiths and none
Schools were not to be a bazaar where rival religious groups
compete for converts according to Lynn

Several Gideons men who are responsible for putting Bibles in
hospitals and hotels are members of our church They tell of
similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on
sidewalks around the schools but cannot go inside the schools
They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their
children receiving a Bible from a stranger They are willing to
continue their work at a distance but find the school's position
somewhat disheartening

I understand rationally and logically the court's position And I
can see the sense of fairness for all groups But on the other
hand when does neutrality become nihilism When does plurality
turn into no position at all

I see a couple of ironies here One is that we can pass out condoms
but not Bibles in our schools Think on that one for a moment

The other is that while we are seeking religious neutrality in
our schools countries like Russiawho by the way practiced
religious neutrality for the past seventy yearsare making the 
Bible part of their public school curriculum When I was in St
Petersburg in March the church we worked with had trained over 
public school teachers to teach the Bible and the government had
requested hundreds more I recently heard a medical doctor who is
president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly
invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the
students and are given class time to explain its contents I
remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and
speaking to the university students standing under a statue of
Lenin Now that's ironic

I admit two things  We are a pluralistic society and all faiths
have equal footing This is what our country was founded on  To
allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaarlike
atmosphere Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions
and provide a hearing for them I know I said twoThe vitality
of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public
arena acknowledges it as valid

Howeverand you knew this was comingI believe disallowing the
distribution of the Bible by lawabiding caring adults in our
schools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a
singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make
moral and ethical decisions

Good column re TIME coverstory about teen sexuality I agree
with moral education from home but some homes don't have the kinds
of morals I want taught  One family I worked with smoked dope as
their primary family activity  Another acted like incest was OK
Families no matter where they are are often a lot sicker than
we'd like to believe

From John Hightower MC 

John

I agree that the home ain't what it used to be and some homes
are NOT the place to learn valuebased sexuality I still believe
that this is where the church can come into play I know those
families you speak of may not come to a church to seek information
but the help does not need to be in a church buildingI believe
that the youth from the families you mentioned will probably
disregard the valuefree information at school too

I see a parallel between what I will stupidly call the homosexual 
issue and the atheist issue Please take no offense at these
comparisons

The homosexual feels things that I admit I do not feel 
He learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings
and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to
his feelings which he then can fit with his experiences
That is this model gives him a sense of understanding his
situation Models that do not match up with what he knows he
feels will be discarded However one wonders if once accepting
the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that
means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on 
the definition he has already accepted which of course validates
his model

If that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel

The Christian feels things that an atheist claims he does not
feel The Christian accepts the Christian theology as the true
description of what his feelings mean Once accepting this
model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model
which of course validates his Christianity

As a reminder I am a Christian a Catholic I don't hate 
homosexuals or atheists but am just trying to understand
them I only compare them because they are both so foreign
to me Am I as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems
blind to me Or am I as prejudiced against atheistic denial of
religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against 
attempts by society to deny his sexuality

Or am I just out to lunch again

After reading this story about St Maria Goretti posted two weeks
ago I am a bit confused  While it is clear that her daily
life is one of probity and sanctity I am afraid I don't quite
understand the final episode of her life  I am reading it 
correctly she and the Church apparently felt that being raped
was a sin on her part one so perfidious that she would rather
die than commit it  If this is the case I'm afraid that I 
disagree rather strongly

Can anyone out there explain this one to me

Yours in Christ

 Hate the sin but love the sinnerI've heard that quite a bit recently 
 often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality
 but the context really isn't that important My question is whether that
 statement is consistent with Christianity I would think not

I'm very grateful for scott's reflections on this oftquoted phrase  Could
someone please remind me of the Scriptural source for it  Rom  doesn't
count kids  The manner in which this little piece of conventional wisdom is
                 
applied has in my experience been uniformly hateful and destructive

Yes those who apply it hatefully would be better served if they if
they could alter the Bible to reflect their views

Scene   A well in Samaria

Woman  But I have no husband
Jesus  Yo  Everybody  Listen up  Get your rocks ready  We'll have
        some good biblical fun  Here she is whispering to me that
        she doesn't have a husband yet I know by my secret powers that
        she has had five of them  You know how these Samaritans are
        And worse she's living with a guy now that she's not even married
        to  Now I believe in loving her and if you'll just raise up
        those rocks like the bible allows and threaten her with a good
        stoning she'll understand how much we hate the sin but love
        the sinner   We must keep our priorities strait lest folks
         years from now misunderstand me and believe I canceled
        all sin

Scene   Golgatha

nd Thief  You got a raw deal man  They didn't catch you doing anything
            wrong like they caught me

Bleeding Jesus  Now son  Let me be real clear  You say you did something
            wrong but are you repenting  I need to be absolutely certain
            cause if you repent I have a nice room for you in heaven
            but if you think you might go thieving again I have to
            cancel your reservation  It is nice of you to have pity on
            me while I'm hanging here but you must understand this is
            all an act I'm not really hurting  I'm God you see  And
            the point of all this is to teach you to be perfect like me
            If you think a simple kind remark to me in suffering is going
            to get you any favors you'd better think twice  But if you
            will just REPENT you will become a Fundelical in Good 
            Standing

He is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we the
members of the church Agree to Disagree on the issue admitting that
both sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead
them to different conclusions  It worked last year when the abortion
issue threatened to do more or less the same thing and he is hopeful that
the GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree
with their own view


Cliff Slaughterbeck            

people would not be willing to  Note that the church was not willing
to live with this kind of compromise with ordination of women  The
one thing that will definitely prevent a person from becoming a
Presbyterian minister is if they indicate that they don't accept
ordination of women  The argument is that we can't have half the
church not accepting the leaders of the other half  Maybe people will
 clh

It might be interesting for folk to know that the Church of Scotland
also a Presbyterian church  managed to agree to disagree over
women's ordination for  years  The reasoning was that congregations
are free to call whoever they wish and that Ministers and Sessions
choose elders  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman they
were not obliged to and if a Session did not wish to they could not
be forced to  Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part
of the Congregation is VERY important here  this year is the th
Annivarsary of the Disruption where the church split on that very
issue they didn't get back together for almost  years

A couple of years ago on the  anniversary of the allowing of womens
ordination the position was changed  so that in theory all
ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained  In
theory a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session or
refused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery could be
disciplined  In practice this has not happened and I believe it is
unlikely to happen  My personal view is that the new legislation was
a mistake and that the permissive but not prescriptive legislation
worked very well  

We are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years
assembly  At this years a motion was put to ban the blessing of
samesex couples after an Edinburgh minister did so  Our Panel on
Doctrine is currently looking at marriage and will report next year 
the matter will be considered and debated then

Hope this is interesting

 After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts  months it 
 has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with 
 Liberals Catholics New Agers' and Athiests  Someone might think 
etc

Since when did conservative protestant oldtime religion believers get
an exclusive francise to christianity  Christianity is and always has
been a diverse and contentious tradition and this group reflects that
diversity  I fo one am not ready to concede to any group be they
liberal or conservative catholic protestant or orthodox charismatic
or not the right to claim that they have the truth and everyone else
is not christian

I am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take Paul's illustration
about one body  many parts far too narrowly It is easy to say that the one
body represents a particular sect of Christianity generally our own and
the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry There is a place for
that But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide
variety of doctine  Catholic Protestant liberal conservative Orthodox
etc  I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the
context of the 'body of Christ' And I am equally sure that one day after
we shug off this mortal coil when we no longer see through a glass darkly
but see clearly face to face we will all be ashamed at some of the things
we held as truth We ought all fellowship worship and serve where we are
called and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone
else is called

One of the fathers of the reformation help me out  can't recall the name
put it quite succiently

	In essentials unity
	In nonessentials liberty
	In all things charity

While I agree with Lewis Mere Christianity that calling oneself a Christian
implies some basic fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean
anything at all I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit
too broadly deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those
bounds and ignore the requirements of charity all together 

Me I attend a Vineyard church speak in tongues am effectively an
inerrantist though I'll grant some inaccuracy in translation am moderately
premill and evangelical But I'm not ready to damn those who use icons
say mass in latin uphold the Virgin Mary though I really don't believe
that she was sinless vote on Church membership or insist on baptism for
salvation Of course I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth 
why would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth
But my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually
evolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him studying His word
and fellowshiping with others in the often extended family

In article  jhpbsartobuddlakenjus Joseph H Buehler writes

 Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently and that's 
 one primary reason why they baptize babies  They believe that Baptism 
 produces a change in the soul of the baby quite independently of any 
 volitional act on the part of the baby  This change in the baby's soul 
 gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have 
 without Baptism  Since the infant does not have the use of his 
 intellect and will yet these new faculties are dormant  But as the 
 child gets older the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play 

   I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried 
out  When you think your army is stronger than mine you would 
righteously take my children and baptize them doing what you know is 
really best for them
   You cannot possibly put this kind of action nor the crusades into the 
context of the teachings of JesusGod  I think he advocated a different 
approach that was by design made to be appealing to those called by him 
not chosen by a church practice
   It seems to me you have the cause and effect switched the change comes 
and then you get baptized

THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING
OF ARSENOKOITAI WITH IMPLICATIONS
FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY

                                      James B DeYoung

W Petersen

     More recently Wright's understanding has itself been questioned from a
different direction  In a brief  study William Petersen found linguistic
confusion in using the English word homosexuals as the meaning of
arsenokoitai   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for
rendering it by homosexuals in I Cor  and I Tim 

     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey Boswell and Scroggs into a
single assertion that reiterates in effect the position of Bailey  He finds
homosexuals unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic  A
major disjunction exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the
thought and terminolgy in Paul's time 

      What is this disjunction  He bases it on historical and linguistic
facts  Accordingly ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as
polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts 
Virtually all forms of behavior except transvestism were acceptable 
Christianity simply added the categories of natural and unnatural in
describing these actions  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of
homosexuals and heterosexuals and assumed that in the words of Dover
quoted approvingly by Petersen everyone responds at different times to both
homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli    

      In contrast to this modern usage virtually limits the term homosexual
to desire and propensity  KM Benkert who in  coined the German term
equivalent to homosexual used it as referring to orientation impluse or
affectional preference and having nothing to do with sexual acts 

     Petersen then proceeds to cite the Supplement to the Oxford English
Dictionary  which defines homosexual only as a propensity or desire with no
mention of acts  Petersen's point is that by using homosexuals for
arsenokoitai one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history
where no equivalent concept existed   Consequently the translation is
inaccurate because it includes celibate homophiles    incorrectly exludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts    andincorrectly includes
female homosexuals   Prior to  there was no cognitive structure
either inour society or in antiquity within which the modern bifurcation of
humanity into 'homosexuals' and 'hetersosexuals' made sence 

     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio
homosexual is mistaken  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one
mistaken on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds  The next
phases of this paper will critically examine Petersen's position

                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING
                          ARSENOKOITAI BY HOMOSEXUALS

Historical Grounds

     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai
by homosexuals begins with the historical and cultural evidence  Since
virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul's
usage no historical settings earlier than his are available  Yet much writing
reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary
with Paul  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of
homosexuality particularly homosexual orientation in a way similar to
presentday concepts  

     Peterson Bailey Boswell and Scroggs claim that the homosexual
condition desire propensity or inversion whatever it is called cannot be
part of the definition of the term  They assert this either because the term
is limited to acts of particular kind Boswell active male prostitutes 
Scroggs pederasty or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient
times Bailey Petersen  The following discussion will show why neither of
these positions is legitimate  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion
first with the former one being addressed below under Linguistic Grounds

     In regard to the latter position one may rightfully ask did not the
homosexual condition exist before   Is it only a modern phenomenon Yet if
it is universal as alleged today it must have existed always including
ancient times even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it 
Indeed evidence show that the ancients preChristian and Christian not only
knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior including all forms of
samesex activity transvestism included but also knoew about samesex
orientation or condition  Petersen admits  n  that Plato in
Symposium dd may be a sole possible exception to ancient
ingnorance of this condition  He discounts this however believing that even
here acts appear to be the deciding factor  However this is a very
significant exception hardly worthy of being called an exception because of
the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition

     THe Symposium of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for
knowledge about the homosexual condition    Plato posits a third sex
comprised of a mailefemale androgynon manwoman Hence original nature
palai physis consisted of three kinds of human beings  Zeus sliced these
human beings in half to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the
gods  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half either one of the
opposite sex or one of the same sex  Plato then quotes Aristophances

    Each of us then is but a tally of a man since every one shows like
    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two  and each is ever
    searching for the tally that will fit him  All the men who are sections
    of that composite sex that at first was called manwoman are 
    womancourters  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex
    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses
    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men
    they are incllined rather to women and of this stock are the sheminions
    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine and so long as 
    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by
    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be
    clasped in men's embrasces  these are the finest boys and striplings
    for they have the most manly nature  Some say they are shameless
    creatures but falsely  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness
    but to daring manliness and virility since they are quick to welcome
    their like  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity
    these alone prove in a public career to be men  So when they come
    to man's estate they are boylovers and have no natural interest in
    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of
    custom  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days
    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the 
    willing mate of a man eagerly greeting his own kind  Well when
    one of them whether he be a boylover or a lover of any other sort 
    happens on his own particular half the two of them are wondrously 
    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love and are hardly to be 
    induced to leave each other's side for a single moment  These are
    they who continue together throughout life though they could not
    even say what they would have of one another dc 

Should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as
long as they live or even in Hades Aristophanes says that each would
unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all
the time  e

     Several observations about this text are in order  Lesbianism is
contemplated as will as male homosexuality e  Natural interest ton
noun physei b refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination 
The words born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man 
paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai b reflect the modern claims to
be born this ie as homosexual  The idea of mutuallity the two of them
are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love b is
present  Aristophanes even speaks of mutual love ingrained in mankind
reassembling our early estate ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai
tes archaias physeos synagogeus d The concept of permanency These are
they who continue together throughout life c is also present  Further
mention of andor allusion to permanecy mutality gay pride pederasty
homophobia motive desire passion and the nature of love and its works is
recognizable

    Clearly the ancients thought of love homosexual or other apart from
actions  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is
crucial  money office influence etc   bring reproach ea b 
They mention the need to love the soul not the body e  There are tow
kinds of love in the body b and each has its desire and passion
bd  The speakers discuss the principles or matters of love c the
desires of love c and being males by nature c  Noteworthy is the
speech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is
related to love and its objects ac  Desire is felt for what is not
provided or present for something they have not or are not or lack  This is
the object of desire and love  Socrates clearly distinguishes between what
sort of being is love and the works of love e  This ancient
philosopher could think of both realms seaual acts as well as disposition of
being or nature  His wors have significance for more than pederasty 

     In summary virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and
homosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato  Petersen is in error
when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts not
inclination or orientation  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the
latter 

     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where
homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction  In
Rom  such phrases as reasoning heart becoming foolish desires
of the heart and reprobate mind prove Paul's concern for disposition and
inclination along with the doing or working of evil also see vv  
Even the catologues of vices are introdiced I Tim  or concluded I Cor
 by words describing what people are or were not what they do 
Habits betray what people are within as also the Lord Jesus taught cf Matt
  The inner condition is as important as the outer act one gives rise
to the other cf Mt 

     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too  Transvestism apparently
was accepted by the ancients   It was practiced among Canaaniteds Syrian
people of Asia Minor as well as Greeks according to SR Driver   Only a
few moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it  For example
Seneca Moral Epistles  condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an
adult slave to dress be beardless and behave as a woman  Philo also goes to
some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women
The Special Laws III   see also his On the Virtues  where he
justifies prohibition of crossdressing  Even the OT forbade the interchange
of clothing between the sexes  Deut 

     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the
new labels of natural and unnatural for sexual behavior  These did not
begin with Paul Rom  but go as far back as ancient Greece and even
nonChristian contemporaries used them  Plato the TESTNAPH Philo Josephu
Plutarch and others used these words or related concepts

disgrace such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the

Alan  E Alan Idler aidlersoluvicca writes

Alan   We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing Marvel
Alan not that I said unto thee Ye must be born again John 
Alan Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks to Nicodemus  a
Alan ruler of the Jews not a child

Yes but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement
in the same conversation

Flesh gives birth to flesh but the Spirit gives birth to spirit
John 

Clearly infants are not born of the spirit  Thus without baptism
they are unspiritual  They are not born with the image of God but in
Adam's fallen image cf Gen   They have no righteousness of
their own just as adults have no righteousness of their own  There
is only the imputed righteousness of Christ which believers receive
through faith

Alan   We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the
Alan concept of spiritual rebirth through baptism if newborn babies
Alan weren't free from sin

Your point is a little obscure here but I think you are saying
that Christ used the innocence of newborn babes as a metaphor
for spiritual rebirth  But this is not what he did
If you look at the text he did not speak
of spiritual rebirth but of spiritual birth  We are
born of the Spirit once not twice or several times
We are also born of the flesh once  The Lord makes it
clear that these are separate and different events
It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual
birth as rebirth because it is a second birth
for example Titus   But it is not a second
spiritual birth

The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth
which is used as a symbol of new life'  not of innocence  When an
infant is born or conceived a new life is begunbut it is neither
innocent nor righteous  Similarly when that same individual is
baptized or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism they begin a
new life in Christ Romans  Colossians  Titus  Ephesians
  Then the believer has God's assurance of the forgiveness of
their sins and of Christ's imputed righteousness

  Ok let me see if I can get all this out concisely  I am on an
information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of
Christianitychurches there are  
        My husband and I come from very different but completely
Christian backgrounds  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a
born and raised Church of Christ member  At first I agreed with a lot
of what the C of C was about I wanted to move from the liturgical
based Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based
However over the last year I've been regretting changing to the
Church of Christ for a number of reasons  for one thing I am not a
fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are
sociocultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine
One of my sorest spots is the role of women  I believe that through
Mary and other women Chris validated women as worthy disciples  but
in the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I
am told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser
member I am to submit to my husband in all things if I hear that
verse one more time and I am not to take an active role in
anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men
ie leading prayers conducting Bible studies etc   The last straw
was when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college
groups because it was allwomen and they wanted a man to lead the
study
Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church
feels that if you aren't a conservative republican  you aren't a REAL
Christian I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call
themselves a Christian  Hence we are subjected during the service to
long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with  We are
also don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new movement being
led by the young people

So we have been church hunting with NO success  I want a reasonably
biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter
what their calling  C of C really looked down on career women
Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious
convictions with adult baptism and a church where the members still
bring their Bibles to service

We are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a
place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and
without reservation  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be
thrilled
I'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and
even harder for me to stay churchless for long

any responses would be welcome


the diel family

I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what
you're looking for  However the issue is probably more one of the
flavor of the specific local churches in your area than the
denomination  Baptists cover quite a spectrum  Adult baptism sort
of narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum
Historically that's been associated with movements that have the
character you're trying to avoid  clh

 Recently an email to me mentioned

 Technically the messengers aren't even human so
 it can't be a case of homosexuality  even of rape 

 The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of
 the Sodomites' lust for the other flesh of angels  Again
 application to homosexual behavior in general or to the position of
 gay Christians is largeely specious
 
 Are angels flesh No I feel that this is saying that it was because
 of their lust after other men who are flesh or of this world

 what are other opinons on this I haven't heard much about this verse  
 at all

Bo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on James Peter and Jude points
out that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing
the elect from apostates not just the wicked in general  Hence those
who were delivered from Egypt but did not follow Moses and by extension
God the apostate angels and Sodom and Gomorrah  Quoting Reike

	Fornication may here as often in the New Testament
	refer to idolatry while flesh as in I Pet  
	denotes human society and its violent attempts at self
	exaltation  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders
	of apostasy and the surrounding cities correspond to
	their followers p 


There is no inherent reason to read this verse  as literally referring
to actual sexual lust for alien flesh  Nor is it inherently necessary
to understand it as referring to homosexuality outside of the circular
reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin
of homosexuality  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified and
not merely inferred is in Ezekiel  This was the guilt of your sister
Sodom she and her daughters had pride excess of food and prosperous ease
bit did not aid the poor and needy  They were haughty and did abominable
things before me therefore I removed them when I saw it

For the same reason overliteralizing the text your correspondent's
suggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexuality
is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly  There 
are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the
Sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se

Who is Ram Das

According to his brochures he is aka Richard Alpert PhD and is
somehow associated with the

  Seva Foundation
   N San Pedro Road
  San Rafael CA  

and the
  Hanuman Foundation 
   San Anselmo Ave 
  San Anselmo CA  

He speaks publically on such topics as Consciousness  Current
Events and has written some books and recorded some tapes on 
similar subjects  

Why do I care  My wife wants to go to one of his lectures  When
I asked why she said Ram Das was the greatest spiritual leader
of our time

Several years ago my wife got involved with a religious cult and
we went through  months of hell that almost ended our marriage 
before she quit  Let's just say I'm concerned about this Ram Das
and her interest especially so with the recent religious cult
events from Texas  I need information  solid and real  so I 
know what I'm dealing with

If you have any information about Ram Das or the organizations 
shown above I would be very interested in your correspondence
Please reply via email to me at  scotthpsddeSDDHPCOM

The dictionary of cults that I use classifies this as new age with
a basically Hindu orientation  The headquarters is or was when this
was written at that Lama Foundation which they identify as a New
Age Commune in San Cristobel New Mexico  For information you might
read Alpert's books which they list as Be Here Now an
autobiography The Only Dance There is and Grist for the Mill
It is dealt with briefly in a citation given as Larson New Book pp
 I assume this is Bob Larson Larson's New Book of Cults
I'd warn you however that the whole approach to the new age is
controversial  Sources such as the reference book I used as well as
Bob Larson believe in a Satanic new age conspiracy which some regard
as hysterical  However at the very least it seems clear that this is
not a Christian group  clh

Hello
I just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation
practice we do in my country  I am not sure if it is going on
also here in the US or any other country  In all these  
yrs I've been here in Illinois USA I have not encountered
it  May I just call it Traveling Fatima since I don't know
of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language

For certain regions in a district in a town or city an image
statue of our Lady of Fatima is moved from one home originating
from owner to another  This will stay with that family for
one  week and this family is required to pray the rosary and
other prayers prayer sheets accompany the image to our Lady
of Fatima  The move will be like a simple procession of folks
picking up the image from its current 'home' after 'departing'
prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the
prior notification about the move  There will be the 'receiving'
prayers at the next home to welcome our Lady of Fatima image
there  It does not have to be that only members of the family
in that home who must pray to the image  They may invite others
or othersfriends can invite themselves in  to participate
during prayer time in that 'new' home everyday for one week
This image is moved from one family to the next within the
bounded region of that district until it goes back to the owner
of the image

This is probably going on around there Philippines right now
or somebody correct me when exactly since I forgot and every
year this is part of our devotion to our Lady of Fatima

It has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more
likely that your next door neighbor is a Catholic and the image
then is just moved next door

I am thinking of starting something like it in the village where
my sister and her family lives  Most of our friends and neighbors
there are Catholics and practicing ones

I'd like to know if there are any statecommunity laws that this 
practice will violate whatsoever before I go for it  Thank you 
for any comments or help about this matter

It's not scriptural but comes from the patristic age I think
something about amare errantem interficere errorem which sounds
more like love the errant slay the error  No doubt someone else

 SAC Also we know that
 SAC the Bible says that everyone must be baptized to enter Heaven

Where exactly does it say that

 SAC Everyone includes infants unless there is other Scripture to the
 SAC contrary ie an exception  Since there is no exception listed in the
 SAC Bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the Bible means what
 SAC it says that everyone must be baptized to enter Heaven

I think we do see an exception in the case of Cornelius and his
household mentioned in Acts Of course they were baptised but only
after God showed that He accepted them by giving them the Holy
Spirit This means they were already acceptable to God before their
baptism and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven

In case that seems farfetched  an ancestor of mine was a missionary
who worked among the Hereros in Namibia Some of the tribesmen were
jealous of Christianity and they poisoned the first convert before he
could be baptised Surely he still went to heaven I'm inclined to
agree with a comment recorded at the time It is not the neglect of
baptism but its contempt that condemns

Just a quick comment  As a baptist clergyperson I find the idea
of such a baptism if the news report is in fact accurate and
they seldom are regarding religion offensive  The pastor here seems
to have a most unbaptist view of baptism one that seems to demand the
ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent

We do baptize converts but no one who has been deceived into hearing
the word is likely to be a convert  If in fact the grace of God might
work in such a situation there is no harm done in waiting a day or
two

Baptist believe in regenerate membership  Did this church include these
halfbaked at best converts into their church fellowship Or do they
somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose

This kind of evangelism is certainly not baptist and probably not
very christian either

 christian and if you have no intention of ever becoming one why on
 earth do you waste your time and mine by participating on a christian
 discussion list 

I don't think we should draw borders around newsgroups christians
are free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups and 
muslims are free to so so in other groups as well

It's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning 
postings The problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups
is the evangelistical method of telling that 'I am right and you are
wrong' This is true of both theists and atheists

Hopefully a more constructive dialogue between the groups 
would help concerning assumptions and colorization of views

Cheers

 in response to a question about why Jesus' parents would be sanctified 
beyond normal humanity

When Elizabeth greeted Mary Elizabeth said something to the effect that
Mary out of all women was blessed  If so it appears that this
exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity

I would think that simply being pregnant with the incarnation of the 
Almighty God would be enough to make Mary blessed among all women whether
or not she had special spiritual attributes  I find that the more special
Mary needs to be the less human Jesus gets

I find this remark to be awfully arrogant  I would venture to 
say that there are many people who are Christians now who at one
point in their lives had no intention of ever becoming a Christian
I was certainly one such person  I am quite thankful that there 
were Christians who were willing to continue to talk to me despite
the appearance that it might have been a waste of their time and 
mine  I even married one of them

Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks
you to give a reason for the hope that you have  But do this 
with gentleness and respect

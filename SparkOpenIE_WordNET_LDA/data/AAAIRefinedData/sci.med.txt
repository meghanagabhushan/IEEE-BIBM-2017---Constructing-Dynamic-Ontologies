I have a  yr old male friend misdiagnosed as having
 osteopporosis for two years who recently found out that his
 illness is the rare Gaucher's disease 

Gaucher's disease symptoms include brittle bones he lost  
 inches off his hieght enlarged liver and spleen internal
 bleeding and fatigue all the time The problem in Type  is
 attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the
 enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up
 This will eventually cause death

Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and
 approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients
 administered with this drug called Ceredase report a remarkable
 improvement in their condition Ceredase which is manufactured
 by biotech biggy companyGenzymecosts the patient 
 per year Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called the most
 expensive disease in the world

NEED INFO
I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying
 on netlanders to provide me with any additional information
news stories reports
people you know with this disease
ideas articles about Genzyme Corp how to get a hold of
   enough money to buy some programs available to help with
   costs
Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER

Thanks so very much

This wouldn't happen to be the same thing as chiggers would it
A truly awful parasitic affliction as I understand it  Tiny bugs
dig deeply into the skin burying themselves  Yuck  They have these
things in Oklahoma

Close My mother comes from Gainesville Tex right across the border
They claim to be the chigger capitol of the world and I believe them
When I grew up in Fort Worth it was bad enough but in Gainesville
in the summer an attack was guaranteed

In article Aprcsrochesteredu fulkcsrochesteredu Mark Fulk writes

Another uncommon problem is maternal hemorrhage  I don't remember the
incidence but it is something like  in  or  births  It is hard
to see how you could handle it at home and you wouldn't have very much time

thing you might consider is that people's risk tradeoffs vary  I consider
a  risk of loss of a loved one to require considerable effort in
the avoiding

Mark you seem to be terrified of the birth process

That's ridiculous

and unable to
believe that women's bodies are actually designed to do it

They aren't designed they evolved  And much as it discomforts us in
humans a troublefree birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and
cranial size  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do
Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time  To give you an idea
my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer greatgreat
grandfathers had several wives and we never could figure out which wife
had each child  One might ask why this happened  My greatgreat
grandfathers were by the time they reached their forties quite prosperous
farmers  Nonetheless they lost several wives each to the rigors of
childbirth the graveyards in Spencer Indiana and Boswell North Dakota
contain quite a few gravestones like Ida wf of Jacob Liptrap and
baby May  

You wanted
to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a
thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage

More like one in ten  And the consequences can be devastating I have
direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouledup breech birth

and now you want
all babies born in hospital based on a guess of how likely maternal
hemorrhage is and a false belief that it is fatal

It isn't always fatal  But it is often fatal when it happens out of
reach of adequate help  More often it permanently damages one's health

Clearly women's bodies evolved to give birth I am no believer in divine
design however evolution did not favor troublefree births for humans  

You have your kids where you want You encourage your wife to
get six inch holes cut through her stomach muscles expose herself
to anesthesia and infection and whatever other just in case measures
you think are necessary

My aren't we wroth  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack
in months  I can practically see your mouth foam

We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks  Although
I can't produce exact statistics  years after the last time we looked
them up rest assured that we balanced Csection risks against other risks
I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly
indicated on the other hand I am opposed on obvious grounds to waiting
until an emergency to give in

And bear this in mind my wife took the lead in all of these decisions
We talked things over and I did a lot of the leg work but the main
decisions were really hers

But I for one am bothered by your continued
suggestions especially to the misckidders pregnant for the first
time that birth is dangerous even fatal and that all these
unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing
it naturally

I don't know of very many home birth advocates even that think that
a firsttime mother should have her baby at home

I'm no Luddite I've had a section I'm planning a hospital birth
this time But for heaven's sake not everyone needs that

But people should bother to find out the relative risks  My wife was
unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings
In view of the intensity of the birth experience I doubt surroundings
have much importance anyway  Somehow the values you're advocating seem
all lopsided to me taking risks even if fairly small of serious
permanent harm in order to preserve something that is after all
an esthetic consideration

 Forget about total cholesterol when assessing health risk factors
 Instead use a relationship between LDL and HDL cholesterol
 
 If your LDL is       You need an HDL of at least
 
                        
                       
                       
                       
                       
                       

Gee what do I do  My LDL is only  and my HDL is only 
I must be risking something but Is it the same risk as those with 
very high LDL

 If your triglycerides are above  and your HDL is below  the
 drug of choice is gemfibrozil Lopid taken as a mg tablet
 thirty minutes before your morning and evening meals

What about exercise and a lowfat diet  What are the longterm 
effects of this drug

I have question that I hope is taken seriously despite the subject content

Problem  My long time girlfriend lately has not been initiating any sexual
	activity  For the last four months things have changed dramatically
       
	to make this shorter Summary nothing that I can think of has
				changed
       
She suggested we go to a sex counselor but I really don't want to just yet
Any suggestions would be appreciated
If you think you can help me please contact me by email for further info
PLEASE serious replies only
Thanks Larry

Larry

The subject content IS serious as is the question

On one hand you state that things have changed dramatically but at the
same time nothing you can think of has changed  Your girlfriend seems
to want to see a counselor but you don't  

I'd recommend that you examine your hesitation to see a counselor  It's
a very good environment to examine issues  

The fact of the matter is  your girlfriend has a different perception than
you  The TWO of you need to address the issue in order to resolve it

Please consider going to a counselor with your girlfriend  What could it
possibly hurt

 I have been taking prednisone mg twice a day for a while to control
 Ulcerative Colitis It seems like if I reduce the dosage the problem
 becomes worse At this point i see myself taking prednisone for a long
 long time perhaps for ever I was wondering about long term major side
 effects things like potential birth defects arthritis etc I have been
 putting on weight my face looks puffed and round experience sudden mood
 swings As I understand these are all short term

I second what Spenser Aden said in reply  Additionally it is hard to say
what type of response you are having to prednisone since you did not say
how long you have been on it  Patients are generally kept on steroids for
months before thinking about tapering  Alternatives to daily dosing are 
every other day dosing in your case mg every other day would be a start
Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start
azathioprine  Like Spenser said you should generally be on another drug
in addition to your prednisone like asulfidine  A lot of the specifics
about options though depends on severity location and duration of 
disease as well as histology so take advice off the net for what it
is worth  

I treat patients with UC and Crohn's  An educated patient is a good 
patient but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things
can be put in context  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and
Colitis Foundation of America   office  
info hotline

Best of Luck to you

Are there any case histories of severe mental illness cases remarkably
recovering after a tragic accident or trauma eg through nobody's fault
being trapped in a fire and losing your legs say
 
I know of a patient who was severely and chronically depressed and tried
to kill himself with a bullet to the temple  He essentially gave
himself a prefrontal lobotomy curing the depression

How long does it take a smoker's lungs to clear of the tar after quitting 
Does your chances of getting lung cancer decrease quickly or does it take
a considerable amount of time for that to happen

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without
doing a lot of autopsies  The second question is something that's been
known for some time  It appears that within about  years of quitting
smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the
person who never smoked assuming you do not get lung cancer in the
interim  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per
day for  years is around  times as high as a nonsmoker  Still
rather low overall but significant  Personally I'd be more concerned
about heart disease secondary to smoking  it's much more common and
even a small increase in risk is significant there

Unfortunately it was rather poorly researched and would not be available
today if it were just invented  Keep in mind however that those were
the days when a bottle of Coca Cola really did contain coca extract and
a certain amount of active cocaine  Times have changed and our attitudes
need to change with them
 Well yes  That was a part of my point  Aspirin has its problems but
in some situations it is useful  Ditto stuff like licorice root  Taking
anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea
of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted
additional effects  Taking any drug when the potential illeffects are
not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved and it may be that
in a given situation the risk is worthwhile
   Like Prozac for instance Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in
some cases where the tricyclics fail  But Prozac hasn't been in use
that long and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have
when taken over long periods of time even though it has been tested
by present day standards  Should Prozac be taken off the market because
longterm effects if any are not known  IMHO i'd say no

Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like
this  I of course don't know the exact situation and
antidepressants may work but it isn't helping the ringing at all is it


The ringing started rather suddenly about  months ago  She is quickly losing
sleep social life and sanity over this

Mine started about three years back  Turns out I have tinnitus
bilateral translation ringing in both ears basically   If this
is what it is she'll probably get used to it  It would keep me up
and drive me nuts too but nowadays I have to plug both my ears with
my fingers to check to see if they are ringing  Usually they are but
you get so used to it it just gets tuned out  Yes this is what I've
read about it not just from my own personal experience


Does anyone know of any treatments for this  Any experience  Coping
mechanisms  Any opinions on the antidepressant drugs

Millions have it according to my physician  You just learn to cope
with it like I mentioned earlier by ignoring it  It eventually
becomes unconscious

The doc also said it could be caused by diet ie too much caffeine
and stress but I haven't changed my lifestyle much and it just comes
and goes it is always there somewhat but now I rarely notice it when
it really kicks in

Also it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss either
caused by it or causing it  I had an ENT earnosethroat exam and
passed  In fact my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as
good of care of my hearing as I should

Her reaction is normal  If it is tinnitus chances are good she'll
begin to not even notice it  

This info is taken mostly from a few experts my own experience and
some readings sorry it was a few years back and don't have any
specifics handy

A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has
emphysema  His lung capacity has decreased over time  His father died
of the disease  He works in woodworking  I believe he has a very
occasional cigarette perhaps one cigarette a day or even less  He tells
me thisI've never seen him light up  He has some pretty healthy
life style habits good diet exercise meditation retreats therapy
etc  Anyhowhe is very concerned with this check up  I know really
nothing about the disease  I believe it interferes with the lining
of the lung being able to exchange oxygen  

Is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence  If he were to give up smoking
entirely would that better his chances for recovery  What are some 
modern therapies used in people with this disease  I would appreciate 
any information  Thanks  amigancupportalcom

DN From nyedacnsvaxuwecedu David Nye
DN A neurology
DN consultation is cheaper than a scan

And also better because a neurologist can make a differential
diagnosis between migraine tensiontype headache cluster benign
intracranial hypertension chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and other
headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan  A neurologist
can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the
diagnosis

DN Also since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other
DN serious pathology it may be cheaper to just get a CT scan then have
DN them come into the ER every few weeks
DN And easier than taking the time to reassure the patient right
DN Personally I don't think this can ever be justified

Sigh  It may never be justifiable but I sometimes do it  Even
after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history neurologic
examination and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis
salted with lots of reassurance patients still ask why can't you
order a scan so we can be absolutely sure  Aunt Millie often gets
into the conversation as in they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches
for years and then she died of a brain tumor aneurysm or
whatever  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a
patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome I'd like to hear
what your magic is

Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG
Mind you I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor
but the patient feels like something is being done as if the
hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were
nothing the EEG has no ionizing radiation it's much cheaper
than CT or MRI and the EEG brings in some money to my department

JL From jlecherpbsorg
JL  I would not classify a mild headache that was continuous for weeks
JL  as migraine even if the other typical features were there eg
JL  unilateral nausea and vomiting photophobia  Migraines are by
JL  common agreement episodic rather than constant
JL 
JL Well I'm glad that you aren't my doctor then or I'd still be suffering
JL Remember I was tested for any other cause and there was nothing I'm
JL otherwise very healthy
JL The nagging pain has all of the qualifications it's on one side and
JL frequently included my entire right side right arm right leg right eye
JL even the right side of my tongue hurt or tingled Noise hurt light hurt
JL thinking hurt When it got bad I would lose my ability to read

The differential diagnosis between migraine and nonmigranous pain
is not always important because some therapies are effective in
both eg tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen  Other
therapies may be more specific betablockers such as propranolol
work better in migraine than tensiontype headache

The most important thing from your perspective is that you got
relief  Also please understand that a diagnosis other than
migraine does not necessarily mean psychogenic I suspect that
organic factors play as large a role in tensiontype headache as in
migraine

	A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically
every few months for the last  years  An episode begins with extreme
tiredness followed by

	 traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows
	knees and hips
	 generalized muscle pains
	 tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears
	 severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day
	 hemorrhaging in both eyes  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral
   retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy  She
        isn't diabeticthey checked
	 distorted color vision and distorted vision in general telephone
	   poles do not appear to be straight
	 loss of peripheral vision
 	
	Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something 
called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain  The only
thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone  At
times she had been on  mg per day  Whenever she gets down to  mg
the symptoms become acute again

	She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming
worse with each episode and her vision is suffering  None of the docs she
has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop
it  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated Thanks in 
advance  Kathy Turner

Gordon your experience is valid for many but not all  The
fact that you know a few people who have been overweight and are
now stable at a lower normal or just less weight does not
contradict the observation that only  per cent can maintain
ideal weight with current technology

Actually the observation is that only  of those who seek help
from your socalled diet evangelists can maintain their weight  I
happen to agree with Keith Lynch that there are many people who can
and do lose weight on their own and who are not reflected in the
dismal failure rate that is often quoted

Wasn't there a study where a researcher asked a more general population
perhaps some part of a university community about weight loss and heshe
found that a much higher percentage had lost and maintained 

In fact Adiposity  mentions a similar study search for life
events in any recent version of Adiposity 

The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have
lost weight and kept it off is that we don't know what caused
the weight gain in the first place  This is critical because
someone who gains weight because of something temporary drug
effect life event etc may appear successful at dieting when
the weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary
condition that caused the weight gain

Getting back to the original question in this thread

I experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those
described  In my case it turned out that I was developing Type I
diabetes  Although I never sought direct confirmation of this from my
doctor I think that the breathing problem was associated with the
presence of ketones due to the diabetes

I think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting
their food intake drastically  I don't know if this relevant in this
case but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating
properly

 a friend of mine has a very severe cause of jiggers 
 for over a year now  they cause him a lot of pain

 i recently read i don't know where about a possible
 cure for jiggers  does anyone have any information on
 this  i can't remember the name of the treatment or
 where i read it


I'll probably get flamed for this but when I was a kid we would go to
my uncles cabin on Middle Bass Island on Lake Erie We always came home
with a nasty case of jiggers large red bumps where the buggers had
burrowed into the skin My mother would paint the bumps with clear
finger nail polish This was repeated daily for about a week or so The
application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of
the skin All I can say is it worked for us One word of caution
though Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell

If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me
toast

My yo son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose  I
bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment  I think that is probably
enough along with the usual good diet  However he is on at me to
get some product called Dalacin T which used to be a
doctor'sprescription only treatment but is not available over the
chemist's counter  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say
either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T or that Clearasil
is OK  I had the odd spots as a teenager nothing serious  His
father was the same so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate
into something disfiguring  But I know kids are senstitive about
their appearance  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd
malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from
acne treatment  I want to help  but with appropriate treatment

My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp  Sort
of teenage cradle cap  Any pointersadvice on this  We have tried a
couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to
make the condition worse not better

Shall I bury the kid till he's

 can I prevent it from occuring in such short time  Is there a cleanser out
 there that will do a better job  that is after cleaning my face won't become
 oily in such a short time
 
 	Thank you for any suggestion
 
if this is a disease everyone should have it  My skin has always been oily

i am now  yrs old and my skin looks younger i'm told than some people's
skin at  it's still oily  i have only a very few tiny wrinkles  Thank

A very simple question  it seems to me that the contraceptive
pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to
fall every month But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the 
ovule Is it true  If yes is there a risk of extrauterine
pregnancy that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian
tube

Thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question  The
final diagnosis was Stress  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment
Rachel receives all her medical care at Keller Army Hospital since she is a
military dependant and the Army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments
as part of its regular health care  I am hoping that the arrival of 
Spring Break and  College Acceptance Letters will help  UNFORTUNATELY
she was waitlisted at the college she most dearly wanted to attend so it
seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while  

Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for
spring break which seems like a good stressreliever to me

It's got potential  Instead of chemistry how about splitting the
classification into biochemistry which are probably the topics
you're thinking of and pharmaceutical which otherwise might end up
in biochemistry

This is separate from the issue of whether there is sufficient potential
news volume to support either or both groups

Vida Can one develop innerear problems from too much flying  I hear
Vida that pilots and stewardesses have a limit as to the maximum
Vida number of flying hours  what are these limits  What are the
Vida main problems associated with too many longhaul over  hours
Vida trips

The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue  The cockpit
crew pilot limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew
limits for this reason  Crew rest requirements address amount of time
on duty plus rest time  A tired crew is an accidentprone crew

The only limits I know of for innerear problems are in military
aircraft which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably
pressurized  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members
DNIF duties not involving flying or grounded until the ears clear

Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear  If you don't have
big pressure changes you may not know that you've got a problem  But
if you zip up to  or  ft the usual cabin altitude in an
airliner and then back down to sea level you may discover a problem
Ears don't clear readily because of allergies colds infections and
anatomical problems  The last won't change the first three can
Medication decongestants or antihistimines usually can help
Chewing gum sucking hard candy or a bottle for babies
yawningthese will help all four causes

Actually that is not how the pill works but it is how the IUD works
The oral contraceptive pill actually prevents ovulation from occuring
by providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland and thus preventing
the LH surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation  With the IUD
what happens is that fertilization may occur but the device prevents
implantation within the wall of the uterus not the vagina

 This is regarding recurrent volvulus which our little boy
 has been suffering from ever since he was an infant He had
 a surgery when he was one year old Another surgery had
 to be performed one year after when he was two years old
 He turned three this February and he is still getting
 afflicted by this illness like having to get hospitalised
 for vomitting and accompanying stomach painHe managed
 not having a third surgery so far
 
   	One thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction
 	peaks around the time he was born on nearabouts like in
 	March every year  Any significance to this
 
 	Why does this recur Me and my family go through severe pain
 	when our little boy have to undergo surgery Why does surgery
 	not rectify the situation 
 
 	Also which hospital in US or Canada specialize in this malady
 
 	What will be a good book explaining this disease in detail
 
 	Will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of 
 	recurrence
 
 	As time goes on will the probability of recurrence go down
 	considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably
 	less prone to attacks Or is this assumption wrong
 
 	Any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated
 	Thanks very much

mg per day of propranolol is a homeopathic dose in migraine

tolerate enough beta blocker to help you  

If we go the antidepressant route what is it likely to be  How do
antidepressants work in migraine prophylaxis


Probably a single nightime dose  We don't know how they work in migraine but
it probably has something to do with seratonin

Too bad since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patients
and they don't do any good flushed down the toilet  I suspect
we'll be moving those patients more and more to the DHE nasal

How long ago was this  When I said you'd get counselling I meant if
you did it now  Long ago practices varied and agencies had to gear
up to provide the counselling

a wife and a fouryearold son  Many people have suggested that his wife
should sue the Red Cross but she would not  She says that without the
blood transfusions he would have died during the surgery


Good for her  What we don't need is everyone suing community service
agencies that provide blood that people need  Testing is not fool proof
The fact that he got AIDS from a transfusion if he really did does
not mean the Red Cross screwed up  Prior to  or so there wasn't
a good test and a lot of bad blood got through  This wasn't the fault
of the Red Cross  When did he get the transfusions

This is my first post and I am not even sure it will work Here goes

Did anyone read the editorial on page  in the  march  edition of Time
Magazine noting that managed care is extremely inefficient  Of all the possible
clients that Billary could be pandering to the insurance industry is the worst

Comments
 
I agree Adding layers of managers and bureaucrats simply eat up
money that could be spent on those who actually are doing the work
such as doctors and nurse and supplies  The most efficient system
is probably one that has limited management and a fixed budget such
as England's or even Canada's  I'm afraid we are on the wrong
track  The problem may be that the insurance lobby is too powerful

I would like to know if there is any new information out there about the
subject or any new studies being conducted  I am confident in my
pediatrician and her communication with the people in Chapel Hill but
since this is a lifelong disorder and genetically transferred I would
like keep current  I do realize that since this is a relatively new
disorder first documented in  in a fertility clinic in Scandanavia
and is therefore controversial

I do not know a lot about this except from seeing one patient with
Kartagener's syndrome which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome
in which there is situs inversus bronchiectasis and chronic
infections Situs inversus means that organs are on the wrong
side of the body and can be complete or partial It is interesting
medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part
by the normal rotation associated with ciliary motion so that in
absence of this laterality can be random People with situs
inversus are quite popular at medical schools because of their
rarity and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they
can't find the patient's heart sounds because they're on the wrong
side 

According to Harrison's immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal
recessive which should imply that on average one child in four
in a family would be affected But there may be much more current
information on this and as usual in medicine we may be talking
about more than one conditiion I would suggest that you ask your
pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist of
which there is probably one at NCSU

Can anyone out there enlighten me on the relationship between
lung disorders and clubbing or swelling and widening of the
fingertips  What is the mechanism and why would a physician
call for chest xrays to diagnose the cause of the clubbing

Purists often distinguish between true clubbing and pseudo
clubbing the difference being that with true clubbing the
angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly
negative when proceeding distally towards the fingertip
With pseudo clubbing the angle is initially positive then
negative which is the normal situation Real internists
can talk for hours about clubbing I'm limited to a couple
of minutes

Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is
entirely unclear but it is one of those things that internists
love to paw over during rounds Supposedly only true clubbing
is associated with disease The problem is that the list of
diseases associated with clubbing is quite long and includes
both congenital conditions and acquired disease Since many of
these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems
leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia it is
very reasonable to get a chest xray However many of the 
congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac
catheterization 

The cause of clubbing is unclear but presumably relates to
some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to
dilate abnormally 

Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is
a tipoff to do more extensive examination Often however
the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent

There are many organisms viral bacterial and fungal which can
cause meningitits and the course of these infections varies
widely The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age in adults
pneumococcus the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia
is the most common cause while in children Hemophilus influenzae
is the most common cause

What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis
which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in
both groups but with lower incidence in infants This organism
is also called the meningococcus and is the source of the
common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in
the press Without prompt treatment and even WITH it in some cases
the organism typically causes death within a day 

This organism feared as it is is actually grown from the throats
of many normal adults It can get to the meninges by different
ways but blood borne spread is probably the usual case 

Rifampin an oral antibiotic is often given to family and contacts
of a case of meningococcal meningitis by the way

Sorry but I don't have time for a more detailed reply Meningitis
is a huge topic and scimed can't do it justice

Well it is tragic what has happened to you but it doesn't

Prostate CA is an especially troublesome entity for chiropractors

is highly dangerous since it can then fracture  I've seen at

No the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common
forms of meningitis  It's the one that sometimes sweeps
schools or boot camp  It is contagious and kills by attacking
the covering of the brain causing the blood vessels to thrombose
and the brain to swell up

It is very treatable if caught in time  There isn't much time
however  The rash is the tip off  Infants are very susceptible
to dying from bacterial meningitis  Any infant with a fever who
becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where
a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis  Seizures can also
occur

Immediate family members were told to take some kind of medication
to prevent them from being carriers yet they didn't have
any concerns about my wife and I coming to visit them


It can live in the throat of carriers  Don't worry you won't get 
it from them especially if they took the medication

I think it is important to verify all procedures with proper studies to
show their worthiness and risk  I just read an interesting tidbit that 
 of the medical treatments are unproven and not based on scientific 
fact  For example many treatments of prostate cancer are unproven and
the treatment may be more dangerous than the disease according to the
article I read

Where did you read this  I don't think this is true  I think most
medical treatments are based on science although it is difficult
to prove anything with certitude  It is true that there are some
things that have just been found to work but we have no good
explanation for why  But almost everything does have a scientific
rationale  The most common treatment for prostate cancer is
probably hormone therapy  It has been proven to work  So have
radiation and chemotherapy  What treatments did the article say
are not proven

Summary Headaches and analgesics

I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly
motrin at the time I seemed to get a lot of migraines  But had
forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here
I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches because I've
found them to be ineffective  However I have two other pain sources
that force me to take NSAIDS currently Naprosyn  First is some
pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period and then much
worse at midcycle  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past
 years ago so the Drs tell me that my pain is probably due
to the endometriosis coming back  I've tried Synarel it reduced
the pain while I took it  mos but the pain returned immediately
after I stopped  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the
only real solution to my problem  Although I don't expect to have
any more children I don't like the idea of having my uterus and
one remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when I had
the surgery for endometriosis  One of the Drs that suggested
I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks
that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan
to have children  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out
the pain  This would be impossible without Naprosyn or something
similar  but not aspirin that doesn't work and Motrin gave me
horrible gastritis a few years ago so I'm through with it  In
fact Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take
it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain and pain in both 
legs as I'll discuss in a moment  Generally though I wait until
I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn but then it takes
several hours for it reduce the pain it's actually quite effective
at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while  In the meantime
I'm frequently in severe pain

The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in
bilateral radiculopathy  I've had MRIs Xrays CT scan and EMGs
I've had  of them and don't intend to ever do that again with
nerve conduction tests  The tests have not been conclusive as to
what is causing my back and leg pain  The MRI reports both say I have
several bulging degeneratig disks and from the Xrays and MRI I think
it is apparent that I have arthritis  The reading on the CT scan
was that there are two herniations LL and LL but others
hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations
The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation
compared to the first EMG  Oh yeah I had some other horrible test
called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the
internal nerves are working fine   Anyway the bottom line is that
I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain  The back pain
is there all the time but I can live with it  When the leg pain is there
I need some analgesicantiinflammatory medication to reduce the pain
to a level where I can work  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 
months every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse so I'd 
always resume  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently
and primarily for the pelvic pain  I have been going to physical
therapy for the last  months  times a week  After the first month
or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier
but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at
a lower weight  After a month or two the pain in my legs began going
away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which
could be reduced with ultrasound and massage  So now I don't have
nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off
traction about  weeks ago

Getting back to my original reason for this post  Even if I can avoid
taking analgesic for headaches I really can't avoid them entirely because
I have other pain sources that force me to use them Oh I forgot
to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery
but I'm avoiding that too  I find the migraines difficult to deal with
occassionally I have to take off work but usually I can work but at
a reduced capacity I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading
and writing  When the pelvic pain is bad I can't concentrate much
I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because
the pain is so bothersome  When the pain in my back is bad it can
cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric
shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad
I can't really sit at all  Then I end up spending most of my time home
and in bed  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the
migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources  I get a lot
of migraines an average of  to  a month which last  days
I've taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so
I reduced the dosage but I don't like the side effects if I take
more than two I get diahrea  If I get a very bad headache I will
eventually take the cafergot  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when
I told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan
becomes available I should try that  I've tried several other medications
fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but
they either didn't work or I couldn't tolerate them  So what can I do
My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the
pain which I agree with most of the time but not when I have a lot of
pain  I've had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped
once from the anesthesia  I was told that it was likely the
succinylcholine and I've already had surgery several times

Anyway the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute
to migraines some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain

My yo son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose  I
bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment  I think that is probably
enough along with the usual good diet  However he is on at me to
get some product called Dalacin T which used to be a
doctor'sprescription only treatment but is not available over the
chemist's counter  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say
either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T or that Clearasil
is OK  I had the odd spots as a teenager nothing serious  His
father was the same so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate
into something disfiguring  But I know kids are senstitive about
their appearance  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd
malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from
acne treatment  I want to help  but with appropriate treatment

My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp  Sort
of teenage cradle cap  Any pointersadvice on this  We have tried a
couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to
make the condition worse not better

Shall I bury the kid till he's  

 NoI was one of the lucky ones Very little acne as a teenager I
didn't have any luck with clearasil Even though my skin gets oily it
really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry 

Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help Getting the scalp
thing under control might help that could be as simple as submerging under
the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out Taking a one a day
vitaminmineral might help I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  
is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be
where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from I notice grease 
on my face not immediately removed will cause acne even from eating
meat

Keeping hair rinse mousse dip and spray off the face will help Warm
water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will
help prevent blackheads Body oil is hydrophilic loves water and it
softens and washes off when it has a chance That's why hair goes limp with
oilyness 

Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with
a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery Any
prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections the red spots of
pimples Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't
be an infection afterwards

Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry
makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an
incredible defect to be hidden at any cost even that of causing more pimples

A  Folks do we have an FAQ on tinnitus yet

B  As a loooong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist
who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following
are reasonable conclusions

 Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus
 The cause it not understood
 There is no accepted treatment that cures it
 Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit but
there have be no reportseven anecdotalof massive good results with
any of these experimental drugs
 Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep
 Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes
abates or goes away after a few months
 Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people
 There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US
 One usually gets used to it  Especially when concentrating on
something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed
  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying sometimes
  I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure but there
is not

I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers a type of
mite indigenous to the south but I certainly have spent a lot
of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years
since we moved to NC  Here are some observations gained from
painful experience

   Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person
     Some people get tiny red bites  Others like me are more
     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sorelike affairs

   Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving  I swear
     that these things will itch for months

   There is a lot of folklore about chiggers  I think most of
     it is fiction  I have tried to do research on the critters
     since they have such an effect on me  The only book I could
     find on the subject was a single book in UNC's special
     collections library  I have not yet gone through what is
     required to get it

   Based on my experience and that of my family members the old
     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work  I recall
     reading that the theory upon which it is based that the chiggers
     burrow into your skin and continue to party there is false  I
     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some
     sort the little pests release  But this is speculation

   The best approach is prevention  A couple of things work well
     A good insect repellent DEET such as Deep Woods Off liberally
     applied to ankles waistband etc is a good start  There is
     another preparation called Chig Away that is a combination of
     sulfur and some kind of cream cortisone that originally was
     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available  In
     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get
     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we
     live in the country without serious consequences  They
     apparently don't like sulfur much at all  You can use sulfur
     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them

   No amount of prevention will be completely successful  Forget
     the fingernail polish  I have finally settled upon a treatment
     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone
     creme reduces the inflamation and swelling and benzocaine
     relieves the itch  I won't tell you all the things I've tried
     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this
     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned I also think
     it gains nothing

   The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved
     by the application of hot packs and this seems to speed recovery
     as well

Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers  The urban and suburban
doctors apparently don't encounter them much  And the rural doctors
seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure  I
suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers
would make a lot of money

On the other hand we do a good job of implying that the person who
weighs lbs is overeating when in fact the body probably doesn't
make any moral judgements about its composition  Conceivably the 
body works just as hard maintaining its weight at  as someone else's
does at 


Undoubtedly it does to maintain such a weight  And it does so
primarily by overeating  If it didn't the weight would drop
back to normal

Yes I remember that now  Well in that case the cones are indeed

Two approaches that I've used Tofranil  mg qhs Naproxen mg bid
The Naproxen doesn't seem to be as bad as things like Tylenol in promoting
the analgesic abuse Headache  DHE IV infusions for about  days in

I was wondering what steps are being taken to prevent the spread of
multidrug resistant tuberculosis  I've heard that some places are
thinking of incarcerating those with the disease  Doesn't this violate
the civil rights of these individuals  Are there any legal precedents
for such action


Who knows in this legal climate but there is tremendous legal precendent
for forcibly quarantining TB patients in sanitariums   yrs ago
it was done all the time  It has been done sporadically all along
in patients who won't take their medicine  If you have TB you
may find yourself under surveilence of the Public Health Department
and you may find they have the legal power to insist you make your
clinic visits

My biggest resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like most
people with dizziness can be cured  That's definitely not the
case  In most cases like I said above it is a long tedious
process that may or may not end up in a partial cure  


Be sure to say chronic dizziness not just dizziness  Most
patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better
The vertiginous spells of Meniere's will also eventually go
away however the patient is left with a deaf ear


To anyone suffering with vertigo dizziness or any variation
thereof my best advice to you as a fellowsufferer is this
just keep searchingdon't let the doctors tell you there's
nothing that can be donedo your own researchand let your

This may have helped you but I'm not sure it is good general
advice  The odds that you are going to find some miracle with
your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge
for this or any other disease are slim  When good answers to these
problems are found it is usually in all the newspapers  Until
then spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical
problem may divert that energy from more productive things
in life  A limited amount should be spent to assure yourself
that your doctor gave you the correct story but after it becomes
clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine
has no good solution perhaps the best strategy is to join
the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to
make a career out of it

stool blood and an open ulcer for treatment The idea was that the guy was a
walking public health risk and that forcing him to receive IV antibiotics for
a few days was in the public interest I will make a long story short by saying
that the judge laughed at my idea yelled at me for wasting his time and let
the guy go

I found out that tuberculosis appears to be the only MEDICAL as oppsed to psychiatric
condition that one can be committed for and this is because very specific laws were
enacted many years ago regarding tb I am certain these vary from state to state

Also I'm not sure that physician fees at the very very highest levels
don't have to come down I'm not talking about the bulk of physicians
making good but not great salaries who have megaloans from medical school
debts I'd also like to see some strong ethics with teeth for physicians

I agree that some specialties have gotten way out of line  The main
problem is the payment method for procedures rather than time distorts
the system  I hope they will fix that  But I'm afraid as usual
the local doc is going to take the brunt  People grouse about paying
 to see their home doctor in his office but don't mind paying
 to have brain surgery  They think their local doc is cheating
them but worship the feet of the neurosurgeon who saved their life
What they don't realize is that we need more local docs and fewer

 How dangerous is it  From whom is it especially dangerous 

Dangerous only to immune suppressed persons and fetuses  To them
it is extremely dangerous  Most of the rest of us have already had
it and it isn't dangerous at all

 How is it transmitted I read about raw meat and cats but I'd like to
   have more details 

Cat feces are the worst  Pregnant women should never touch the litter box

 What can be done to prevent infection 

Cook your meat  Watch it with pets

 What are the symptoms and longterm effects 

You'll have to read up on it  

 What treatments are availble 


There is an effective antibiotic that can keep it in check
Of course it can't reverse damage already done such as in
a fetus

Hmmmm here's one place where I really think the patient ought to take more
responsibility for him or herself  There is absolutely no reason why you
can't ask the pharmacist filling the prescription for the Physicians' Package
Insert for the medication when you pick it up at the pharmacy  Make sure to
tell the pharmacist that you want the Physicians' Package Insert NOT the

If people are going to do this I really wish they would tell me first
I'd be happy to go over the insert in the PDR with them and explain
everything  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then
on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug
and we are starting over again at square one  Some of them probably
didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit
they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or
something  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they
report every adverse side effect ever reported without substantiating
that the drug was responsible  The insert is a legal document to slough
liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to
happen  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information
on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the
AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific
There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking
Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks
to themselves properly  I'm sure Herman is going to go ballistic
but so be it  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been
reported to cause impotence  Half the males who read that will falsely assume
it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will
refuse to take any drug like that  This can be a real problem for
PDR readers  There needs to be some way of providing patients with
tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need
I am involved in a research project to do that with migraine as the
domain  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions
about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient
For common illnesses such as migraine and hypertension this may help
quite a bit  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the
computer and this would then not burden the physician  Clearly
physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have
as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked
things that the patients should have found out from their physician
but didn't  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either
Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask  They won't be as afraid to
ask the system we hope

Multiple drug resistance in TB is a relatively new phenomenon and
one of the largest contributing factors is that people are no longer
as scared of TB as they were before antibiotics  It was roughly as
feared as HIV is now


Not that new   years ago we had drug addicts harboring active TB
that was resistant to everything in Chicago  The difference now
is that such strains have become virulent  In the old days such
TB was weak  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just
infected the one person in whom it developed because of noncompliance
with medications  Noncompliance and development of resistant strains
has been a problem for a very long time  That is why we have like 
drugs against TB  There is always a need to develop new ones due to
such strains  Now however with a virulent resistant strain we
are in more trouble and measures to assure compliance may be necessary
even if they entail force

The speculum is the little cone that fits on the end of the otoscope
There are also vaginal specula that females and gynecologists are
all too familiar with

In fairness we should note that if you look up speculum in the
dictionary which I did when this question first surfaced the first
definition is a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in
optical instruments

Which doesn't mean the name fits in this context but it's not as far

 the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common

the covering of the brain causing the blood vessels to thrombose
and the brain to swell up

	

It can live in the throat of carriers  Don't worry you won't get 
it from them especially if they took the medication

Assuming one has been cultured as having a throat laden with
neiseria meningococcus and given and taken a course of ERYC 
without the culture becoming negative should one worry about
being a carrier

 Explain  I thought there were  types of cones equivalent to RGB

You're basically right but I think there are just  types  One is
sensitive to red and green and the other is sensitive to blue and yellow 
This is why the two most common kinds of colorblindness are redgreen and
blueyellow


Yes I remember that now  Well in that case the cones are indeed
color sensitive contrary to what the original respondent had claimed


	I'm not sure who the original respondent was but to
reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum just
as rods respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum bluegreen
in our case reddish in certain amphibia just as the hoseshoe crab
Limulus polyphemus photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of
the spectrum etc  It is a common misconception to confound wavelength
specificity with being color sensitive however the two are not
synonymous
	So in sum and to beat a dead horse
	 When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of
absorbed photons irrespective of the absorbed photons wavelength
the cone outputs are indistinguishable
	 Cones are simply detectors with different spectral
sensitivities and are not any more color sensitive than are rods
ommatidia or other photoreceptors
	 Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which
sample different parts of the spectrum cones in this case are
processed centrally  The handwave is intentional

	I've worked and published research on rods and cones for over
 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can detect color
is frustrating  But don't take my word for it  I'm reposting a few
excellent articles together with two rather good but oldish color
vision texts

living donors and I'm sure they've published  



The case report of the first xenotransplant was published in Lancet

There was  another paper sort of a tour of the horizon written by Starzl and
published in the Resident's Edition of the Annals of Surgery vol  October 
It's in the Surgical Resident's Newsletter section so you won't find it in the regular
issue of the Annals I don't have any reprints of that one
A paper has been accepted for publication by Immunology Today though I'm not sure
when it's coming out describing our experience with the two xenografts done to date


As for segmental liver transplants from living related donors I must confess to a total
ignorance of that literature We are philosophically opposed to those and I don't keep

           THE SEASALT  SODA BATH  Please keep an OPEN MIND
               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level 
          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in  
          Immerse yourself in it for a minute and then completely 
          dissolve in the bath water  pound of SUNevaporated SEAsalt 
          regular salt won't work and  pound of fresh bakingsoda 
               Soak in this bath for  to  minutes while exercising 
          your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your 
          stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down 
          chomping your teeth together etc 
               Among other things the SEAsalt  Soda Bath neutralizes 
          the accumulated effects of Xrays etc as described in the 
          book Born To Be Magnetic Vol  by Frances Nixon  
               PRECAUTIONS Only the ONE person using each bath should 
          prepare it and drain it
          For at least  minutes after taking the bath stay away 
          from and even out of sight of other people  Your greatly 
          expanded Aura energyfield during that time could disrupt 
          other people's fields  Two hours after the bath eat at 
          least  ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures  
          The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also  Better yet take 
          a Billionbacteria Acidophilus capsule which is also an 
          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF AIDS 
          because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the 
          digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune 
          system  Because this external bath can kill INternal 
          bacteria it may also be a CURE for Lyme disease
          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder 
          storm within  days of a full moon nor during Major or 
          Minor Periods as listed in the Solunar Tables published 
          bimonthly in Field  Stream Magazine because of the 
          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energyfields 
          present at those times
          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year 
       
           MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTICANCER REMEDIES 
       
               For skin cancer apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the 
               affected skin twice daily and take  to  tablespoons 
               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally for 
               about  months 
        
               DMSO Dimethyl Sulfoxide causes cancer cells to 
               perform NORMAL cell functions 

               ALMONDS UNblanched UNroasted CONTAIN LAETRILE  
               To help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day  
               To help cure cancer eat several OUNCES of almonds per 
               day
               NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally  
               IT WILL KILL YOU  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY  Cancer 
               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile 
               into cyanide which then kills the cell  This enzyme is 
               ALSO present in the digestive system 

               ANTIOXIDANTS are FREERADICAL SCAVENGERS and include 
               Vitamin E Selenium  mcg per day is safe for most 
               people Chromium up to  mcg per day Vitamin A 
                IU per day is safe for most people Superoxide 
               Dismutase up to  Units per day Vitamin C up 
               to  mg per day and BHT Butylated Hydroxy
               toluene  to  capsules of BHT every night at bedtime 
               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES BOTH types 
               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes 
               prevent spreading herpes to other people but will not 
               cure herpes  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST 
               AIDS which is really a form of cancer similar to 
               leukemia  See the book Life Extension by Durk 
               Pearson and Sandy Shaw 

               HYDROGENPEROXIDE  Dilute twelve drops of  
               hydrogenperoxide in a glass of pure water preferably 
               DISTILLED and drink it  Do this once or twice per day 
               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else  
               Apply  hydrogenperoxide directly to skin cancers 
               several times per day
               Use hydrogenperoxide ONLY if you are taking a good 
               daily dose of some of the various antioxidants 
               described above 

               VITAMIN  MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective and 
               much less expensive when COMBINED together in MEGA 
               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources 

               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong  Maxwell 
               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD especially if it is pulsating on 
               and off  A strong south magnetic field is an 
               aphrodisiac  In my opinion ALL types of ionizing
               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with 
               daily minute doses of pulsating Maxwell NORTH 
               magnetic fields 

               Properly made and operated RADIONICSPSIONICS MACHINES 
               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well 
               as most other medical problems  Some RadionicsPsionics 
               Machines can even take crosssectional Xraylike photos 
               of cancer tumors etc withOUT Xrays 

               INTERFERON tablets

               TAHEEBO TEA Lapacho 
           
               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer and many other medical 
               problems even drug addiction 

                mg per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure 
               prostate trouble 

               This list is NOT exhaustive 


          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN
          DIAGNOSED cancers as well as PREVENT them and also prevent 
          and cure many other medical problems including heart
          diseases  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work 
          effectively 

          Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these 
          remedies especially The Day Fast and The Grape Diet send 
          a strong message to one's subconscious mind PROGRAMMING it 
          to CURE the cancer 

          In my opinion if a person finds out that she has cancer 
          then she should promptly try at least the first  remedies 
          described above in sequence starting with The Day Fast 
          BEFORE resorting to the UNnatural and expensive mutilations 
          and agonies POISON BURN and MUTILATE of orthodox cancer

There was a story a few weeks ago on a network news show about some sort
of fungus which supposedly attacks the bone structure and is somewhat
widespread in California  Anybody hear anything about this one


The only fungus I know of from California is Coccidiomycosis  I
hadn't heard that it attacked bone  It attacks lung and if you
are especially unlucky the central nervous system  Nothing new
about it  It's been around for years  THey call it valley
fever since it is found in the inland valleys not on the coast

There is a miniepidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in
I believe the Owen's Valley Bishop area east of the Sierras
I don't believe there has been any great insight into the
increased incidence in that area There is a lowlevel
of endemic infection in that region Many people with
evidence of past exposure to the organism did not have
serious disease

I am currently doing a group research project on the drug Xanax  I would
be exponentially gracious to receive any and all information you could
provide
me regarding its usage history mechanism of reaction side effects and
other pertinent information  I don't care how long or how short your 
response is

Thanks in advance

In article lindaeCJGLKFxMnetcomcom lindaenetcomcom writes


My biggest resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like most
people with dizziness can be cured  That's definitely not the
case  In most cases like I said above it is a long tedious
process that may or may not end up in a partial cure  


Be sure to say chronic dizziness not just dizziness  Most
patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better
The vertiginous spells of Meniere's will also eventually go
away however the patient is left with a deaf ear

All true  And all good points


To anyone suffering with vertigo dizziness or any variation
thereof my best advice to you as a fellowsufferer is this
just keep searchingdon't let the doctors tell you there's
nothing that can be donedo your own researchand let your

This may have helped you but I'm not sure it is good general
advice  The odds that you are going to find some miracle with
your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge
for this or any other disease are slim  When good answers to these

then spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical
problem may divert that energy from more productive things
in life  A limited amount should be spent to assure yourself
that your doctor gave you the correct story but after it becomes
clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine
has no good solution perhaps the best strategy is to join
the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to
make a career out of it

Well making a career out of it is a bit strong  I still believe
that doing your own research is very very necessary  I would
not have progressed as much as I have today unless I had spent
the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done
And  years ago it was clear that there was no medicine that 
would help me  So should I have stopped searching  Thank
goodness I didn't  Now I found that there is indeed medicine
that helps me  

I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic  That you
would go to one doctor get a diagnosis maybe get a second
opinion and then move on with your life
Just as an example having seen  of the top specialists in 
this field in the country I have received  different diagnoses
These are the top names the ones that people come to from all over
the country  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself  Going
to a support group and in fact HEADING that support group was 
helpful for a while but after a point I found it very
unproductive  It was much more productive to do library research
make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself

A recent movie Lorenzo's Oil offers a perfect example of what
I'm talking about  If you haven't seen it you should  It's not
a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying  Doctors are
only human and can only do so much  But there are those of us
out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing
piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed

I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things
that is still so unknown  If I had a broken arm or a weak heart
or failing kidneys I might not have the same opinion  That's because 
those things are much more tangible and have much more concise 
definitions and treatments  With dizziness you just have to
decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to
find your way out of it


I have chosen the latter

Using a PC's keyboard on your workstation  compatibility issues

    Mini outline
         Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
         X terminals
         NeXT
         Silicon Graphics
         IBM RS
	 Other stuff

     Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port

	If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard
	Sun HP DEC etc then you're going to have a hard time finding
	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard  If your workstation
	runs the X window system you're in luck  You can buy a cheap used
	PC hook your expensive keyboard up to it and run a serial cable
	to your workstation  Then run a program on the workstation to read
	the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events

	The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and AX

	ax is a sophisticated program capable of controlling the mouse and
	even moving among widgets on the screen  It requires a server
	extension XTEST DECXTRAP or XTestExtension  To find out if your
	server can do this run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings
	appear in the extensions list  If your server doesn't have this
	you may want to investigate compiling XR patchlevel  or later
	or bugging your vendor

	kt is a simpler program which should work with unextended X servers
	Another program called xsendevent also exists but I haven't seen it

	Both ax and kt are available via anonymous ftp from sodaberkeleyedu

     X terminals

	Also a number of X terminals NCD Tektronics to name a few use
	PCcompatible keyboards  If you have an X terminal you may be all
	set  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the
	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard  Also some X terminals add
	extra buttons  you may need to keep your original keyboard around
	for the onceinabluemoon that you have to hit the Setup key

     NeXT

	NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop
	Bus meaning any Mac keyboard will work  Then they announced they
	were cancelling their hardware production  If you want any kind of
	upgrade for an older NeXT do it now

     Silicon Graphics

	Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines Indigo and
	beyond will use standard PCcompatible keyboards and mice  I don't
	believe this also applies to the Power Series machines  It's not
	possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards except by
	upgrading the entire machine  Contact your SGI sales rep for more
	details

     IBM RS

	IBM RS keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards  
	Unfortunately you can't just plug one in  You need two things a  
	cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   
	smaller PS style DIN and a new device driver for AIX  Believe 
	it or not IBM wrote this device driver recently I used it and it 
	works  However they don't want me to redistribute it  I've been  
	told Judy Hume   is a potential contact  If you learn 
	anything new please send me email				    
    
     Other stuff

	Some vendors here notably Health Care Keyboard Co and AccuCorp
	support some odd keyboard types and may be responsive to your
	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer  If you can
	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works either
	from the vendor or with a storage oscilloscope you may be in
	luck  Contact the companies for more details


Apple Adjustable Keyboard

    Supports Mac only

    Apple has recently announced their new splitdesign keyboard  The
    keyboard has one section for each hand and the sections rotate
    backward on a hinge  The sections do not tilt upward  The keys are
    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion

    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard
    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions

    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests which are not
    directly attachable to the keyboard

    Supports PC only highly likely

    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex  It's
    another splitdesign  One thumbwheel controls the tilt of both
    the left and righthand sides of the main alphanumeric section
    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal key PC keyboard

    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards also so this product will
    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels

    Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products
    Most if not all of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles
    including PS's and other MicroChannel boxes  They sell you
    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number
    of popular word processors and spreadsheets

    Each user trains' the system to their voice and there are provisions
    to correct the system when it makes mistakes on the fly  Multiple
    people can use it but you have to load a different personality file
    for each person  You still get the use of your normal keyboard too
    On the DragonDictateK you need to pause th sec between
    words  Dragon claims typical input speeds of  words per minute
    I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 

    The DragonDictateK can recognize  words at a time
    The DragonWriter  can recognize you guessed it  words at a time

    The idea is that one keyboard works with everything  You purchase
    compatibility modules a new cord and possibly new keycaps and
    then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines

    It's a threepiece folding keyboard  The layout resembles the
    standard key keyboard except sliced into three sections  Each
    section is on a custom telescoping universal mount  Each section
    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each
    individual to type in a natural posture  You can rearrange the three
    sections too have the keypad in the middle if you want  Each
    section is otherwise normalshaped ie you put all three sections
    flat and you have what looks like a normal key keyboard

Changes in this version

     Added information on StressFree another typing management tool 
     for Windows


TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS these aim to help you manage your keyboard use
by warning you to take a break every so often  The better ones also include
advice on exercises posture and workstation setup  Some use sound hardware to
 
warn of a break others use beeps or screen messages

Often RSI appears only after many years of typing and the pain has
a delayed action in the short term too frequently you can be typing
all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening
These tools act as an early warning system by listening to their
warnings and taking breaks with exercises you don't have to wait for your 
body to give you a more serious and painful warning  that is getting RSI

    Description
	Aimed at preventing RSI this program warns you to take
	breaks after a configurable interval based on clock time or

	It gives you  exercises to do each time randomly selected from
	a set of   Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work

	Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on
	how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does

	useful when used with Windows

	Cost  quantity discounts site licenses

    Comments
	The keystrokecounting approach looks good it seems better
	to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to
	measure clock time or even typing time  The marketing stuff
	is very good and includes some summaries of research papers
	as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company 
	to pay up for RSI management tools

    Comments
	I have a copy of this and it works as advertised I would say
	it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management because it
	does not allow breaks at periods less than  minutes  Also it
	interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which
	is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day  Worked OK on
	Windows  though it did occasionally crash with a UAE  not sure
	why Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC and has
	one window without window controls  Very usable though and does not
	require any sound hardware

    Comments
	I have had a play with this and it works OK  Its user interface
	design is much better in  though still a bit unusual
	expensive tool around and it does the job  It is also the only
	tool with a redistributable demo so if you do get the demo post it
	on your local bulletin boards FTP servers and Bitnet servers
	Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics but it does 
	have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence
	which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises

    Tool Typewatch freeware version  October 
    Available from
	Email to richarddhoskynscouk
	Anonymous ftp sodaberkeleyedupubtypinginjurytypewatchshar
    Platforms UNIX tested on SCO SunOS Mach character and X Window mode
    Description
	This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you
	to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously
	typing  It does not provide exercises but it does check
	that you really do take a break and tells you when you
	can start typing again  

	Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing
	today each time it warns you which is useful so you
	know how much you really type  It also logs information
	to a file that you can analyse or simply print out  

	The warning message appears on your screen in character mode
	in a popup window for X Windows or as a Zephyr message
	for those with Athena stuff   Tim Freeman tsfcscmuedu 
	has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for 
	X Zephyr and Mach

	Not formally supported but email richarddhoskynscouk
	for SCO SunOS character mode or tsfcscmuedu for Mach
	X Window mode Zephyr if you have problems or want to give 
	feedback

    Tool Various calendar  batch queue programs
    Available from
	Various sources
    Platforms Various
    Description
	Any calendarreminder program that warns you of an upcoming
	appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool
	Or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit
	a program to run at a specific time to display a message to
	the screen

	Using Windows as an example create a Calendar file and
	include this filename in your WININI's 'load' line so
	you get it on every startup of Windows  Suppose you
	want to have breaks every  minutes starting from  am
	Press F Special Time to enter an appointment enter
	 hit Enter and type some text in saying what the break
	is for  Then press F to set an alarm on this entry and repeat 
	for the next appointment

	By using Windows Recorder you can record the keystrokes
	that set up breaks throughout a day in a REC file  Put this
	file on your 'run' line as above and you will then with
	a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments
	with RSI exercises

	The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs 
	An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job
	that runs at  am and warns you to take a break this will
	depend a lot on your operating system

	While these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing 
	yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI 
	management tool  If you are techie enough you might want to
	write a version of Typewatch see above for your operating
	system using batch jobs or whatever fits best

    Tool Digital watches with countdown timers
    Available from
	Various sources eg Casio BP
    Description
	Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable
	number of minutes they usually reset easily to that number either
	manually or automatically  

	While these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you
	are writing reading driving or doing anything away from
	a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI  The great
	advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you
	are doing
	
    Comments
	My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to
	my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which
	actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left
	arm improved  Getting a countdown timer watch has been
	very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day

	I have tried an old fashioned hourglass type egg timer but
	these are not much good because they do not give an audible
	warning of the end of the time period


KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS these enable you to change your keyboard mapping
so you can type onehandedly or with a different twohanded layout  
Onehanded typing tools may help but be VERY careful about how 
you use them  if you keep the same overall typing workload you
are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing
and may therefore make matters worse

    Tool hsh public domain
    Available from
	Anonymous ftp sodaberkeleyedupubtypinginjuryhshshar
    Platforms UNIX don't know which ones
    Description
	Allows onehanded typing and other general keyboard remappings
	Only works through tty's so you can use it with a terminal or
	an xterm but not most X programs

    Tool Dvorak keyboard tools various
    Available from
	Anonymous ftp sodaberkeleyedupubtypinginjuryxdvorakc
	Also built into Windows x 
    Description
	The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout
	that involves more balanced hand use   It may help prevent
	RSI a bit but you can also use it if you have RSI since 
	it will slow down your typing a lot

In article lsjgnINNlcsaltillocsutexasedu turpincsutexasedu Russell Turpin writes

I wrote
  Or to use a phrasing that I think is more accurate science 
 is the investigation of phenomena that avoids methods and reasoning 
 that are known to be erroneous from past foulups 

In article CIuHBnbunyipccuqozau bdpsychpsyuqozau writes
 I can agree with this if you are talking about the less fundamental
 aspects of scientific method 
    
  In fact I don't see the alternative as I don't think that the 
 fundamentals are capable of experimental investigation  In saying
 this I am agreeing with the work of people like Kuhn  
 Feyerabend  and Lakatos 
      
While methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of experimental
investigation as that to which it is applied it can be critically
appraised  Methodologies can be compared to each other sometimes by
the conflicting results they produce  This kind of critical appraisal
and comparison together with the inappropriateness of existing
methodologies for new fields of study is what drives the evolution of
methodologies and how we think about them  

As usual you are missing the whole point Russell because you are not
willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith which
is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest
purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes  

This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management
is accurate bookkeeping  

If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes it
would be a poor thing indeed  What was the methodology of Darwin  What
was the methodology of Einstein  What was for that matter the
methodology of Jenner and Pasteur  


In an earlier article Russell Turpin writes  

None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should
open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedoscience
Modern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditional
Chinese medicine receive little respect because for the most
part they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research
Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty  This does
not imply that all their treatments are ineffective  It does
imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are
incapable of discovering which treatments are effective and
which are not

First of all I think you are arguing against a straw man because I
don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudoscience
homeopathy chiropracty and traditional Chinese medicine should be
accepted as science  I in particular think the basic ideas of
homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky  

What some of us do believe however is that some of these things
including some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientific
attention  

If in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do not
use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is
effective and what is not then science today would not exist  For all
of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose
methodology by current standards was seriously flawed  

It is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to reexamine
those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies  It is
also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on 
those early methodologies needs to be reexamined in a more rigorous 
fashion by those qualified to do so credibly  

But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate doubleblind studies is
capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no
ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly
be worthy of serious investigation  this truly marks one's attitude as
doctrinaire cultist  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in
reason  


In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems 
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

 General info on injuries

First and foremost of importance if you experience pain at all then
you absolutely need to go see a doctor  As soon as you possibly can  The
difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery
and a long drawnout ordeal  GO SEE A DOCTOR  Now your gardenvariety
doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury  Generally
any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in
these kinds of problems  DON'T WAIT THOUGH  GO SEE A DOCTOR

The remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from
a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour Occupational
Safety and Health Service Occupational Overuse Syndrome Treatment and
Rehabilitation A Practitioner's Guide

First a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands
note you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors 

  RSI Repetitive Strain Injury  a general term for many kinds of injuries
  OOS Occupational Overuse Syndrome  synonym for RSI
  CTD Cumulative Trauma Disorder  another synonym for RSI
  WRULD WorkRelated Upper Limb Disorders  yet another synonym for RSI
  CTS Carpal Tunnel Syndrome see below
  Hyperextension  Marked bending at a joint
  Pronation Turning the palm down
  Wrist extension Bending the wrist up
  Supination Turning the palm up
  Wrist flexion Bending the wrist down
  Pinch grip The grip used for a pencil
  Ulnar deviation Bending the wrist towards the little finger
  Power grip The grip used for a hammer
  Radial Deviation Bending the wrist toward the thumb
  Abduction Moving away from the body
  Overspanning Opening the fingers out wide

Now then problems come in two main types Local conditions and diffuse
conditions  Local problems are what you'd expect specific muscles
tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt
Diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle
discomfort pain burning andor tingling with identifiable areas of
tenderness in muscles although they're not necessarily the problem

 Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur  Here's the theory

Normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which
pass among the muscle fibers  When you tense a muscle you restrict
the blood flow  By the time you're exerting  of your full power
you're completely restricting your blood flow

Without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out
then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates
nasty byproducts like lactic acid which cause pain

Once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the
load  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes
things worse with repetitive motion  More tension means less blood flow
and the cycle continues

Another byproduct of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from
your nerves  They need blood too

Anyway when you're typing too much you're never really giving a change
for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never
relax enough to let the blood through  Stress poor posture and poor
ergonomics only make things worse

 Specific injuries you may have heard of

note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic  Acute
injuries are severely painful and noticable  Chronic conditions have
less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real

Tenosynovitis  an inflamation of the tendon sheath  Chronic tenosynovitis
occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to
cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability
to lubricate the tendon  As a result the tendon sheath thickens gets
inflamed and you've got your problem

Tendonitis  an inflammation of a tendon  Repeated tensing of a tendon
can cause inflamation  Eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating
and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more
swelling and more pain  Subacute tendonitis is more common which entails
a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse
with repetitive activity

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome  the nerves that run through your wrist into your
fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them  Symptoms include
feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation
CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition

Adverse Mechanical Tension  also known as 'neural tension' this is where
the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly
compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere
AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS 
disorders  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy 
brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy

Others for just about every part of your body there's a fancy name for
a way to injure it  By now you should be getting an idea of how OOS
conditions occur and why  Just be careful many inexperienced doctors
misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome when in reality you
may have a completely different problem  Always get a second opinion
before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery

 Typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment

The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce
tension in the muscles and tendons  This requires learning how to relax
If you're under a load of stress this is doubly important  Tune out
the world and breath deep and regular  Relaxing should become a guiding
principle in your work every three minutes take a three second break
EVERY THREE MINUTES TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK  Really do it every
three minutes  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings
calm down and relax

If you can't sleep you really need to focus on this  Rest sleep and
relaxation are really a big deal

There are all kinds of other treatments of course  Drugs can reduce
inflamation and pain  Custommolded splints can forcefully prevent bad
posture  Surgery can fix some problems  Exercise can help strengthen
your muscles  Regular stretching can help prevent injury  Good posture
and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension  Ice or hotcold
contrast baths also reduce swelling  Only your doctor can say what's best
for you

 Posture  here are some basic guidelines  I so liked the way this was
written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from
Appendix   dwallach

 Let your shoulders relax
 Let your elbows swing free
 Keep your wrists straight
 Pull your chin in to look down  don't flop your head forward
 Keep the hollow in the base of your spine
 Try leaning back in the chair
 Don't slouch or slump forward
 Alter your posture from time to time
 Every  minutes get up and bend your spine backward

Set the seat height first  Your feet should be flat on the floor  There 
should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees
and your thighs should not slope too much

Now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable
to work at  If you are short this may be impossible  The beest remedy
is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a
footrest

Now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space
between the backrest and the seat pan  The backrest should support you in
the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this
area

If you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning
back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available

Now I diverge a little from the text

A good chair makes a big difference  If you don't like your chair go
find a better one  You really want adjustments for height back angle
back height and maybe even seat tilt  Most arm rests seem to get in
the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm
rests which you can also rotate out of the way  You should find a good
store and play with all these chairs  pick one that's right for you
In the San Francisco Bay Area I highly recommend Just Chairs  The
name says it all

 Keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements

There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right  For some
people wrist pads seem to work wonders  However with good posture you
shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything  you would prefer your
keyboard to be right there  If you drop your arms at your side and then
lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands
when your elbows are at about  degrees  Of course you want to avoid
pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs  Wrist pads
may or may not help at this  You should get somebody else to come and
look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax  It's
often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or
deviated hands

Some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly
designed  A number of replacements are available on the market today

above sections looking for places where I've obviously goofed

I would also like to point out that most of the arguments about science
in scimed scipsychology etc are not about cases where people are
rejecting scientific argumentevidenceproof  They are about cases where
no adequate scientific research has been done   In some cases there is
quite a bit of evidence but it isn't in a format to fit doctrinaire
conceptions of what science is  

Here it is again  This indicates confusion between proof and the process
of doing science  

You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make
I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the
process of science and the end result  

As an end result of science one wants to get results that are
objectively verifiable  But there is nothing objective about the
process of science  

If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit
to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information
But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science  This
is where you and I disagree with Turpin  In order to have science one
must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere
collection of empirically validated random hypotheses

Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science but
they are merely the culmination of scientific research  The most
important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING  
Without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing  No
hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data
Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or
looking out the window  At least not unless you've done a lot of really
good thinking beforehand  

The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre
scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology  
It depends on the quality of their THINKING  

It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that
they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical
studies  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields such as
certain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all 
but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses  

And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that
science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes  Simply avoiding
mistakes doesn't get you anywhere  


In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems 
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

     The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and

 Two different Tuesdays two weeks apart we used the same day of the
 week just for consistancies sake we ordered food from the local 
 Chinese take out  same exact food except ONE of the days we had them
 hold the MSG  I did not know which time the food was ordered without
 the MSG but one time I had the reaction and one time I did not  
 
 NOW  you can TRY to tell me that it wasn't scientific enough and
 that I have not PROVEN beyond the shadow of a doubt that I have a
 reaction to MSG  but it was proof enough for ME and I'll have you
 know that I do NOT wish to get sick from eating food thank you very
 much  
 
If you could not tell which one had MSG why restaurants bother to
use it at all 

If you can taste the difference psychological reaction might play a role

The fact is MSG is part of natural substance Everyone I mean EVERYONE
consumes certain amount of MSG every day through regular diet without
the synthesized MSG additive

Chinese and many other Asians Japanese Koreans etc have used
MSG as flavor enhancer for two thousand years Do you believe that
they knew how to make MSG from chemical processes Not They just
extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth

Baring MSG is just like baring sugar which many people react to

A recent movie Lorenzo's Oil offers a perfect example of what

I saw it  It is almost a unique case in history  First ALD
is a rare but fatal disease  
Their accomplishment was significant  Of course it was overplayed
in the movie for dramatic effect  The oil is not curative and doesn't even
prevent progression only slows it 

There's a pretty good article in the the March   New Scientist titled
Pouring cold water on Lorenzo's oil  The article states that research
has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the
disease in patients in which demyelination has begun  In patients with
AMN a less acute form of the same disease there is some improvement
seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses  In ALD patients
who have not yet begun demyelination the jury is still out

Hello

I am planning on attending Podiatry School next year

I have narrowed my choices to the Pennsylvania College of Podiatric
Medicine in Philadelphia or the California College of Podiatric
Medicine in San Francisco  

If anyone has any information or oppinions about these two schools please
tell me  I am having a hard time deciding which one to attend and must
make a decision very soon  

thank you Larry

I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in
network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going
to describe here  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced
a seizure on November   at AM after eating Kellog's Frosted
Flakes  She is perfectly healthy had never experienced anything like
this before and there is no history of seizures in either side of the
family  All the tests EEG MRI EKG came out negative so the decision
was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again

Well we were going along fine and the other morning April  she had
a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal Fruit Loops I am
embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once
in a while So I pour it in her bowl and think Oh oh this is the
same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure  Ten 
minutes later she had a full blown seizures This was her first exposure
to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure

When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for
the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea  Now
after this second episode so similar in nature to the first even
he is scratching his head  Once again her EEG looks normal which I
understand can happen even when a person has a seizure

Once again we are waiting I have been thinking that it would be good
to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any
experience with this kind of thing  I know that members of the medical
community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and
foods play in our general health and wellbeing  Anyway as you can
guess I am worried sick about this and would appreciate any ideas
anyone out there has  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get
across what is going on here

Thanks

Chinese and many other Asians Japanese Koreans etc have used
MSG as flavor enhancer for two thousand years Do you believe that
they knew how to make MSG from chemical processes Not They just
extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth

And to add further fuel to the flame war I read about  years ago that
the natural MSG  extracted from the sources you mention above  does not
cause the reported aftereffects it's only that nasty artificial MSG 
extracted from coal tar or whatever  that causes Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome  I find this pretty hard to believe has anyone else heard it

What about Kekule's infamous derivation of the idea of benzene rings
from a daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails  Is this
specific enough to count  Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic
phil of sci texts as an example of the inventive component of
hypothesizing 

And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root
Bernstein  See his book Discovering  Ring structures for benzene
had been proposed before Kekule' after him and at the same time as him
The current models do not resemble Kekule's  Many of the predecessors
of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more

I don't think extrascientific is a very useful phrase in a discussion
of the boundaries of science except as a proposed definiens  Extrarational
is a better phrase  In fact there are quite a number of wellknown cases
of extrarational considerations driving science in a useful direction

For example Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of
enantiomers the origin of stereochemistry partly because he liked a
friend's crank theory of chemical action  The friend was wrong but
Pasteur's discovery stood  A prior investigator Mitscherlich looking
at the same phenomenon had missed a crucial detail presumably because he
lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic
acid from tartaric now we say dtartaric acid

Again Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers
tartaric acid again not because of some rational conviction but because
he was trying to produce yeast that lived on ltartaric acid  His notebooks
contained fantasies of becoming the Newton of mirrorimage life which
he never admitted publically

Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes  Avery
started this work because of one of his students and ardent Anglophile
and Francophobe Canadian defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice
Most of Griffiths' critics were French which decided the issue for the
student  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro which the
student eventually did whereupon Avery was convinced and started the
research program which in  or so years produced the famous discovery

 see the ulterior motive here  It is easy for me to see it the
 those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything
 There is a lot of money involved

	You keep bringing this up But I don't understand what's in it
financially for the physician to go ahead and treat Unless the physician
has an investment in or is involved in some kickback scheme with the
home infusion company where is the financial gain for the doctor

Well let me put it this way based on my own experience  A
general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases
by establishing links to the Lyme community treating patients
who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they
have lyme as if they did saying that diseases such as MS
are probably spirochetal if not Lyme giving talks at meetings
of users groups validating the feelings of even delusional
patients etc  This GP can go from being a runofthemill
Kyr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital
and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his
office and making lots of bread  Also getting the adulation
of many who believe his is their only hope if not of cure
then of control and seeing his name in publications put out
by support groups etc  This is a definite temptation

Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council

 New Data Show About  Major US Water Supplies Vulnerable To
MilwaukeeType Disease Outbreak
 To National Desk Environment Writer
 Contact Erik Olson or Sarah Silver  both
          of the Natural Resources Defense Council

   WASHINGTON April    Internal EPA data released
today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about
 large water systems  serving cities from Boston to San
Francisco  do not filter to remove diseasecarrying organisms
leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease
outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee
   The EPA list is attached
   These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water
supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate
pollution controls or filtration said Erik Olson a senior
attorney with NRDC  Water contamination isn't just a problem in
Bangladesh it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston
   As of June   about  large surface water systems on
EPA's list probably will be breaking the law  The  Safe
Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either
filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use
from pollution Olson continued  Some systems are moving
towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are
expected to miss the law's deadline
   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already
a reality in other cities  A  survey of  US surface
water systems by water utility scientists found that  percent
of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism
cryptosporidium and  percent contained a similar parasite
called giardia
   Adding to the level of concern a General Accounting Office
study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee
Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the
nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary
surveys of water systems
   This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions
of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be
assured that their water is safe to drink  We must immediately
put into place programs to protect water sources from
contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment
must be installed to protect the public Olson noted  The time
has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop
dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from
contamination consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs
needed to assure their water is safe to drink
   NRDC is a national nonprofit environmental advocacy organization

We were talking about Migraine and Exercise I'm the one who can't
fathom the thought of exercise during migraine  Anyway turning
the thread around the other day I played tennis during my lunch
hour  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise  I
got overheated and dehydrated  Afterwards I noticed a tingling
sensation all over my head then about  hours later I could feel
a migraine start  I continued to drink water in the afternoon
I took cafergot but it didn't help and the pain started although
it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about pm that night the
pain subsided

This isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exercise
I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder
what triggers the migraine in this situation heat buildup dehydration
I'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do besides get into 
shape and don't play at high noon to prevent this

Thanks

a lot to keep from going back to morbid obesity  I think all
of us cycle  One's success depends on how large the fluctuations
in the cycle are  Some people can cycle only  pounds  Unfortunately
I'm not one of them


This certainly describes my situation perfectly For me there is
a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat which appears to
be totally limitless and the purely conscious desire to not
put on too much weight When I get too fat I just dietexercise
more with varying degrees of success to take off the
extra weight Usually I cycle within a  lb range but
smaller and larger cycles occur as well I'm always afraid
that this method will stop working someday but usually
I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check
This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion
of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting
that results in longterm weight gain I have been cycle
dieting for at least  years without seeing such a change

I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward
keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low

Have there been any important and documented investigations into
homeopathic principles

I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend I turned to the
section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine and two
paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide
any sort of explanation The author stated this with pride as though
it were some sort of virtue Why am I sceptical about homeopathy Is
it because I am a narrowminded bigot or is it because homeopathy
really looks more like witchdoctory than anything else

 Gary By extrascientific I did not mean to imply that hypothesis

I am further puzzled by the proposed distinction between scientific
logic and inductive logic  At this point I don't have a clue
what you mean by extrascientific  unless you mean that at some
times someone seems to come up with an idea that we can't trace to
prior theories concepts knowledge etc  This is a fairly common
observation but just for grins I'd like to see some genuine examples

OK just for grins
 Kekule hypothesized a resonant structure for the aromatic benzene
ring after waking from a dream in which a snake was swallowing his tail
 Archimedes formalized the principle of buoyancy while meditating in
his bath

In neither case was there no connection to prior theories concepts etc
as you stipulated above What there was was an intuitive leap beyond
the current way of thinking to develop ideas which subsequently proved
to have predictive power eg they stood the test of experimental
verification

Yes but typically they don't  Not every wild flight of fancy serves
or can serve in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis  It is
somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an
example of this sort the only one they come up with is the one about
Kekule  Surely there must be others  But apparently this is regarded
as an extreme example of a nonrational process in science whereby
a successful hypothesis was proposed  But how nonrational is it

Of course we can't hope currently at least to explain how or why
Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails

 The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre
 scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology  
 It depends on the quality of their THINKING  

 It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that
 they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical
 studies 

 And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that
 science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes  Simply avoiding
 mistakes doesn't get you anywhere  

I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes
Above Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great
science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre
science that makes smaller steps  In most of this thread I have
been concerned with the difference between what is science and
what is not 

Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between
Einstein and the average postdoc physicist is the quality of
their thought  But what is the difference between Einstein and a
genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts
are scientifically screwy  Some would give Velikovsky or
Korzybski as examples  If you don't like these choose your
own  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre
physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi  Both Einstein and
the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the
cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong
Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to
do this  

Let me approach this from a second direction  When one is asked
to review a paper for a journal or conference there are many
kinds of criticism that one can make  One kind of criticism is
that the work is just wrong or misinformed  Another kind of
criticism is that the work while technically correct is either
not important or not interesting  The first difference is the
one that I have been pointing to  The second difference is the
one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing 

 If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit
 to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information
 But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science  This
 is where you and I disagree with Turpin  

I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered 
scientific what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims
not just of some of its proposed remedies  Similarly I suspect
that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work
what it lacks as one example is any experiment that tests the
presence of qi

  In order to have science one must have a theoretical
 structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically
 validated random hypotheses

Certainly a theoretical structure that makes sense is the goal
In areas where we do not yet have this I see nothing wrong with
forming and testing smaller hypotheses  Let's face it we cannot
always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything
clear for us  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to
plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can

 Is there such a thing as MSG monosodium glutamate sensitivity
 I saw in the NY Times Sunday that scientists have testified before 
 an FDA advisory panel that complaints about MSG sensitivity are
 superstition Anybody here have experience to the contrary 
 
 I'm old enough to remember that the issue has come up at least
 a couple of times since the s Then it was called the
 Chinese restaurant syndrome because Chinese cuisine has
 always used it

 So far I've seen about a dozen posts of anecdotal evidence but
 no facts  I suspect there is a strong psychological effect at 
 work here  Does anyone have results from a scientific study
 using doubleblind trials  

Here is another anecdotal story  I am a picky eater and never wanted to 
try chinese food however I finally tried some in order to please a
girl I was seeing at the time  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant
syndrome  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared  different
dishes  It didn't taste great but I decided it wasn't so bad  We went
home and went to bed early  I woke up at  AM and puked my guts outs
I threw up for so long that I'm not kidding I pulled a muscle in
my tongue  Dry heaves and everything  No one else got sick and I'm
not allergic to anything that I know of  

Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am 
physically threatened  The smell of the food makes me ill and that is
a psycholgical reaction  When I have been dragged in to suffer
through beef and broccoli without any sauces I insist on no MSG  
I haven't gotten sick yet

I hope this is the correct newsgroup for this

What is the scoop on Methanol and its future as an alternative fuel for
vehicles   How does it compare to ethanol 

There was some news about health risks involved  Anybody know about
that  How does the US Clean Air act impact the use of Methanol by the
year  

I think its Methyl Tertiary butyl ether which the future industries will
use as a substitute for conventional fuels

There is company Methanex which produces  of the world's supply of
Methanol Does anybody know about it 

Please reply by email as I do not read these newsgroups

The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so
greatly Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face Some
claim their heart skipped beats once in a while Some reacted with
headache some stomach ache Some had watery eyes or running nose some
had itchy skin or rashes More serious accusations include respiration 
difficulty and brain damage 

Now here is a new one vomiting My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
suspect of any problem In this case it might be just food poisoning But
if you heard things about MSG you may think it must be it

I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different
conclusion I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems I went
with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest and they ordered
lots of stuff I had never seen before The only thing I can remember of that
meal was the first course scallops served in the shell with a soytype sauce
I thought Well I've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that
could have been a coincidence That night as I sat on the bathroom floor
sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way I decided I would never touch
another scallop I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance

 of extrarational considerations driving science in a useful direction

Yeah but the problem with holding up the extrarational examples as
exemplars or as refutations of well founded methodology is that you
run smack up against such unuseful directions as Lysenko  Such extra
rational cases are curiosities  not guides to methodology

As has been noted before there is the distinction between motivation
and method  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is
described in sufficient detail to be replicated and the replications
do indeed reproduce the result  No theoretical argument should be
accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed and
reasonable knowlegeable people agree with the force of the logic

But people try experiments and pursue arguments for all sorts of crazy
reasons  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities they are a
large part of the history of science

There are a couple of negative points to make here

 A theory of qi could conceivably become accepted without direct
verification of the existence of qi  For example quarks are an accepted
part of the standard model of physics with no direct verification  What
would be needed would be a theory based on qi that predicted medical
reality better than the alternatives  The central theoretical claim could
lie forever beyond experiment as long as there was a sufficient body of
experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other

I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi though
I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it much less
a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology  And it
is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather
directly verifying the existence of qi

 Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational
experimentdatatheory sequence  Most experiments are carried out and
interpreted in preexisting theoretical frameworks  The theoretical
controversies of the day determine which experiments get done  Overall
there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies crazy motivations
petty hatreds and the like that determines which experiments and which
computations get done  What keeps it going forward is the critical
function of science results don't count unless they can be replicated

The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generateandtest  The generate
part can be totally irrational as long as the test part works properly

Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals
but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed
that when you separate them by handedness you get two chemicals that rotate
polarized light in opposite directions and the rightrotating version was
indistinguishable from tartaric acid  Pasteur's irrational motivation had
led to a replicable and important result

This is where Lysenko creationists etc fail  They have usually not
even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything  When their
theories do predict and are contradicted by experiment they do not
concede the point and modify their theories rather they try to suppress
the results Lysenko or try to divert attention to other evidence they
think supports their position creationists

Gary Merrill writes
  Not every wild flight of fancy serves
 or can serve in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis  It is
 somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an
 example of this sort the only one they come up with is the one about
 Kekule  Surely there must be others  But apparently this is regarded
 as an extreme example of a nonrational process in science whereby
 a successful hypothesis was proposed  But how nonrational is it

Indeed an extreme example  It came out of nowhere  The connection
Kekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary
I for example often receiveconjure solutions hypotheses for solutions 
to my everyday problems at moments when I appear to myself to be occupied 
with activities quite removed  Algorithms for that new software feature come
when I trample the meadow on my occasional runs  Alternative better ways 
to instruct and rear my sons arrive while I weed the garden  I'll swear I am 
not thinking about any of it when ideas come   

These ideas are not the stuff of great discoveries of course but my
connecting them to particular problems is fraught with deliberation and
occasional fits of rationality

 Surely it wasn't the only daydream Kekule had  What was special about
 this one  Could it have had something to do with a perceived
 analogy between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning
 geometry of molecules  

Yes  And he was lucky to have such a colorful vivid image  I alas will
never figure out why returning worms to the loose soil of my garden brought 
have him count objects instead of merely count to mind regarding my  
yearold's fledging arithmetic skills

  Upon close examination
 is there a nonrational mystical leap taking place or is it perhaps
 closer to a formal though often incomplete analogy or model

The latter  Worms wiggling around in the dirt fascinate my son

Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable  However it is also 
widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity 
And in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is 
indicative of a psychological disorder  In the extreme case a  
perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might 
make that he is unable to even leave the house  

In science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible 
and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these 
discoveries  Usually there is some tradeoff between these two desiderata 
 the search for scope and the search for certainty  

If th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and 
Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither 
of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since 
they lacked the concept of a limit  And in fact because of the lack of 
a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus 
It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid 
grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz  Nonetheless what Newton 
and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great 
deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost 
through the mistakes they made  

In article Aprkestreledu kingreasoningcom 
    Dick King writes
   Somebody writes 
I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology  
  
He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a
universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not
         
Einstein played by the rules which demand that hypotheses only be put out
there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them

These are not the rules according to many who post to scimed and
scipsychology  According to these posters  If it's not supported by
carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science

Taken to the extreme I believe that the attitude that empirical studies 
are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification 
of science  

For one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology 
results in a sort of scientific tradeunionism where those outside 
the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have 
no chance to obtain a hearing  I don't in the least believe that this 
is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology  Nonetheless 
it is one of the results   And although institutional science has 
certainly produced many wonderful results I think it is a foolish 
arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment 
 and using less than perfect empirical methodology  will ever come 
with anything worthwhile  

Furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is
one of the most significant errors in science  choosing to investigate
questions because they can be readily handled by the currently
fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional
or corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention to
those questions which seem to have fundamental significance

For instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated with
statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative
One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many
areas of psychology  In my opinion a perusal of many of the papers
resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions
into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's
assertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors

I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental 
error in science  Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the 
others  And I think that scientific journals are full of all 
too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are 
worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place  


In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems 
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

                the other day I played tennis during my lunch
hour  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise  I
got overheated and dehydrated  Afterwards I noticed a tingling
sensation all over my head then about  hours later I could feel
a migraine start  I continued to drink water in the afternoon
I took cafergot but it didn't help and the pain started although
it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about pm that night the
pain subsided

This isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exercise
I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder
what triggers the migraine in this situation heat buildup dehydration
I'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do besides get into 
shape and don't play at high noon to prevent this

Hi Janet

Sounds exactly like mine  Same circumstance same onset symptoms 
same cafergot uselessness same duration  In fact of all the people
I know who have migraines none have been so similar  There is such
a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their
headaches that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned
about mine but since ours seem to be alike here are my observations

I don't think it's heat per se I've had more in winter than summer
Dehydration could conceivably figure though  Try tanking up before
playing rather than after

Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much either

I've identified four factors that do make a difference listed in 
descending order of importance

 Heavy exercise
 Sleep deprivation
 Fasting		eg skipped breakfast
 Physical trauma	eg head bonk

Heavy exercise has preceded all of my postadolescent migraines but I 
don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session  One or more of 
the other factors must be present usually   Since I discovered 
this I've been nearly migrainefree  relapsing only once every two 
or three years when I get cocky It's been so long maybe I just don't 
get them anymore and stop being careful

Hope this is helpful

John

A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis as a result of
trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago  The psoriasis is under
control but the arthritis part of the illness is not

Ansaid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory worked pretty well for three years but
isn't helping much now  My friend is now taking Meclomen another NSAID but
this isn't helping control the pain at all  In the past two months my friend
has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines but the
effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months

As a result of the pain my friend is having problems sleeping  Staying in
one position too long is an ordeal  Another major contributor to pain is that
tendonitis has now developed left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of
the palm bottom of feet shoulders and outer thighs  The tendonitis is
quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment
to relieve it

The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the antiinflammatories and is
now recommending Prednisone  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some
of the pain from the tendonitis

My friend is a  year old male who feels like he's  his words not mine


If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis alternative
courses of action support groups or literature on it I would be extremely
grateful if you could email to me  If anyone is interested I'll post a
summary to this newsgroup

thanks in advance

 The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so

 headache some stomach ache Some had watery eyes or running nose some
 had itchy skin or rashes More serious accusations include respiration 
 difficulty and brain damage 
 
 Now here is a new one vomiting My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
 suspect of any problem In this case it might be just food poisoning But
 if you heard things about MSG you may think it must be it

Surprise surprise different people react differently to different things One
slightly off the subject case in point My brother got stung by a bee I know
he is allergic to bee stings but that his reaction is severe localized
swelling not anaphylactic shock I could not convince the doctors of that
however because that's not written in their little rule book

I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad

   I have a BACK MACHINE and have had one since January  While I have not 
found it to be a panacea for my back pain I think it has helped somewhat 
It MAINLY acts to stretch muscles in the back and prevent spasms associated
with pain  I am taking less pain medication than I was previously  
   The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant to honor their return 
policy  They extended my warranty period rather than allow me to return 
the machine when after the first month or so I was not thrilled with it 
They encouraged me to continue to use it abeit less vigourously 
   Like I said I can't say it is a cureall but it keeps me stretched out
and I am in less pain

a lot to keep from going back to morbid obesity  I think all
of us cycle  One's success depends on how large the fluctuations
in the cycle are  Some people can cycle only  pounds  Unfortunately
I'm not one of them


This certainly describes my situation perfectly For me there is
a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat which appears to
be totally limitless and the purely conscious desire to not
put on too much weight When I get too fat I just dietexercise
more with varying degrees of success to take off the
extra weight Usually I cycle within a  lb range but
smaller and larger cycles occur as well I'm always afraid
that this method will stop working someday but usually
I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check
This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion
of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting
that results in longterm weight gain I have been cycle
dieting for at least  years without seeing such a change

As mentioned in Adiposity  only some experience weight
rebound  The fact that you don't doesn't prove it doesn't
happen to others

asking me what it's like  I'm not sure what his symptoms would be  

The answer is yes and no  I'm sure others on scimed can expand on this

Jon

I know from personal experience that men CAN get yeast infections I 
get rather nasty ones from time to time mostly in the area of the
scrotum and the base of the penis They're nowhere near as dangerous
for me as for many women but goddamn does it hurt in the summertime
Even in the wintertime when I sweat I get really uncomfy down there The
best thing I can do to keep it under control is keep my weight down and
keep cool down there Shorts in  degree weather that kind of thing And
of course some occasional sun

My mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease  a big
relief as it was a lump that could have been cancer  Her doctor says
she should go off caffeine and chocolate for  months as well as
stopping the estrogen she's been taking for menopauserelated reasons
She's not thrilled with this I think especially because she just gave
up cigarettes  soon she won't have any pleasures left  Now I thought
I'd heard that cystic breasts were common and not really a health risk
Is this accurate  If so why is she being told to make various
sacrifices to treat something that's not that big of a deal

Thanks for any information

immunoglobin to thier young through thier milk  In fact a calf must
have a sufficient amount of colostrum early milk within  hours to

 hours the intestines are open to the IG passage  My question is
does this apply to human infants to any degree

I love the FAQ       

The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining
correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting  Why is
this  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well

Also why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of
only about  of the corneal depth while RK is done to a depth of up to
  Why such a difference  I thought the proceedures were simmilar
with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK  I must not
be understanding all of the differences

In the FAQ the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than
with glasses alone  If this is completly attributable to the
intentional slight undercorrection then it can be compensated for when
necessary with glasses or contacts if they CAN be worn afterall  It
is important to know if that is not the case however and some other
consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision  The
first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense which
glasses couldn't help 

would not help

Hello to everybody
I write here because I am kind of desperate For about six weeks I've been
suffering on pains in my left head side the left leg and sometimes the left 
arm I made many tests eg computer tomography negative lyme borreliosis
negative all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range they're
all oK so I should be healthy As a matter of fact I am not feeling so
I was also at a Neurologist's too he considered me healthy too

The blood tests have shown that I have little too much of Hemoglobin 
common range is  to  I unfortunately do not know about the units
Could these hemisided pains be the result of this or of a also possible
block of the neck muscles 

I have no fever and I am not feeling entirely sick but neither entirely 
healthy 

Please answer by direct email on ghilardiurzunibasch

Thanks for every hint

Hi there
I'm suffering from Sarcoidosis at present  Although it's shown as a
chronic  rare tissue disorder it is thankfully NOT life threatening

The very worsed thing that can happen to a nontreated sufferer is
glaucoma  My specialists are bombarding me with Prednisolone EC a
corticosteriod and after four months at mg a day it's totally done
away with my enlarged lymph glands so somethings happening for the
good

 This is something of a long shot but what the hell  the net is
 full of people with strange knowledge

 I'm looking for suggestions as to what could be causing health
 problems one of my relatives is having

 One of my cousins has had health problems for much of her life
 Around the age of  she had some gynecological problems  Now she's
 in her earlymid twenties and she is going blind

 Her eyes are not producing enough if any moisture  She's been going
 to Mass Eye and Ear and the doctors there have no clue what the actual
 cause is  THey have apparently tried eyedrops and such  She is just
 about completely blind in one eye and the other is massively
 deteriorated


Sjogren's syndrome has been known to induce dryness in vaginal tissue as well
as induce primary biliary cirrhosis Otherwise the abdominal swelling could be
due to a complication of Sjogren's known as pseudolymphoma which can produce
a splenomegaly enlarged spleen She should definitely see a rheumatologist

Since you don't mention skin disorder anemia or joint pain you'd probably
rule out erythema nodosum or scleroderma

 Also and this may or may not be related she is having some changes
 in her abdomen  her stomach has swelled i'm not sure if this is
 stomach the organ or stomach teh area of the body

 I guess the step they're going to take next is to do a whole battery
 of tests to check all the other internal systmes besides just the
 eyes

 but just because the net is a source of large amounts of bizarre
 knowledge i'm going to ask has anyone ever heard of anything like
 this  suggestions of things to ask about since much of my knowledge
 about her state comes second or third hand

  Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational
 experimentdatatheory sequence  Most experiments are carried out and
 interpreted in preexisting theoretical frameworks  The theoretical
 controversies of the day determine which experiments get done  Overall
 there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies crazy motivations
 petty hatreds and the like that determines which experiments and which
 computations get done  What keeps it going forward is the critical
 function of science results don't count unless they can be replicated
 
 The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generateandtest  The generate
 part can be totally irrational as long as the test part works properly

I think we agree on much  However the paragraphs above seem to repeat
uncritically the standard KuhnLakatosFeyerabend view of progress and
rationality in science  Since I've addressed these issues in this
newsgroup in the not too distant past I won't go into them again now

What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the

even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around

resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply
do not generalize well to the actual history of science

a protruding and extruded disc at LL  I went to a neurosurgeon
who prescribed prednisole a steroidal antiinflamitory and bed

whether or not this rest is helpful or if surgery is the next

You don't say whether or not you have any symptoms other than pain
If you have numbness weakness or bladder problems for example
these would suggest a need for surgery If pain is your only symptom
you might do well to find a reputable multidisciplinary pain
clinic in your area Chronic low back pain generally doesn't do well
with surgery acute on chronic pain as only symptom doesn't fare
much better

Well folks I currently have a yeast infection I am male
 your best bet or at least your husband's
is to treat and cure your infection before any intercourse If you must use
a condom Also consider other forms of sexual release ie handjobs until
you are cured 

Though I can't imagine WANTING to have intercourse during a fullblown
yeast infection  chances of it being transmitted to the male are quite
low especially if he's circumcised  But it can happen 
At one point I was getting recurrent yeast infections and the Dr suspected
my boyfriend might have gotten it from me and be reinfecting me  The
prescription was interesting  For each day of the medication a week I 
was to insert the medication then to have intercourse  The resulting 
action would help the medicine be spread around in me better and would 
simultaneously treat him

UNIVERSITY STUDENTS



  


   New Program Announcement   



            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program JSTMP is a new
program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon 
University  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific 
communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June  and 
January 


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the 
United States  It is also designed to let scientists engineers and managers
experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development  This is 
facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and
laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop
longterm professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts


PROGRAM DESIGN
To fulfill the objectives of the program participants will be required to 
develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and
its culture  Correspondingly JSTMP consists of three major components

 TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE
Several Japanese language courses will be offered including intensive courses
designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a
relatively short time

 EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE
A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the
cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in 
manufacturing and information technology  Courses will be available in a 
variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology
Sociology History and Political Science  Moreover seminars and colloquiums
will be conducted  Further a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or 
research facilities in the United States will be scheduled


 AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN
Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU 
participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe
and participate in the management of technology  Internships in Japan
will generally run for one year however shorter ones are possible


FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES AS WELL AS
STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE

Is there such a thing as MSG monosodium glutamate sensitivity
I saw in the NY Times Sunday that scientists have testified before 
an FDA advisory panel that complaints about MSG sensitivity are
superstition Anybody here have experience to the contrary 

I'm old enough to remember that the issue has come up at least
a couple of times since the s Then it was called the
Chinese restaurant syndrome because Chinese cuisine has
always used it

So far I've seen about a dozen posts of anecdotal evidence but
no facts  I suspect there is a strong psychological effect at 
work here  Does anyone have results from a scientific study
using doubleblind trials  

Check out  just some  posts before your own Maybe you missed
it amidst the flurry of responses Yet again the use of this
newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters
they have substantial knowledge of

For cites on MSG look up almost anything by John W Olney a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive and that its major constituent glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
humans included  Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown
off  Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food  By eating lots of junk food
packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous real physilogical effects 
Read Olney's review paper in Prog Brain Res  and check his
sources They are impecable There is no dispute

even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around
having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and
petty hatreds

Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common  The crucial
thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren't of any use
unless they make you do some experiments  I've known a lot of scientists
whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won't admit
out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers

Simple example Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA
electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments  He got very excited hoping that
he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
genes  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
binding assays  The result was a wellconserved  or so bp sequence
that occurs about  times in the human genome  Unfortunately for
Warren's fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in
so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into
the genome  On the other hand the characteristics of transposons were
much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was
recognized and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created
Other species have different sets of transposons  Fortunately for me
Warren and I used to eat dinner at TGI Fridays all the time

It further at least implicitly advances the position that
sciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given the
context in which it occurs by generating in a completely nonrational
and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then
weeded out via the critical function of science

I'm not sure that it's random  But there is no known rational mechanism
for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses  If you are really
working in an unknown area it is unlikely that you will have much sense
of what might or might not be true under those circumstances the best
thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have  If they are wrong
you will find out soon enough but at least you will find out something
If you try to do experiments at random with no prior conceptions at all
in mind you will probably get nowhere

Though why this critical
function should be less subject to the nonrational forces is a mystery

Unfortunately the critical function does sometimes become hostage to
nonrational forces  Then we get varieties of pathological science
Lysenko Mirsky's opposition to DNAasgene cold fusion and so forth

If experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction are
subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally true
of the application of any critical function concerning replication
This is what leads one ala Feyerabend to an anything goes view

I don't agree that this follows  In fact this is exactly the point at
which I disagree with Feyerabend  It is a most important part of the
culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing
process  Failures there are aplenty but on the whole things work out

Another point there are a couple of senses of the phrase experimental
design''  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental choice
not design  Alexander Fleming Proc Royal Soc  chose to look for
bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons Phage had previously
been found in locust diarrhea Fleming probably thought runny bottom runny
nose what the hell it's worth a try but his method of looking for phage
was welldesigned to detect anything phagelike in fact he found lysozyme

True the generation part can be totally irrational  But typically it is
not  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have
resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply
do not generalize well to the actual history of science

It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational  Perhaps
you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out
for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first
advanced from logical grounds  The main examples I can think of are from
modern highenergy physics which is not typical of science as a whole

I love the FAQ       

The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining
correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting  Why is
this  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well

I've had PRK

I would suggest asking a doctor about contacts Mine said yes to
contacts I think the scars from RK would preclude contacts

Also why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of
only about  of the corneal depth while RK is done to a depth of up to
  Why such a difference  I thought the proceedures were simmilar
with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK  I must not
be understanding all of the differences

No RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea up to
 I think and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress
chages PRK vaporizes burns away a thin layer from the front of the
cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter The laser doesn't
cut in PRK it vaporizes In RK the eye is cut into

In the FAQ the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than
with glasses alone  If this is completly attributable to the
intentional slight undercorrection then it can be compensated for when
necessary with glasses or contacts if they CAN be worn afterall  It
is important to know if that is not the case however and some other
consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision  The
first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense which
glasses couldn't help 

would not help

I find my vision is more clear for some things and less clear for
others only at night I notice a definite haloing at night in the
darkness when I look at automobile headlamps though this is not
something I spend inordinate amounts of time doing For ordinary
things my vision in particular having a fullyoperating peripheral
vision is clearer than with glasses or contacts

Surely it wasn't the only daydream he had  What was special about
this one  Could it have had something to do with a perceived
analogy between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning
geometry of molecules  Is such analogical reasoning extrascientific
Or is it rather at the very heart of science Perice's notion of abduction
the use of models within and across disciplines  Upon close examination
is there a nonrational mystical leap taking place or is it perhaps
closer to a formal though often incomplete analogy or model

Surprise surprise different people react differently to different things One
slightly off the subject case in point My brother got stung by a bee I know
he is allergic to bee stings but that his reaction is severe localized
swelling not anaphylactic shock I could not convince the doctors of that
however because that's not written in their little rule book
Of course bee venom isn't a single chemical  Could be your brother is
reacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shock
in other people

Hmmm  The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction
the first poster's brother did  We went off to the doctor to see if I
should worry about the fact that my foot was now about  times it's normal
size  And itched  Ow  He basically said I shouldn't this time but
that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to
but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that
next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock  Admittedly this
was many years ago when I was young  Since then I just make sure I don't
get stung  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me but I don't  

This isn't scientific or proof but this would lead me to believe it's not a
different reaction just a different degree of reaction  Allergies work
that way  People have various reactions  Sort of like diabetes some
people can get by with just monitoring their diet others have to monitor
their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet
like a hawk and use insulin regularly  

I think MSG is probably similarsome people have allergic reactions to
it  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy
saucebut the chinese have been using it for centuries that doesn't
necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone

Similarly Chinese food isn't just MSG  There are a lot of other
ingredients in it  Why when someone eats something with lots of
ingredients they don't normally consume one of which happens to be
MSG do they immediately conclude that any negative reaction is to
the MSG 

ARGHHHHHHHHHh

READ THE MEMOS

I said that I PERSONALLY had other people order the EXACT SAME FOOD at
TWO DIFFERENT TIMES from the SAME RESTAURANT and the people that
ordered the food for me did NOT TELL ME which time the MSG was in the
food and which time it was not in the food

ONE TIME I HAD A REACTION

ONE TIME I DID NOT

THE REACTION CAME THE TIME THE MSG WAS IN THE FOOD

THAT WAS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

SAME RESTAURANT  SAME INGREDIENTS

Why when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don't
normally consume one of which happens to be MSG do they immediately
conclude that any negative reaction is to the MSG 

I eat lots of Chinese food  I LOVE Chinese food  I've just learned
the following

IF I get food at one of the restaurants that DOES NOT USE MSG or

IF I prepare the food myself without MSG or 

IF I order the food from a restaurant that will hold the MSG and I
never get soup unless it's from a restaurant that cooks without the
MSG

I DO NOT GET A REACTION

OKAY

DO YOU UNDERSTAND

I GET A REACTION FROM MSG

I DO NOT GET A REACTION WHEN THERE IS NO MSG

If you're having trouble understand this please tell me which of the
words you do not understand and I'll look them up in the dictionary
for you

Boy you computer people only know s and s but not much about logic 

No I did not said MSG was not the culprit What I argued was that that
there was enough reasonable doubt to convict MSG  

If you want to convict MSG show me the evidence not quilty by suspicion

Look people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant
I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not Exploiting my last
name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt

What I am interested in is the truth Let me give you an excert from
a recent FDA hearing

           There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect
on the brain'' said Dr Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology The anecdotal experiences of individuals is
superstition not science'' he said I don't think glutamate
has made them sick''

And Dr Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double
blind test in  showing that the  people who reacted to MSG also
had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not

Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group
some of them might have been due to other causes But because the anti MSG
emotion runs so high that some blame it for anything and everything 

My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue although I am probably
 outnumbered

In myopia the cornea is too curved  There is too much of a bulge in the

In PRK the laser removes a small amount of material from the center

In RK the surgeon cuts incisions near the edge  They heal and the scarring
reshapes the cornea

Entirely different mechanisms and the action is in a different place

I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican
which upset me  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain
He suggested medication and a course of treatment and told me that I
need to call him  days after I begin the medication so that he may
monitor its effectiveness as well as my general health

I did exactly as he asked and made the call reaching his secretary
I explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request
and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more
frequent and the medication did not seem effective

The doctor called me back and his first words were Whatever you want
you'd better make it quick  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit
chat with you  I told him I was simply following his instructions to
call on the th day to status him and that I was feeling worse  I 
then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he
had more time  He responded Just spit it out now because no time is
a good time  Said in a raised voice  I started to feel upset and
tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my
nervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered
and then said well never mind and he said he'll talk to various
colleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time

This doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express
myself well he was confused about what I wanted  At this point I
was pretty upset and I told him in an amazingly polite voice considering
how angry I felt that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings  He told
me that he just doesn't have time to rap with patients and thought
that was what I wanted  I told him that to assume I was calling to
rap was insulting and said again that I was just following through
on his orders  He responded that he resented the implication that he 
felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his
patients have to say about their condition status  He then gave me
this apology I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you
mistakenly thought I was insulting  I am not trying to insult you
but I am not that knowledgeable about pain and I don't have a lot of
time to deal with that  He then told me to call him the next day
for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication

I am still upset and have not yet called

My questions  Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care
 Since I am in pain off and on I realize that this may cause me to
be more anxietous so am I perhaps overreacting or overly sensitive
If this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type
of pain I have he still wants me to status him on my condition but
now I am afraid to call him

I have had a sore throat for almost a week  When I look into
the mirror with the aid of a flash light I see white plaques in
the very back of my throat on the sides  I went to a health
center to have a throat culture taken  They said that I do not
have strep throat  Could a viral infection cause white plaques
on the sides of my throat

First I am not a doctor  I know about this because I have been
through it

It sounds like tonsilitis lit swollen tonsils  Feel under your jaw
hinge for a swelling on each side  If you find them its tonsilitis
I've had this a couple of times in the past  The doctor prescribed a
weeks course of penicillin and that cleared it up

In my case it was associated with glandular fever which is a viral
infection which from my point of view resembled flu and tonsilitis
that kept coming back for a year or so  There is a blood test for
this

In conclusion see a doctor if you have not done so already

Purely recreational  They get bored sitting in that

No this is wrong  The purpose is to preserve the substances in
the tubes longer by creating relativistic speeds and thus
time dilatation  Of course by slowing the subjective time of
the test tubes they get less bored which is probably what you

The subjectline says it  every time I run a fever I get an amazing
rosy rash over my torso and arms  Fortunately it doesn't itch

The rash  always comes on the day after the
fever breaks and no matter what the illness was  cold flu whatever
It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current
town although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything

Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever
a severe or longlasting fever brings a longlasting rash  A mild fever
seems to bring rashes that go away faster  

Anybody know what might be causing this  It's no more than an 
embarassment but I'd be curious to know what's going on  Am I carrying
some kind of feverresistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out
its competition

   I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different
   conclusion I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems I went
   with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest and they ordered
   lots of stuff I had never seen before The only thing I can remember of that
   meal was the first course scallops served in the shell with a soytype sauce
   I thought Well I've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that
   could have been a coincidence That night as I sat on the bathroom floor
   sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way I decided I would never touch
   another scallop I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance

I don't react to scallops but did have discomforts with clam juice
served at American waterfront seafood bars  I don't know whether
the juice is homemade or from cans

The following is my first encounter with the Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome  Ten years ago about an hour after having Won Ton Soup I
collapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up my scalp
tingling my feet too weak to stand up  The symptoms lasted for about
 minutes  Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction I
went back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish  The
same thing happened  A quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothing
out of the ordinary

I've also had a mild attack after having soup at a Thai restuarant

 Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common  The crucial
 thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren't of any use
 unless they make you do some experiments  I've known a lot of scientists
 whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won't admit
 out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers
 
 Simple example Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA
 electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments  He got very excited hoping that
 he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
 genes  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
 binding assays  The result was a wellconserved  or so bp sequence

But why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy
While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obvious
that his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word was
at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance
of current theory coupled with his observations  It would appear that
something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation
into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation  This
does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of
fancy or a fantasy

 
 It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational  Perhaps
 you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out
 for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first
 advanced from logical grounds  The main examples I can think of are from
 modern highenergy physics which is not typical of science as a whole

Well I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word also
extrascientific etc  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of
rationality  In terms of examples there is some danger of beginning to quibble
over what a surprising experiment is what counts as surprising etc
The same may be said about logical grounds  My point is that quite frequently
perhaps even most frequently the roots of a new theory can be traced to
previously existing theories or even to previously rejected hypotheses of
some other theory or domain  I would offer some rather well known examples
such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his sea of air
hypothesis  Was this theory and the resulting experimental test surprising
Well given the prior explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must
be counted as so  Was the theory constructed and the experiment designed
out of perfectly rational grounds  Well there was a pretty successful and
well know theory of fluids  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit
The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid but this was quite a novelty
at the time  Was the theory interesting  Yes  Was it new  Well one
could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new
domain but I think this begs certain questions  We can debate that if you

can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis   i heard
it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names

Naomi

Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist
outside the uteris  Sometimes this causes problems often it doesn't
There is generally no need to remove pockets of endometriosis unless they are
causing other problems  One lady I know had Endometriosis in an ovary  
This caused her a great deal of pain  Another lady I know has an     
endometrial cyst in her abdominal wall she is not having it removed

The American Fertility Society has information on this and they probably 
maintain a list of physicians in all parts of the continent that deal with
endometriosis  You can reach them at

In order to excitotoxin effects of MSG MSG that in blood must go through 
bloodbrain barrier that I am not sure MSG can go through or not In normal condition the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about 
 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptorthe NMDA
receptor But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons 

Glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system It is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement it is alsoinvolved in develpoment memory and learn it is involved in Lognterm potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning

Um I hate to break this to you but article numbers are unique per site
They have no meaning on other machines

You mean the responses some of which pointed to doubleblind tests
which show no such chinese restaurant effect unique to MSG
it's elicited by the placebo as well

Yet again the use of this
newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters

Like youself  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently
come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to
do with the use of this substance in human nutrition

For cites on MSG look up almost anything by John W Olney a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive

No it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid
which is an excitatory neurotransmitter  There is also evidence that
excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain
conditions like stroke drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease just to name a few
This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid
in foods  People are not receiving intraventricular injections of glutamate

and that its major constituent glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
humans included

I don't know about premier but it's certainly an important one

Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown off

Sez you  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any
controlled studies  Infant mice and other models are useful as far
as they go but they're not relevant to the matter at hand  Which is
not to say that I favor its use in things like baby fooda patently
ridiculous use of the additive  But we have no reason to believe
that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely

Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food

Wrong  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink
Milligrams worth  Compare that to a glass of milk  Do you know how much
glutamate is present in most proteincontaining foods compared to that
added by the use of MSG

By eating lots of junk food
packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous real physilogical effects 

Notice the subtle covering of her ass here anyone with a sensitivity
We're disputing the size of that class

Read Olney's review paper in Prog Brain Res  and check his
sources They are impecable There is no dispute

Impeccable  There most certainly is a dispute

I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in
this thread  In case this puzzles people I would like to expand
on two of her comments

In article CJoDHIGnewsHawaiiEdu ladyuhunixuhccHawaiiEdu Lee Lady writes
 Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable  However it is also 
 widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity 
  In the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all
 the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave
 the house  

One of the most important and difficult aspects of reasoning
about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context
scope and importance of the various arguments and pieces of
evidence that are marshalled for a claim  Some errors break the
back of a piece of research some leave a hole that needs to be
filled in and some are trivial in their importance  It is a
grave mistake to confuse these

Past snippets from this thread

 I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology  

 He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would
 distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from
 one in which it does not 

Back to Lee Lady

 These are not the rules according to many who post to scimed and
 scipsychology  According to these posters  If it's not supported by
 carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science

These posters are making the mistake that I have previously
criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe  A carefully
designed and controlled study is neither always possible nor
always important  On the other hand if someone is proposing a
remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem we
have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued this kind
of claim to ask for a carefully designed and controlled study
to alleviate our skepticism

Rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and
controlled study are too narrow to apply to all investigation
I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be
convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have
occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things  To
reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from
uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical
problems are notoriously problematic

 genes  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
 binding assays  The result was a wellconserved  or so bp sequence

But why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy

The fantasy was that he had found something of fundamental importance to
one of the hot questions of the day '  He really had very little
reason to believe it other than raw hope  By fantasy I certainly don't
mean Velikovskian manias

some other theory or domain  I would offer some rather well known examples
such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his
sea of air hypothesis

I'm not familiar with the history of this experiment although arguably
I should be

surprising
Well given the prior explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly
be counted as so  Was the theory constructed and the experiment designed
out of perfectly rational grounds  Well there was a pretty successful and

like

I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising
That's not what I'd quibble about  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's
reasons for doing his experiment not the post hoc constructed reasons
but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem  It may be
impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts that's too bad if
it is so  One of RootBernstein's services to science is that he has gone
rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's and other people's notes and has
discovered some surprising clues about their motivations  Pasteur never
publicly admitted his plan to create mirrorimage life but the dreams are
right there in his notebooks finally public after many years ready for
anyone to read  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous
reasons for pursuing results one of my best came because I was mad at
a colleague for a poorlywritten claim I disproved the claim

Of course Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety where the
fantasy not only motivates the experiment but turns out to be right
in the end

    INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER
    


The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language
courses this summer  Both courses Intensive Elementary Japanese and 
Intensive Intermediate Japanese are ten week ten credit courses 
each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study  They begin 
June  and end August   The courses meet five days per week five hours 
per day  There is a flat rate tuition charge of  per course  
Fellowships available for science and engineering students  Contact 
Steven Brener Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology
Management Program at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or
address below  
ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS



  


   New Program Announcement   



            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program JSTMP is a new
program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon 
University  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific 
communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June  and 
January 


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the 
United States  It is also designed to let scientists engineers and managers
experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development  This is 
facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and
laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop
longterm professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts


PROGRAM DESIGN
To fulfill the objectives of the program participants will be required to 
develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and
its culture  Correspondingly JSTMP consists of three major components

 TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE
Several Japanese language courses will be offered including intensive courses
designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a
relatively short time

 EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE
A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the
cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in 
manufacturing and information technology  Courses will be available in a 
variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology
Sociology History and Political Science  Moreover seminars and colloquiums
will be conducted  Further a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or 
research facilities in the United States will be scheduled


 AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN
Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU 
participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe
and participate in the management of technology  Internships in Japan
will generally run for one year however shorter ones are possible


FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES AS WELL AS
STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE

generation to accept genetic manipulation  It seems that people frown
upon 'messing with Nature' ignoring our eonsold practice of doing just that
Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation
we routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'

	 Most interesting human traits will probably be massively
polygenetic and be full of tradeoffs  In addition without a positive
social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts having them won't
be the advantage it's made out to be  Some people will certainly pursue it
as if it is the Grail but we know how most of those quests turn out

 I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in
 network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going
 to describe here  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced
 a seizure on November   at AM after eating Kellog's Frosted
 Flakes  She is perfectly healthy had never experienced anything like
 this before and there is no history of seizures in either side of the
 family  All the tests EEG MRI EKG came out negative so the decision
 was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again
 
 Well we were going along fine and the other morning April  she had
 a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal Fruit Loops I am
 embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once
 in a while So I pour it in her bowl and think Oh oh this is the
 same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure  Ten 
 minutes later she had a full blown seizures This was her first exposure
 to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure

My daughter has Epilepsy and I attend a monthly parent support group
Just Wednesday night a mother was telling how she decided to throw
all the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her  yearold's
seizures  He was having about one seizure per week  She reported that
she did this on Thursday  he had a seizure on Saturday and then
went  weeks without a seizure  On Easter he went to Grandma's and ate 
candy pop  anything he wanted  He had a seizure the next day  She 
sees sensitivity to nutrasweet sugar colors caffine and corn  With
corn she says he gets very nervous and aggresive  

With my own daughter age   I think she is also sensitive and stays
away from those foods on her own  She has never had gum won't eat
candy prefers an apple to a cookie doesn't like chocolate and won't
even use toothpaste  Her brother on the other hand is a junk food
addict  

Hope this helps  Good Luck

Digression   Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors

Although the miracle berry a plant native to West Africa is practically
tasteless it temporarily changes the taste of other substances  Miracle
berries contain a protein miraculin that modifies sweet receptors in
such a way that they can be stimulated by acids Bartoshuk Gentile 
Moskowitz  Meiselman   If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle
berry and I do recommend it for about the next half an hour all acids 
which are normally sour will taste sweet  They will continue to taste
sour as well

Miraculin was for a time commercially available in the United States as a
diet aid  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin
pill and then eat and drink unsweetened slightly acidic substances  Such
substances would taste sweet without providing many calories

A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries
We drank straight lemon juice sauerkraut juice even vinegar  All tasted
extremely sweet  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are  We 
awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers

 continued discussion of a couple other tastealtering substances

I posted this to scipsychology on April  and after seeing
your post here on panice disorder thought it would be
relevant



My research indicates that two schools of thought exist
the literature promoting medication says it's the superior
treatment  Not surprisingly literature promoting cognitive
therapy also claims to be superior

What are the facts  Early in my research I didn't have a
bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy  I
was interested in a treatment that worked  After reading
journals published after  the cognitive therapy camp
claims a higher success rate approx  a lower dropout
rate and no side effects associated with medication

LarsGoran Ost published an excellent article titled
Applied Relaxation Description of a coping technique and
a review of controlled studies  This is from Behav Res Ther
vol  no  pp    The article provides
instructions on how to perform applied relaxation AR
Briefly you start with two  minute sessions daily and
progress in  weeks to performing  thirty second sessions
daily

I'll snail mail this article to anyone interested USA only please

I'm told that corn allergy is fairly common  My wife has it and it seems
to be exacerbated if sugar is eaten with the corn

I suppose that in a person just on the verge of having epilepsy an
allergic reaction might cause a seizure but I don't really know

 And you're condemning one particular ingredient without any 
 evidence that that's the ingredient to which you reacted

Believe what you will

The mass of anectdotal evidence combined with the lack of
a properly constructed scientific experiment disproving
the hypothesis makes the MSG reaction hypothesis the
most likely explanation for events

 What we are really worried about is not knowing the facts The doctor 
 has stated that things will not be good if she is a carrier and avoids 
 further questions on the subject We really would like to know so we 
 can take steps and plan in advance for any eventualities
 
 Thankyou for your very informative post Right now I am just trying 
 to find out everything that I can
 
                         Russ

Unfortunately Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and
subsequent cirrhosis  Although not many patients with Hep B go on to
chronic hepatitis it does still occur in a good number  and is
something to keep in mind  Hepatitis C was nonA nonB Hep much
more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis  There is also an
autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which
also leads to cirrhosis  

Of course cirrhosis is a most unkind disease  The most dangerous
effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function 
Patients develop lifethreatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas
among many other problems as a result of disturbances in hepatic
circulation  Less ominously they can exhibit the effects of
hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis 
These effects include telangiactasias small red skin lesions and in
men gynecomastia breast development  The only real treatment for
cirrhosis is liver transplant

Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected at least statistically in
your friend's case  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the
subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor  Hopefully he
or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to
you and offer you support

SP From paulsontablarcnasagov Sharon Paulson
SP to describe here  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced
SP a seizure on November   at AM after eating Kellog's Frosted
SP Flakes

SP Well we were going along fine and the other morning April  she had
SP a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal Fruit Loops I am

SP When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for
SP the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea  Now
SP after this second episode so similar in nature to the first even
SP he is scratching his head

There's no data that sugarcoated cereals cause seizures  I haven't
even seen anything anecdotal on it  Given how common they are eaten
 do you know any child or adolescent who doesn't eat the stuff 
I think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now
Also there's nothing weird in those cereals  As far as the brain
is concerned except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as
galactosemia sugar is sugar regardless if it is coated on cereal
sprinkled onto cereal or dissolved in soda coffee or whatever

There was some interest a few years ago in aspartame lowering
seizure thresholds but I don't believe anything ever came of it

GB From gebcspittedu Gordon Banks
GB The HMO would stop the overordering but in HMOs tests are
GB underordered

That's a somewhat overbroad statement  I'm sure there are HMOs in
which the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctor's
income  In most however including the one I work for there is no
direct incentive to underorder  Profits of the group are shared
among all partners but the group is so large that an individual's
generated costs have a miniscule effect  I don't believe that we
underorder  Then again I'm not really sure what the right amount
of ordering is or should be  Relative to the average British
neurologist I suspect that I rather drastically overorder

mhollowaicsunysbedu Michael Holloway writes

Here's your error  I really do think this shows some confusion on your
part  Drum roll please  Science isn't so much the gathering of evidence
to support an assertion read hypothesis as it is the gathering of
empirical observations IN ORDER TO MAKE AN HYPOTHESIS  What should
convince you or not shouldn't be the final product so much as HOW the
product was made 

Here's your error There is no observation or hypothesis that is not tainted
by theory I have a theory I make observations those observations will be
made with my theory in mind 

Yes absolutely though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of
all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various
biases 

But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back once again 
to equating the business of science with the end result the gizmo produced

Science works very well at developing theories
within paradigms but is very poor at dealing with paradigm shifts If I 
develop a novel paradigm that explains homeopathy chinese medicine or 
spontaneous combustion If the paradigm is useful it will show me the way
to make observations that prove or disprove it

My point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but how 
you come about developing it

The paradigm of modern medicine is that the body can be reduced to a set of
essentially mechanical operations wherein disease is seen as malfunctions in
the machinery essentially the old Newtonian model of the world It seems
likely that theories based upon this paradigm do not give a complete 
discription of the universe medicine healing etc Indeed we now 
recognize an important psychological component to healing 

Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part the topic
of the philosophy of science is made for them I'm making them too but I
think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the 
business of doing science  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic 
assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific
research  That is that you make empirical observations form an hypothesis
and test it  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than 
the old Newtonian model of the world  And I doubt that many psychologists
would appreciate being put outside this empirical world view  Psychology
also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending 

It is also important to distinguish reason from science Science may be
reasonable but so are many nonscientific methodologies Aristotle reasoned
that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle 

Oversimplified of course but a good example  This is an empirical observa
tion  It was then tested though perhaps not by Aristotle and eventually 
found wanting  In the meantime some folk will 
have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life  
There's nothing at all surprising about this it's the way the gathering of
knowledge works  There are probably more than a few things in my own 
discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally offbase
even idiotic to someone in the future  These future people won't have come
to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zenlike and had 
a vision in an LSD trip  Someone will have thought of something new and 
tested it  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting
science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around  Science is a 
creative process  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally
turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories  

Again I think it gets down to defining what you mean by science  I often
don't recognize what it is that I do and am involved in in the way science
is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities  They
portray science as a collection of immutable facts pronouncements of TRUTH
in big gold letters  That's silly  Its as though we just go into the lab
turn over a stone and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula
tion  Its much more interesting than that  It really is a very human
process

 Organ donors are healthy people who have died suddenly usually 
 through accident or head injury  They are brain dead  The 
 organs are kept alive through mechanical means

OK so how do you define healthy people

My wife cannot donate blood because she has been to a malarial region
in the past three years  In fact she tried to have her bone marrow
typed and they wouldn't even do that  Why

I can't donate blood either because not only have I been to a malarial
region but I have also been diagnosed and surgically treated for
testicular cancer  The blood bank wont accept blood from me for 
years  

Obviously it wouldn't be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly 
introducing another  Cancer mestastizes  My imperfect understanding of 
the facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard 
I haven't done the research on it but I don't recall ever hearing of a 
case of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion  Probably just a 
common sense kind of arbitrary precaution  Transmissable diseases like 
malaria though are obviously another story

In article Aprcunewscarletonca wcsbeaualfredcarletonca OPIRG writes

For cites on MSG look up almost anything by John W Olney a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive and that its major constituent glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
humans included  Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown
off  Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food  By eating lots of junk food
packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous real physilogical effects 
Read Olney's review paper in Prog Brain Res  and check his
sources They are impecable There is no dispute

                    Dianne Murray    wcsbeauccscarletonca

In order to excitotoxin effects of MSG MSG that in blood must go through 
bloodbrain barrier that I am not sure MSG can go through or not

Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the
Bloodbrain barrier through the circumventricular organs or CVO in
particular the adeno and neurohypophysis pituitary gland areas  The
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence regions
are particularly effected  CVO areas are not subject to the
bloodbrain barrier These areas control the release of gonadotropin
which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development
especially sexual development Changes in adult rats which are less
sensitive to Glu than humans have been observed after ingesting Glu
on a chronic basis cycles of several steroids are disrupted Blood
levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced and cyclic release
of steroids becomes flattened

A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post
the following information

A few weeks ago she noticed that some of her hair was starting
to fall out  She would touch her head and strands of hair would
just fall right out by the way she is  or  years old  
It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the
size of a half dollar  Since that time she  has gotten two
more bald spots of the same size  Other symptoms she's
described include  several months of an irregular menstrual
cycle which is strange for her because she has always been
extremely regular laryngitis every few days  she will wake
up one morning and have almost no voice and then the next day
it's fine dizzy spells  she claims that she's had  or 
very bad dizzy spells early in the morning including one that
knocked her to the ground and general fatigue

She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason
for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected
thyroid problems  He did the blood work and claims that everything
came back normal  

She's very concerned and very confused  Does anyone have any
ideas or suggestions  I told her that I thought she should
see an endocrinologist  Does that sound like the right idea

 By the way in case you are going to askno she has recently
taken any medications that would cause these symptomsno she hasn't
recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm 
coloring or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall
out

Thanks in advance for any help

Furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is
one of the most significant errors in science  choosing to investigate
questions because they can be readily handled by the currently
fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional
or corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention to
those questions which seem to have fundamental significance

Shades of James Watson  That's exactly the way many workers have described
their misgivings about the Human Genome Project  If you take a rigid 
definition of scientific research the mere accumulation of data is not 
doing science  One of the early arguments against the project were that the 
resources would be better used to focus on specific geneticsrelated 
problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence  
The project can't be so narrowly defined or easily described now though

Having had limited tinea pedis for more than  years and finding
it resistant to ALL creams and powders I have tried I wonder why
dermatologists do not use lasers to destroy the fungus It would
seem likely to be effective and inexpensive Are there good reasons
for not using lasers
I was told that dermatology had not yet reached the laser age

I have bad luck and got a VD called Granuloma ingunale which involves
the growth of granules in the groin  I found out about it by checking medicine
books and I found the prescriptions  And I know I can just go to a clinic to
get it cured  BUT unfortunately I am serving my duty in the army right now and
I think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if I take leaves 
every day for two weeks for treatment  Thus I bought the prescribed tablets
at some drugstore but to cure it I must get INJECTION of Streptomycin with
a dose of g every  hours for at least  days  I can probably buy the 
tools and this solution somewhere but I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELF

Can any kind people here tell me

If it's possible to do it Can I do it on my arm or it must be done on the hip
only  Any info is welcome and please write me or post your help SOON I am
already taking the tablets and I can't wait

Please don't flame me for posting this and don't judge me I've learned a 
lesson and all I need now is REAL MEDICAL HELP

   Well if that's the case in YOUR practice I have a hard time 
   figuring out how you even managed to make it into the bottom half
   of your class or did you create your diplomas with crayons
 
   If someone runs a medical practice with only a  success rate
   they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified to
   treat or they have no conscience and are only in business for
   fraudulent purposes

   OTOH who are we kidding the New England Medical Journal in 
   ran the heading Ninety Percent of Diseases are not Treatable by
   Drugs or Surgery which has been echoed by several other reports
   No wonder MDs are not amused with alternative medicine since
   the  magic of the placebo effect would award alternative 
   practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine

GR RR Well Gordon I look at the RESULTS not at anyone's scientific
GR RR stamp of approval
GR  
GR    If you and your patients followers are convinced as you've written
GR  by your methods of uncontrolled undocumented unreported unsubstantiated
GR  subjective endpoint research  great  But why should the rest of us care

 Gordon even if you are trying to beat this issue to death you'll 
 never get more than a stalemate out of this one
 I have never tried to force my type of medicine on any of you Why 
 should I  My patients are happy I'm happy You and your peers seem 
 to be the only miserable ones around bemoaning the steady loss of 
 patients to the alternative camp
 Just look at Europe There has been a steady exodus from 'synthetic' 
 medicine for over a decade now and it'll be just a matter of time
 before more people on this continent will abandon their drug and white 
 coat worship as well and visit different doctors for different needs

GR     You see Ron the point isn't whether YOU and your patients are
GR  convinced that whatever it is you do works it's whether what you do is
GR  MORE effective in similar cases of whatever it is you think you are
GR  treating than cupping bloodletting and placebo

 This is very interesting I have come exactly to the same conclusions
 but in regards to conventional medicine

 You see I don't just treat little old ladies that wouldn't know any
 different of what is being done but a bulk of my patients consist of
 teachers lawyers judges nurses accountants university graduates
 and various health practitioners
 If these people have gotten results with my method after having been
 unsuccessful with yours or their own I certainly wouldn't lose any 
 sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments  
 let's face it with all the blunders committed by scientific MDs 
 over the years I know a lot of people who hold your scientific 
 method in much lower esteem than they hold mine

GR  As far as we know ayurveda  crystals  homeopathy  Ron Roth
GR  which may all equal placebo administered with appropriate
GR  trappings
     
  Sorry but I'm not familiar OR interested with what appears to be 
 'NEW AGE' medicine ayurveda crystals with the exception of homeo
 pathy of which I took a course But Gordon you already knew that 
 you just wanted to make my system look a bit more far out right
 
 I use homeopathy very little since my cellular test EMR is hard to
 beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable while homeopathy
 does have a problem with reliability especially in acute conditions
 An exception perhaps are homeopathic nosodes which act fairly quickly
 and are more dependable in certain viral or bacterial situations 

GR  My colleagues and I spend hours debating study design
GR  and results even of therapies currently accepted as standard
GR  As good well adequate scientists we are prepared if 
GR  presented with appropriate data to abandon our most deeply held 
GR  beliefs in favor of new ideas

 I have met the challenges of hundreds of sceptics by verifying the
 accuracy of measuring their mineral status to their total satisfac
 tion  in other words EVERYONE INVOLVED is happy
 If you were to cook a meal would you worry over whether EVERYONE 
 in this world would find it to their liking or only those that end 
 up eating it
 Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken 
 entirely myself I don't need to follow any of your rules or guide
 lines to satisfy any aspects of a grant application which YOU may 
 have to neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs 
 meet your or anyone else's criteria or acceptance 

GR    Sorry Ron if conviction were the ruler of truth a flat Earth would
GR  still be the center of the Universe and epilepsy a curse of the gods
                         
 I think there would be more justification for an uneducated person
 growing up in an uncivilized environment to believe in a flat earth
 than for a civilized well educated and scientifically trained mind
 to follow the doctrine of evolution
 Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show God
 how it is properly done Now we've become capable of creating our
 own paradise and give disease and God the boot right

 But just before we get rid of Him for good perhaps He could leave us
 some pointers on how to solve a couple of tiny problems such as war 
 poverty racism crime riots substance abuse And one last thing 
 could He also give us a hint on how to control natural disasters the
 weather and last but not least  peace

Syndrome This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different
symptons  eg chest complaints are treated separately Does anone have
any information on it
 
It would help if you and anyone else asking for medical information on
some subject could ask specific questions as no one is likely to type
in a textbook chapter covering all aspects of the subject  If you are
looking for a comprehensive review ask your local hospital librarian
Most are happy to help with a request of this sort
 
Briefly this is a condition in which patients who have significant
residual weakness from childhood polio notice progression of the
weakness as they get older  One theory is that the remaining motor
neurons have to work harder and so die sooner

 I have been contemplating this idea for some time as well I am not a
 doctor but my wife is a nurse and I know a lot of doctors and nurses
 The point here being that doctors and nurses do not seem to get sick
 nearly as much as people outside the medical profession

This is a lovely area for anecdotes but I am sure you are on to something
As a physician I almost never get sick usually when something horrendous
is going around I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case
When I do get really sick it is always something unusual

This was not the situation when I was in medical school particularly on
pediatrics I never had younger siblings myself and when I went on the
pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious
challenges that my body was not ready for Pediatrics for me was three solid
months of illness and I had a temp of  when I took the final exam

I think what happens is that during training and beyond we are constantly
exposed to new things and we have the usual reactions to them so that later
on when challenged with something it is more likely a reexposure for us
so we deal with it well and get a mild illness I don't think it is that
the immune system is hyped up in any way Also don't forget that the
hospital flora is very different from the home and we carry a lot of that
around

In article Aprcsrochesteredu fulkcsrochesteredu Mark Fulk writes
What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the
impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps
even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around
having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and
petty hatreds

Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common  The crucial
thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren't of any use
unless they make you do some experiments  I've known a lot of scientists
whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won't admit
out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers

The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization 
can end up being far removed from the actual daytoday of the grunt at the
bench  Yes its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the
lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it
as long as my advisor doesn't catch me  which is easy enough to do but 
stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review 
committees and the peer review process in general  In today's world that's 
what determines what science is what gets funded  And a damn good thing to
Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything at 
least not in biomedical research  The surest way for a graduate student to
ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with 
fleshing out hisher fantasies than with having the student work on a project
that actually has a good chance of producing some results  MD's seem to 
be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior  

Simple example Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA
electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments  He got very excited hoping that
he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
genes  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
binding assays  The result was a wellconserved  or so bp sequence
that occurs about  times in the human genome  Unfortunately for
Warren's fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in
so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into
the genome  On the other hand the characteristics of transposons were
much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was
recognized and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created
Other species have different sets of transposons  Fortunately for me
Warren and I used to eat dinner at TGI Fridays all the time

I have to agree with Gary Merrill's response to this  I've read alot of the
Alu and middle repetitive sequence work and it's really very interesting 
good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics  It's 
really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting 
results that were unexpected

 My nearly year old Pomeranian had a nasty reaction to this vaccination
   Suffice it to say we will not
 vaccinate her for Lyme disease again  She's been camping through some 
 states and has backpacked with us as well and we are used to watching for ticks
 and dealing with them and we simply won't take her to really active Lyme
 disease areas

Not to drag this out anymore but

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that
in an endemic area they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs
presenting with lameness swollen joints  fever

A recent paper March  has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs
can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting  This has been
an ellusive matter for researchers and is one of the fundamental requirements
for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease
Up to now only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to prove that
the disease exists

This paper is noteworthy in two other regards

 None of the animals they infected were treated in any way  The dogs
had episodes of lameness during a  week period which occurred 
months after exposure  After this period none showed any further
clinical signs up to the  month observation period of the study  So
these are proven clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous
recovery without the benefit of drug treatment Of course observations
longer than  months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't
have the same chronicity that some see in humans

  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the
vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine  Of course they want
the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine
efficacy

Anyway maybe we will see some independent scientifically sound evaluations
of this vaccine in the next year or so

 Keith is the only person I have ever heard of that keeps the weight
 off without any conscious effort to control eating behavior   most
 of us have to diet a lot to keep from going back to morbid obesity

I attribute my success to several factors

Very low fat  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me
I only eat fruit vegetables and whole grain or bran cereals  I
estimate I only get about  to  percent of my calories from fat

Very little sugar or salt

Very high fiber  Most Americans get about  grams   to  are
recommended  I get between  and   Sometimes   I've heard
of people taking fiber pills  It seems unlikely that pills can
contain enough fiber to make a difference  It would be about as
likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills  Tablets are
just too small unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily

My clean your plate conditioning works for me  Eating the last
 takes half my eating time and gives satiety a chance to catch
up so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else

I don't eat when I'm not hungry unless I'm sure I'll get hungry
shortly and eating won't be practical then

I bike to work  miles a day year round  Fast  I also bike to
stores movies and everywhere else as I've never owned a car
I estimate this burns about  calories a day  It also helps
build and maintain muscle mass prevent insulin resistance diabetes
runs in my family and increase my metabolism  Even so my
metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable
with a temperature in the s F and usually wear a sweater if
it drops to   Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess
ounce  Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that
weigh slightly less than others  But it's easier and cheaper to trim
weight from the rider than from the vehicle

There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically
different from that of most people who have never been fat  Fortunately
it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health

Obviously I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've
done will have the success I did  But I've never yet heard of one who
did try it and didn't succeed

 I think all of us cycle  One's success depends on how large the
 fluctuations in the cycle are  Some people can cycle only  pounds

I'm sure everyone's weight cycles whether or not they've ever been fat
I usually eat extremely little salt  When I do eat something salty
my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds  It comes
off again over a week or two

aspartame rather vigorously for about a year but that issue seems to
have been pushed to the back burner for the last year or so  Apparently
the evidence is not very strong or Pat would still be flailing away

	Human glucose whole blood fasting levels     mgdL

Which are the strips calibrated for  Obviously they measure whole blood

	Indeed they do measure whole blood levels although they are not

	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the

	however results compare reasonably well with laboratory results
	although values below  mgdL tend to be lower with strip tests
	whereas values above  mgdL can be very erratic

What is the conversion factor between human plasma glucose and
whole blood pin prick glucose concentration

	As stated above whole blood levels tend to be roughly  to  
	percent lower than serum levels  Sample freshness will affect
	whole blood levels however  I don't believe there is a well

Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses

You mean the responses some of which pointed to doubleblind tests
which show no such chinese restaurant effect unique to MSG
it's elicited by the placebo as well

Many people responded with more anecdotal stories I think its safe to
say the original poster is already familiar with such stories
Presumably he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about
MSG making people ill 

Similarly debunking such claims without doing research whether
literature and lab is equally beside the point The original poster
no doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome' is bogus

Placebos are all very interesting but irrelevant to the question of
what effects MSG has You could have real effects and placebo
effects people may have allergies in addition 


Yet again the use of this
newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters
they have substantial knowledge of

Like youself  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently
come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to
do with the use of this substance in human nutrition

Have you read Olney's work I fail to see how citing results from
peerreviewed studies qualifies as bizarrely cracked

For cites on MSG look up almost anything by John W Olney a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive

No it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid
which is an excitatory neurotransmitter  There is also evidence that
excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain
conditions like stroke drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease just to name a few
This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid
in foods  People are not receiving intraventricular injections of glutamate

Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as well I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intraventricular  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally Some studies used IV and SC
Intraventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies
for obvious reasons You must not have read the peerreviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk

Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown off

Sez you  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any
controlled studies  Infant mice and other models are useful as far
as they go but they're not relevant to the matter at hand  Which is
not to say that I favor its use in things like baby fooda patently
ridiculous use of the additive  But we have no reason to believe
that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely

Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the
journals Have you done a thorough literature search

But you're right mice aren't the best to study this on They're four
times less sensitive than humans to MSG

Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food

Wrong  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink
Milligrams worth  Compare that to a glass of milk  Do you know how much
glutamate is present in most proteincontaining foods compared to that
added by the use of MSG

The point is exceeding the window Of course they're amino acids
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine

Olney's research compared infant human diets Specifically the amount
of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods
vs typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least fourfold in a single meal of processed
foods Mother's milk was well below the effective dose


Read Olney's review paper in Prog Brain Res  and check his
sources They are impecable There is no dispute

Impeccable  There most certainly is a dispute

Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you
provide peerreviewed nonfoodindustryfunded citations to articles
disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever

Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than
sugar  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces 
when it degrades nutrasweet  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to

substances  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde
produced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic to
living cells  All I can say is that I will not consume it  

Phenylalanine is
nothing for you to worry about  It is an amino acid and everyone uses small
quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body  Some people have a disease
known as phenylketoneurea and they are missing the enzyme necessary to 
degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body  For them it will 
accumulate in the body and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve
cells  Therefore it is Only a major problem in young children until around
age  or so or women who are pregnant and have this disorder  It used to
be a leading cause of brain damage in infants but now it can be easily 
detected at birth and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine
as a child or when pregnant

Yeah the Feingold Diet is a load of crap  Children diagnosed with ADD

 Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common  The crucial
 thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren't of any use
 unless they make you do some experiments  
 
 Simple example Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA
 electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments  He got very excited 

But why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy
While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obvious
that his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word was
at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance
of current theory coupled with his observations  It would appear that
something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation
into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation  

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window or
dreaming or having a fantasy  or watching an apple fall Newton or
sitting in a bath Archimedes  it is ultimately the result of a lot of
intense scientific thinking done beforehand  Letting one's mind roam
freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming
up with new ideas but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis
of the problem first  

Scientific intuition is not something one is born with  It is something
that one learns  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned
but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the 
key elements in developing it  

Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new
scientific ideas  One thinks for instance of Darwin's naturalistic
studies in the Galapagos islands which led him to the ideas for the 
theory of evolution  

This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes
empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal
exploration as important scientific work  I agree that mere speculation
does not deserve to be called science  I also think that mere empirical
studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very
poor kind of science

I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes
   Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great
science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre
science that makes smaller steps  In most of this thread I have
been concerned with the difference between what is science and
what is not 

I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some of the
activities that lead to really important science  namely thinking and
informal exploration  are not recognized as scientific work  


In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems 
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

My family doctor and the physiotherapist PT she sent me to agree that the
pain in my left shoulder is bursitis I have an appointment with an orthpod
I love that it's short for 'orthopedic surgeon apparently but while I'm
waiting the PT is treating me

She's using hot packs ultrasound and lasers but there's no improvement
yet In fact I almost suspect it's getting worse

My real question is about the laser treatment I can't easily imagine what
the physical effect that could have on a deep tissue problem Can anyone
shed some light so to speak on the matter

  see the ulterior motive here  It is easy for me to see it the
  those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything
  There is a lot of money involved
 
 	You keep bringing this up But I don't understand what's in it
 financially for the physician to go ahead and treat Unless the physician
 has an investment in or is involved in some kickback scheme with the
 home infusion company where is the financial gain for the doctor
 
 Well let me put it this way based on my own experience  A
 general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases
 by establishing links to the Lyme community treating patients
 who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they
 have lyme as if they did saying that diseases such as MS
 are probably spirochetal if not Lyme giving talks at meetings
 of users groups validating the feelings of even delusional
 patients etc  This GP can go from being a runofthemill
 Kyr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital
 and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his
 office and making lots of bread  Also getting the adulation
 of many who believe his is their only hope if not of cure
 then of control and seeing his name in publications put out
 by support groups etc  This is a definite temptation

	Harumph Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something
to aspire to 
	I can't really argue with your logic though I think you may be
extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of
one Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true it is
not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who
treat Lyme disease
	By your logic I could conclude that all of the physicians who
consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to
Lyme patients are doing it for the money rather than because they believe
they are encouraging good medicine I have no idea how sincere these guys
are but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for
what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment
	I would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issues
in Lyme rather than speculating as to the motives of the various parties
involved

NEXT MEETING


The next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL  at  pm at the Knights 
of Columbus Emerald Manor  Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale  
Our guest speaker will be Dr Lewis Teperman  Dr Teperman 
trained in Pittsburgh under Dr Starzl and is now the Assistant 
Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University 
Medical Center  Dr Teperman will discuss current trends in 
transplantation and treatment and will answer questions  He is 
a long time friend of TRIO surgeon to many of our members and 
always a gracious and delightful guest   It is sure to be a 
very informative interesting and engaging evening  Our 
hospitality committee  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence 
will be well prepared and at last the weather should be 
cooperative We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome 
Dr Teperman 

          WEDNESDAY    APRIL   K of C   UNIONDALE


LAST MEETING

It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of 
TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather being 
able to forecast rain sleet and snow fully a month in advance  
No TV weatherman can match us This time we not only scored 
again but we were also able to disable the Long Island 
Railroad making travel REALLY difficult  None the less many 
braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good 
conversation  Our scheduled speaker Mrs Elizabeth Linnehan 
a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not 
able to attend  She hope she will be with us in the fall to 
discuss diet and medications  However  Ms Jennifer Friedman 
an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient 
was kind enough to step in on very short notice  Ms Friedman 
gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup 
even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to 
minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine 
and drugs we take  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank 
her for an entertaining evening



ANNUAL MEETING

In addition to welcoming Dr Teperman the April meeting is 
also the Annual meeting of the Chapter  This is the official 
notice of the meeting as required by our ByLaws The main 
purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit 
member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs and 
to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two 
year term  The nominating committee has prepared the following 
slate for the Board

         Anne Liver Recipient and Don Treffeisen
         Robert Heart Recipient and Eulene Smith
         Vito Kidney Recipient and Bette Suglia
         Kay Grenzig Liver Recipient
         Jan Schichtel Kidney Recipient
         Larry Juliano Kidney Recipient
         David Bekofsky Director Public Education LITP

Those remaining on the Board for another year are

         Robert Carroll Liver Kidney  Pancreas Recipient
         Jerry Kidney Recipient and Jeanne Eichhorn
         Ron Kidney Donor and Marie Healy
         Peter Smith Bone Marrow Recipient
         Patricia Ann Yankus Kidney and Pancreas Recipient
         Walter Ruzak Kidney Recipient

This may seem to be a big Board but many hands make light work 
and with our various medical uncertainties it is good to have 
backups for all the jobs on the Board  Therefore in addition 
to the slate being presented for voting nominations will also 
be accepted from the floor  There is no set number of Board 
members and there is plenty of work 

In addition  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be 
given and the floor will be open for any new business 
suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring up

We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the 
majority of the time with Dr Teperman

FUTURE MEETINGS

Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year  

     May        Dr Peter Shaprio Chief of Psychiatry
                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center

     June        Dr Felix Rappaport Director of the Stony 
                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program 

Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month

NOTDAW

The week of April  is National Organ and Tissue Donor 
Awareness Week NOTDAW While we are planning news releases 
speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and 
Gaffney we have decided not to have our softball game   
because of two year's experience with miserable weather 

We all can help spread the word on donor awareness however We 
have found it effective to ask your pastor or rabbi to publish 
a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin allow you to 
address the congregation or include mention of the gift of 
life in his sermon  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample 
letter and fact sheet you can use   Thank you

Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide so a product of its

formaldehyde  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of
aspartamecontaining foods are completely in the metabolic noise
since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other
components of food all the time  In studies involving administration
of high doses of the additive blood methanol levels were undetectable
Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings
say ml and above  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde
and formic acid two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels
can damage tissues like the retina and kidney because at such high doses
the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed  Interestingly one
treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on
ethyl alcoholvodka or an equivalent  That's because ethanol is
metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver
If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde

Many people responded with more anecdotal stories I think its safe to
say the original poster is already familiar with such stories
Presumably he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about
MSG making people ill 

There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill
That's the point after all

Like youself  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently
come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to
do with the use of this substance in human nutrition
Have you read Olney's work I fail to see how citing results from
peerreviewed studies qualifies as bizarrely cracked

That's because these peerreviewed studies are not addressing
the effects of MSG in people they're looking at animal models
You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and
doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects
demonstrated in humans  Note that I wouldn't have any argument
with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro
duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its
use in humans  This is precisely NOT what you said

Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as well I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intraventricular  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally Some studies used IV and SC
Intraventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies
for obvious reasons You must not have read the peerreviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk

It most certainly is for neurotoxicology  You know studies of
glutamate involve more than food science

Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the
journals Have you done a thorough literature search

So point us to the studies in humans please  I'm familiar with
the literature and I've never seen any which relate at all to
Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons

The point is exceeding the window Of course they're amino acids
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine

Well actually they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine it's a
essential amino acid  They just try to get as little as is healthy
without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites
in the blood

Olney's research compared infant human diets Specifically the amount
of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods
vs typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least fourfold in a single meal of processed
foods Mother's milk was well below the effective dose

Goodness I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of
glutamatesupplemented foods  It's just that this projected safety
margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that
you can prove anything you like  We're talking prudent policy in
infant nutrition here yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom

Read Olney's review paper in Prog Brain Res  and check his
sources They are impecable There is no dispute

Impeccable  There most certainly is a dispute

Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you
provide peerreviewed nonfoodindustryfunded citations to articles
disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever 

You mean asserting  You're being intellectually dishonest or just
plain confused because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily
have anything to do with each other  Olney's reports would argue a potential
for problems in human infants but that's not to say that this says anything
whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods nor does he provide any
studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious
reasons  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon
of the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome  It says nothing about the frequent
inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab

Does anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency My younger brothers
each tried a skin transplant thigh to nose lining but their nosebleeds
soon returned I've seen a reference to an herb called Rutin that is
supposed to help and I'd like to hear of experiences with it or other
techniques

Rutin is a bioflavonoid compounds found among other places in the
rinds of citrus fruits  These have been popular especially in Europe
to treat capillary fragility and seemingly in even more extreme cases
a few months ago a friend was visiting from Italy and he said that he'd
had hemorrhoids but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills  Incredulously
I asked to look at them and sure enough these contained rutin as the active
ingredient  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical
sputtering  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoidwise these days
The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in
human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled so the
reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal

This stuff is pretty much nontoxic and probably inexpensive so there's
little risk of trying it but I wouldn't expect much of a result

Is there such a thing as MSG monosodium glutamate sensitivity
Superstition Anybody here have experience to the contrary

 
As a person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids are
too I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE FOOD INDUSTRY WANTS TO PUT MSG IN FOOD

Somebody in the industry GIVE ME SOME REASONS WHY  

IS IT AN INDUSTRIAL BYPRODUCT THAT NEEDS GETTING GET RID OF

IS IT TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT THE RECIPES ARE NOT VERY GOOD OR THE FOOD IS POOR QUALITY

DO SOME OF YOU GET A SADISTIC PLEASURE OUT OF MAKING SOME OF US SICK

DO THE TASTE TESTERS HAVE SOME DEFECT IN THEIR FLAVOR SENSORS MOUTH etc
  THAT MSG CORRECTS

I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND

ALSO  Nitrosiamines sp and sulfites   Why them  There are
 safer ways to preserve food wines and beers

I think 
 outlaw the use of these substances without warning labels as
large as those on cig packages
 Require  of comparable products on the market to be free of these
substances and state that they are free of MSG DYES NITROSIAMINES and SULFITES on the package
 While at it outlaw yellow dye   For that matter why dye food  
 Take the dyes and flavorings out of vitamins  In my OSCO only Stress
Tabs tm didn't have yellow dye    My doctor says Yellow Dye  is
responsible for  of all nasal polyps  

KEEP FOOD FOOD  QUIT PUTTING IN JUNK

JUST MY TWO CENTS WORTH

I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in
this thread  

Gee  Maybe I've misjudged you Russell  Anyone who agrees with something 
I say can't be all bad  

Seriously I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not in one respect  
I still have a major problem though with your insistence that science 
is mainly about avoiding mistakes  And I still disagree with your 
contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed scientific 
can possibly know what's true and what's not  

  Deleted material which I agree with  

Back to Lee Lady

 These are not the rules according to many who post to scimed and
 scipsychology  According to these posters  If it's not supported by
 carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science

These posters are making the mistake that I have previously
criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe  A carefully 
       
Rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and
controlled study are too narrow to apply to all investigation
I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be
convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have
occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things  To
reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from
uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical
problems are notoriously problematic  

Okay so let's see if we agree on this FIRST of all there are degrees 
of certainty  It might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully 
controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the 
extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain 
treatment On the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even 
if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that
a treatment is useful  This is often the best evidence we can hope for
from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support
In this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible
but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are
qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing

SECONDLY it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of 
evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal  


I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a
mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in scipsychology and
occasionally in scimed about NLP Neurolinguistic Programming  Much
of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as
informal exploration than as careful scientific research  For years
now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to
just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of
the videotapes courtesy of your local university library  Not for
the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the
NLP methodology especially the approach to eliciting information from
subjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of
scientific interest  And most especially to be aware of the
questions NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific
investigation

Over and over again the response I get in scipychology is  If this
hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical
research then it can't be of any interest to us  

To me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme There've got to
be controlled studies position is an NLP technique called the Fast
PhobiaTrauma Cure

Simple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the world's most 
important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that 
it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell 
when someone is cured of one  The NLP phobia cure is a simple 
visualization which requires less than  minutes  NLPers claim that
it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is
useful in treating Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome  It is essentially
a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral
therapists  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once
or in the case of PTSD once for each traumatic incident  The
process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to
practice it over again at home

Now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure 
Especially if as NLPers claim the success rate is extremely high  
Take someone with a fear of heights as I used to have  Take them up 
to a balcony on the th floor and observe their response  Spend  
minutes to have them do the simple visualization  Send them back up to 
the balcony and see if things have changed  Check back with them in a 
few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting  More long term 
followup is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view 
even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance  In any case 
there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years  To the best 
of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed 
after holding for a few weeks  My own cure incidentally was done
with a slightly different NLP technique before I learned of the Fast 
PhobiaTrauma Cure  Ten years later now I enjoy living on the th
floor of my building and having a large balcony  

The folks over in scipsychology have a hundred and one excuses not to
make this simple test  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study
will be satisfactory  a study of the sort that NLP practitioners 
many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill 
afford to do  Most of them are also just plain not interested because 
the whole idea seems frivolous  And since they're not part of the
scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain 
from scientific acceptance 

The Fast PhobiaTrauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical 
psychology establishment is still saying We don't have any way of 
knowing that it's effective  

These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate 
as anyone could want of course but they say  Why should I prove your 
theory  and  The burden of proof is on the one making the claim  
One academic in scipsychology said that it would be completely 
unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't 
been described in a scientific journal  It's described in a number of 
books and I've posted articles in scipsychology describing it in as much 
detail as I'm capable of  

Actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with 
favorable results but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a
doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal

To me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it  
This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about doctrinnaire 
attitudes about science  

Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you Russell  
If so I apologize 
 

In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems 
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

Some recent postings remind me that I had read about risks 
associated with the barbecuing of foods namely that carcinogens 
are generated Is this a valid concern If so is it a function 
of the smoke or the elevated temperatures Is it a function of 
the cooking elements wood or charcoal vs lava rocks I wish 
to know more Thanks 

I recall that the issue is that fat on the meat liquifies and then
drips down onto the hot elementswhatever they arethat the extreme
heat then catalyzes something in the fat into one or more
carcinogens which then are carried back up onto the meat in the smoke

This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw  Today he
smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot  He used a strange technique
I'd never seen before

He took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil
The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffeetable ash tray
made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges

In the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar
quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of two
teabags of Earl Grey tea and a few cloves

On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum baskettype steamer with
two chicken breasts in it  The lid was put on and the whole assembly
went on the stovetop at high heat for  or  minutes

Later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts  What surprises
and concerns me are

  No wood chips  Where does the smoke flavor come from

  About  or  years ago I remember hearing that carmel color
    obtained by caramelizing sugar  a common coloring and flavoring
    agent had been found to be carcinogenic  I believe they injected
    it under the skin of rats or something  If the results were conclusive
    caramel color would not be legal in the US yet it is still being
    used  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what

  About  or  years ago I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated
    as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract
    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit  Does anyone know whatever
    happened with that story  If it were carcinogenic Earl Grey tea
    could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do
    so

WRT natural wood smoke I've smoking a duck right now as it happens
I've noticed that a heavilysmoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy
taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently
stopped flowing  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips
getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process
then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips

My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are lowmolecular weight
stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort
of larger molecule more similar to tar  The long barbeque time after
the initial intensive smoke drives off the lowmolecular weight stuff
just leaving the flavor behind  Does anyone know if my theory is correct

I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping
on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic  For that reason and because
it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess I only grill
nondrippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals  I do stuff like this
duck by indirect heat  I have a long rectangular Weber and I put the coals
at one end and the meat at the other end  The fat drops directly on the
floor below the meat and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire
in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals

And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that
smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains
nitrosamines which are carcinogenic  I'm pretty sure this claim actually
has some standing don't know about the others

An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal when it was
discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting
a lot of ethylene dibromide EDB into the cake mix to suppress weevils
This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic
The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended
himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day
for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal
broiled steaks  What a great analogy  When I first heard that my
immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit  One charcoal
broiled steak would be equivalent to  Duncans

Okay Mr Dyer we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and

However I believe that all you were asked to do was simply provide scientific
research refuting the work of Olney I don't think the original poster sought

Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than
sugar  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces 
when it degrades nutrasweet  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to
for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate 
substances  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde
produced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic to
living cells  All I can say is that I will not consume it  

Phenylalanine is
nothing for you to worry about  It is an amino acid and everyone uses small
quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body  Some people have a disease
known as phenylketoneurea and they are missing the enzyme necessary to 
degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body  For them it will 
accumulate in the body and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve
cells  Therefore it is Only a major problem in young children until around
age  or so or women who are pregnant and have this disorder  It used to
be a leading cause of brain damage in infants but now it can be easily 
detected at birth and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine
as a child or when pregnant  

heather

If I remember rightly PKU syndrome in infants is about   They lack
two genes And people who lack one gene are supposed to be  persons
Those with PKU have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine And those
who only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed to
be producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame 

The methol formaldahyde thing was supposed to occur with heating

I don't drink it I figure sugar was made for a reason To quickly and
easily satiate hungry people If you don't need the calories it's just as
easy to drink water  Used to drink a six pack a aday of aspartame soda Don't
even drink one coke a day when sugared

One problem is very few scientists are interested in alternative medicine

So Gordon why do you think this is so
 

Probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory
behind them  EG homoeopathy like cures like  The more you dilute
things the more powerful they get even if you dilute them so much
there is no ingredient but water left  Chiropractic all illness
stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae  Such
systems are so patently absurd that any good they do is accidental
and not related to the theory  The only exception is probably herbalism
because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants
and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants
that have active and useful substances  But that isn't what 
is meant by alternative medicine usually  If you get into the Qi
accupuntunce charts etc you are now back to silly theories that
probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases

Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience
Rhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal
and his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that 
people don't want to be associated with that sort of thing

Your medical school library should have books on peripheral nerve

How does the helium get consumed  I would have thought that failure
to contain it perfectly would result in its evaporation  back into 
the atmosphere  Sounds like a cycle to me  Obviously it takes 
energy to run the cycle but I seriously doubt that helium consumption
is a resource issue

It's not a cycle  Free helium will escape from the atmosphere due to
its high velocity  It won't be practical to recover it  It has
to be mined

This is in fact a hot topic in medicine these days and much of the
medical literature is devoted to this  The most heavily funded studies
these days are for outcome research and physicians and others are
constantly questionning whether what we do it truly effective in any given
situation  QA activities are a routine part of every hospital's
administrative function and are required by accreditation agencies  There
are even entire publications devoted to QA issues

  From a business point of view it might make sense  It depends on
  the personality of the practitioner  If he can charm the patients
  into coming homeopathy can be very profitable  It won't be covered
  by insurance however  Just keep that in mind  Myself I'd have 
 
 
 In many European countries Homepathy is accepted as a method of curing
 or at least alleiating many conditions to which modern medicine has 
 no answer In most of these countries insurance pays for the 
 treatments
 

 Accepted by whom  Not by scientists  There are people
 in every country who waste time and money on quackery
 In Britain and Scandanavia where I have worked it was not paid for
 What are most of these countries  I don't believe you

In Holland insurences pay for Homeopathic treatment In Germany they do
so as well I Austria they do if you have a condition which can not be 
helped by normal medicine happened to me Switzerland seems to be 
the same as Austria I have direct experience in the Swiss case

At the Univeristy of Vienna I believe Innsbruck as well homeopathy
can be taken in Med school

I found that in combination with Acupuncture it changed my life from
living hell to a condition which enables me to lead a relatively 
normal life I found that modern medicine was powerless to cure me
of a severe case of Neurodermitis Note I mean cure not 
surpress the symptoms which is what modern medicine attempts to 
do in the case of Neurodermitis 

I'm not saying that Homeopathy is scientific but that it can offer 
help in areas in which modern medicine is absolutely helpless

From reading your aritcle it seems that your have some deeply rooted
beliefs about this issue this is not intended to be offensive or 
sarcastic  it just sounded like that to me which makes me doubt 
if you can read this with an open mind If you docan please excuse

  of diseases is not the same thing as  of patients

   In a world with one curable disease that strikes  people and nine

 A disease would be counted among the  untreatable if nothing better than

Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than
sugar  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces 
when it degrades nutrasweet  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to
for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate 
substances  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde
produced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic to
living cells  All I can say is that I will not consume it  



   In the September  issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION
   LETTER there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners  What
   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet

   Reproduced without permission

	   The controversy over aspartame began six years ago in England
	where a group of researchers found that aspartame marketed under
	the tradename Nutrasweet appears to stimulate appetite and
	presumably the eating of more calories in the long run than if
	a person simply consumed sugar  When researchers asked a group
	of  people to drink plain water aspartamesweetened water and
	sugared water they said that overall they felt hungriest after
	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage
	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a
	good deal of concern among the artificialsweetenerusing public
	However its results were questionable at best since the researchers
	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did
	actually translate into an increase in eating  The two do not
	necessarily go hand in hand
	   In the years that followed more than a dozen studies examining
	the effect of aspartame on appetite  and eating  were conducted
	And after reviewing every one of them the director of the
	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins
	University Barbara Rolls PhD concluded that consuming aspartame
	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in
	the amount of food eaten afterward

	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing
	cancer is aspartame  But it most certainly has been blamed for a
	host of other ills  Since its introduction in  the government
	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing
	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety
	Still years of careful scientific study conducted both before and
	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm
	that it can bring about adverse health effects  That's why the
	Centers for Disease Control the government agency charged with
	monitoring public health the American Medical Association's
	Council on Scientific Affairs and the Food and Drug Administration
	have given aspartame one of the most studied food additives a
	clean bill of health
	   Granted the FDA has set forth an acceptable daily intake of
	 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight  To exceed
	the limit however a pound  kg woman would have to take
	in  milligrams of aspartame  the amount in  cans of
	aspartamesweetened soda pop  cups of gelatin  cups of yogurt
	or  sixounce servings of aspartamecontaining hot cocoa
	A pound  kg man would have to consume some  milligrams
	of the sweetener  the amount in  cans of soda pop or  cups
	of yogurt  to go over the limit  chart with aspartame content
	of selected foods omitted

I have a friend who has a very pronounced slouch of his upper back He
always walks and sits this way so I have concluded that he is
hunchback
Is this a genetic disorder or is it something that people can correct
ie is it just bad posture that can be changed with a bit of will
power

KS From keithactrixgennz Keith Stewart
KSMy wife has become interested through an acquaintance in PostPolio Syndrome
KSThis apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons  eg
KSchest complaints are treated separately Does anone have any information

I'm not sure that this condition is recognised anywhere in the
sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria clear boundaries
between it and other diseases unique pathologic or physiologic
features etc but here goes with what many neurologists agree on

Postpolio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease
by clinical examination EMG and muscle biopsy  The abnormalities
are mostly chronic due to old polio but there is evidence of
ongoing deterioration  Clinically the patients complain of
declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks
Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless
contributes to the impaired performance  The examination shows
muscle weakness and atrophy  The EMG shows evidence of old
denervation with reinnervation giant and longduration motor unit
action potentials and evidence of active denervation
fibrillation potentials  The biopsy also shows old denervation
with reinnervation fibertype grouping and evidence of active
denervation small angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme
staining  but curiously little or no group atrophy

Postpolio patients do not have ALS  In ALS there is clinically
evident deterioration from one month to the next  In postpolio
the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one
year to the next  Of course there are patients who had polio
before who develop genuine ALS but ALS is no more common among
polio survivors than among people who never had polio

The cause of postpolio syndrome is unknown  There is little
evidence that postpolio patients have active polio virus or
destructive immunologic response to virus antigen

There is no solid evidence that patients with postpolio have
anything different happening to the motor unit anterior horn cells
motor axons neuromuscular junctions and muscle fibers than
patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration
Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings  The reason
for these acute changes in a chronic disease old polio is
unknown  Possibly spinal motor neurons that have reinnervated huge
numbers of muscle fibers start shedding the load after several
years

There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish postpolio
syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny
deterioration  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe
polio  The PPS patients are much more likely to complain of pain
They also tend to score higher on depression scales of
neuropsychologic tests

My take on this I'm sure some will disagree  after recovery from
severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles tendons
ligaments bones and joints that leads to inflammatory andor
degenerative conditions affecting these structures  The increasing
pain superimposed on the chronic but unchanging weakness leads
to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL  I am
perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS
patient who was not limited in some way by pain  I do not believe
that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than
nonPPS patients ie those with old polio of similar severity but
without PPS complaints

DN From nyedacnsvaxuwecedu David Nye
DN Briefly this is a condition in which patients who have significant
DN residual weakness from childhood polio notice progression of the
DN weakness as they get older  One theory is that the remaining motor
DN neurons have to work harder and so die sooner

If this theory were true the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy
evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units it doesn't
Instead the biopsy shows scattered angulated atrophic fibers
This is more consistent with loadshedding by chronically overworked
motor neurons  the neurons survive at the expense of increasingly
denervated muscle

I don't know anything specifically but I have one further anecdote A
colleague of mine had a child with a serious congenital disease tuberous
sclerosis Along with mental retardation comes a serious seizure disorder
The parents noticed that one thing that would precipitate a seizure was
a meal with corn in it I have always wondered about the connection and
further about other dietary ingredients that might precipitate seizures
Other experiences would be interesting to hear about from netters

Subject Re Eugenics
Gordon Banks writes

Probably within  years a new type of eugenics will be possible 
Maybe even sooner  We are now mapping the human genome  We will 
then start to work on manipulation of that genome  Using genetic
engineering we will be able to insert whatever genes we want
No breeding no hybrids etc  The ethical question is should
we
 
Two past problems with eugenics have been 
 reducing the gene pool and 
 defining the status of the eugenized
 
Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted
genes later became transmissible to progeny Then they may be able to
crowd out garbage genes This may in the future become possible Even if
it does awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully
mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy
later Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa
and for diabetes in the Hopi promoted survival in some conditions We
don't really know what the future may hold for our environment The
reduced wilderness and diseasesurvival capacity of our relatively inbred
domesticated animals comes to mind Vulcanism nuclear winter ice age
meteor impact new microbiological threats famine global warming etc
etc are all conceivable Therefore having as many genes as possible
available is a good strategy for species survival 
 
Of course the status of genetically altered individuals would start out
as no different than anyone else's But if we could make
philosopherkings with great bodies and long lives would we or they
want to give them elevated status We could The Romans did it with their
kings without the benefits of such eugenics The race eventually
realized and dealt with the problems which that caused but for a while
it was a problem Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen
to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks But there is nothing
new under the sun We treated slaves the same way for millennia before
   
 
I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 
problems Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to
use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time That
hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet Many are the civilizations which
have died from inability to adapt to environmental change However also
many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own
power The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the
fates of others and have survived by making better choices when their
turns came
 
Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off
the face of the earth or cause endless suffering Nuclear power or global
warming or whatever could and may still do that too 
 
The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue I personally don't think
man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any
better than he did the for last few We as eugenists may make it an we
may not If we don't I hope there are reservoirs of garbage people out
in some backwater with otherwise long discarded garbage genes which will
pull us through 
 
I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same
Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his
lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has Some men have
and I believe all men may listen to and obey the still small voice of God
in their hearts This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue
needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices Peoples have
died out for many reasons The societies which failed to accept enough
input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed
themselves and often others in the process It is selfevident that the
ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit
to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes
thus far or else haven't had enough power for long enough 
 
In summary I would say that the question of whether to use this new
technology is really an ancient one And the answer in some ways hard in
some ways easy is the same ancient answer It isn't the power it is the
Spirit
 
Sorry for the long post Got carried away

    Russell Turpin writes
             
not imply that all their treatments are ineffective  It does
imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are
incapable of discovering which treatments are effective and
which are not

To start with no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible  So
there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a
given context  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely
and makes progress impossible  Expenditure of sufficiently large sums
of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this  On the other
hand with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which
eventually turn out to be false  There is a morass of studies
contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  You people call
THIS science   My opinion for what it's worth is that one sees both
these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology  

Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor
appropriate for a particular investigation  I don't believe it is 
ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science  


My second point though is that highly capable people can often make
extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using
methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards  I think this
is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach
their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific

Within mathematics I think there are several examples especially before
the twentieth century  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann who is
famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove  Later 
mathematicians did prove them of course  

I think that for a good scientist empirical investigation is often not
so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a 
matter of convincing other people  People have proposed lots of 
incompatible definitions of science here but I think the ability to 
objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an
essential element  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step 
of the scientific process but I think that if one is not moving toward 
that goal then one is not doing science

When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and
seems to be very successful at it I think that his judgements are also
worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further
investigation  

In article CByHDnewsHawaiiEdu I wrote 
 Namely is there really justification for the belief that
 science is a superior path to truth than nonscientific approaches  

Admittedly my question was not at all well posed  A considerable
amount of effort in a serious scholarly investigation such as I
suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately 
specific question to try and answer  

The science I was thinking of in my question is the actual science 
currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century  
I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use 
of reason and observation

One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether
in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced
practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies  

Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with
the study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell us if there 
is any existing research related to this question  


In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems 
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

                        diet omitted

 Ronwhat do YOU consider to be proper channelsthis sounds suspiciously
like a blood chemistryglucose tolerance and the likesuddenly chemistry 
exists You know perfectly well that this person can be saved needless trouble 
and expense with simple muscle testing and hair analysis to diagnoseno
CONFIRM any aberrant physiologybut then againmaybe that's what you meantby proper channels

 Were you able to understand Dick King's post that  of diseases is not thesame thing as  of patients which was a reply to your inability to critically
evaluate the statistic you cited from the New England Journal of Medicine Couldyou figure out what is implied by the remark Of course MDs are ethically bound to not knowingly dispense placebos

 Ronhave you ever thought about why you never post in mischealthalterna
tiveand insist instead upon insinuating your untrained nonmedical often 
delusional notions of health and disease into this forum I suspect from your
apparent anger toward MDs and heteropathic medicine that there may be an
underlying 'father problem'of course I can CONFIRM this by surrogate muscle
testing one of my patients while they ponder my theory to see if one of their  
previously weak 'indicator' muscles strengthensor do you have reservations
about my unique methods of diagnosis OhI forgot what you said in an earlier
postneither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs meet your or
anyone else's criteria of acceptance

My supervisor is looking for a image analysis software for
MS DOS We need something to measure lengths and areas on
micrographs Sometime in the future we may expand to do
some densitometry for gels etc We've found lots of ads and
info for the Jandel Scientific products SigmaScan and Java

But we have not been able to find any competing products We
would appreciate any comments on these products and

suggestions  comments on other products we should consider
Thanks

As promised below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager 
I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog  I am very pleased with 
the results  The catalog description is as follows

	The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager 
	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles  much like a
	professional shiatsu masseur  The powerful motor drives two
	counterrotating thumbs that move in oneinch orbits 
	releasing tension in the neck back legs and arms

	Pressure Point Massager    A   

To order or receive a catalog call  hours  days  or
fax at 


NOTE
When I ordered the massager the item number was different and the price
was  not   When I received it I glanced thru the newer catalog
enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one  I was  
QUITE annoyed to see a  difference in price  I called them about it
and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although it
looks and works exactly the same  He told me to go ahead and return the
first one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as a
reason for return  In fact since the newer ones might take a while to
ship from the factory I received this one in  days he told me I could 
use the one I already have until the new one arrives then return the old 
one  VERY reasonable people


I have longterm neck shoulder and back pain if I were a building I 
would be described as structurally unsound    I have stretches 
and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away  
If for whatever reason I do not exercise for a while illness not enough
time lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus 
more prone to further strain  Even with exercise I sometimes require 
physical therapy to get back on track which st requires a doctor visit 
to get the prescription for pt  

The tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headache
sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye  When my 
physical therapist has massaged my neck and the suboccipital muscles 
in particular the  knobby areas near the base of the skull the 
headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to 
while it is being massaged

I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing
someone would invent a machine that would massage NOT VIBRATE my 
neck and suboccipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in 
the past that I could use by myself  No doctor visit or inconvenient 
pt appts for a week later would be needed to use it  I could get up 
in the middle of the night and use it if necessary

I have been using it for about a week or so now and LOVE it  The base
unit is about a  x  rectangle about  high with handles on each
side and it plugs into an average outlet  The two metal thumbs are about 
 in diameter and protrude about  above the base  The thumbs 
are covered with a gray cloth that is nonremovable  They are located more 
toward one end rather than centered see figure below  They move in 
either clockwise or counterclockwise directions depending on which side 
of the switch is pushed and are very quiet  It can be used from either
side  For instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck
or the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it


                 
                            
                     		     
                                 
                                     
                     		     
                          
                 			    
                


For the neckhead the user varies the amount of pressure used by if 
laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head andor 
neck to rest on the thumbs  The handles can also be used if sitting or
standing applying pressure with the armswrists  Since my wrists are
also impaired I'm typing this over an extended period of time and I 
don't have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works 
well for me

For my back I sit in a highbacked kitchen chair position the massager
behind me at whatever point I want massaged and lean back lightly or
not so lightly against it  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place  
If I want to massage the entire spine I simply move it down a few inches 
whenever I feel like it  For my back this machine is far superior to use 
than the commonly used homemade massager of  tennis balls taped together 
with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and 
move the body up and down against them  The tennis balls are better than 
nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are 
not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if I don't 
pin it up first  As far as I'm concerned the easier something like this 
is to use the more likely I'll usedo it  If there are multiple 
considerationshassles I'm more likely to not bother with it

Not only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion 
for my neck and back are greatly increased  The first time I used it on my
necksuboccipital muscles however I overdid it and pressed too hard
against it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for a
few days  I laid off it for about  days and applied ice which helped  
After that I was more gradual about applying pressure  At this point 
the pain in the suboccipital area is now minimal while being massaged  
I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back which is the 
most vulnerable point for me

It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades
although again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at
a time to really work it out

I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although I
cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since I've had
it such a short time  I plan to use it not only to ease tension but also 
to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising and maybe after too  I have
been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this 
was very timely  for me

This is the st product I've ordered from this company and only recently
became aware of it thru a coworker  The catalog states they have been
in business since   It contains quite a few health care products and
while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog
products they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought
put into what they actually do  Definitely a step above some other ones
I've seen such as Dr Leonards Health Care Catalog or Mature Wisdom
I'm only  but have ended up on some geriatrictype mailing lists no
big surprise here    I consider many of those products to be ripoffs 
particularly targeted toward the elderly with dubious health benefits

I apologize for the length of this but it's the kind of info I would 
like to know before ordering something thru the mail

I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or 
even gets better because of hisher belief in the medicine and 
the doctor administering it  Is there also an antiplacebo 
effect where the patient dislikesdistrusts doctors and medicine 
and therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of the 
medicine

Is there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a 
medicine that heshe sees improvement where the is none or sees 
more improvement than there is  If so what is this effect 
called  Is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor 
doesn't believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than 
there is  What would this effect be called  Have these effects 
ever been studied  How common are these effects  Thank you in 
advance for all replies

Hi
I am not sure where to post this message please contact me if I'm way off
the mark
On  my wife went to her General Practitioner Doctor He mentioned
an article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us He had
read it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again
The article was about Whiplash InjuryCervical Pain It mentions the use of
a MRI Magnetic Resonance Imagery machine as a diagnostic tool and the work
of a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain
This article is most likely in an Australian medical journal I very much
want to obtain the name of the article journal and author because the case
matches my wife We would very much appreciate anyone's help in this matter
via email preferably

Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on AE  some  years
since I saw it last  

I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film
for handling infectious diseases and similar toxic substances
Clearly they faked a lot of the computer  robotic technology
certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction
itself let alone the idea of a space germ  

Quite coincidentally actually this is what got me wanted to see
the movie again I watched a segment on the otherwise awful How'd
They Do That dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's top
lab  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken
so that building will never be cracked so to speak by man or
nature short of deliberate bombing from the air perhaps  And
the researchers used spacesuits similar to that in the film

I'm curious what people think about this film  short of silly
Is such a facility technically feasible today  

As far as the plot and the crystalline structure that is not Life
As We Know It that's a whole 'nother argument for recartssftech
or something

From my reading of the popular and scientific literature  I think that the
benzopyrenefromburnedfat problem is probably real but very small compared to
other kinds of risks  This type of problem also occurs with stovetop pan
grilling  One possible remedy I have read about is to take some vitamin C with your meal of barbecue or bacon eg  This MAY make sense because vit C
is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the 
chemicals in question  Bon Apetit

     Following a series of miscarriages my wife was given a transfusion of
my white cells The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind
of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as
it normally would a foreign body Where this blocking is deficient the
body evicts the intruder resulting in a miscarriage The white cells
apparently enhance the blocking capability Following the transfusion she
successfully carried the next pregnancy to term and Jake is now an active
 monthold who cannot wait to walk
     We're now thinking about having another child but no one including
the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion really seems to know
whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive
pregnancies
     Is there anyone in netland who has experience with this
ThanksGene and Jane and Jake

Is there such a thing as MSG monosodium glutamate sensitivity
I saw in the NY Times Sunday that scientists have testified before
an FDA advisory panel that complaints about MSG sensitivity are
superstition Anybody here have experience to the contrary

I know that there is MSG sensitivity  When I eat foods with MSG I get
very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash I first
experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese
food almost everyday for lunch  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all  I can
notice immediately when I have eaten any  I try to avoid MSG completely

Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing
the exact same rash on their hands  I couldn't understand why because I
don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese I still
love it  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where
one of their favorite foods  One of the main ingredients in the flavor
packets is MSG  Now I look at all labels  You would be surprised at
places you find MSG

In article Aprcsrochesteredu fulkcsrochesteredu Mark Fulk writes

 I'm not familiar with the history of this experiment although arguably
 I should be

For a brief but pretty detailed account try Hempel's Philosophy of
Natural Science

 I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising
 That's not what I'd quibble about  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's
 reasons for doing his experiment not the post hoc constructed reasons
 but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem  It may be

This smacks a bit of ideology  the supposition being that Toricelli's
subsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical  It gets dangerously
close to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science if
we deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions
of their real reasons

 impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts that's too bad if
 it is so  One of RootBernstein's services to science is that he has gone
 rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's and other people's notes and has
 discovered some surprising clues about their motivations  Pasteur never
 publicly admitted his plan to create mirrorimage life but the dreams are
 right there in his notebooks finally public after many years ready for
 anyone to read  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous
 reasons for pursuing results one of my best came because I was mad at
 a colleague for a poorlywritten claim I disproved the claim
 
 Of course Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety where the
 fantasy not only motivates the experiment but turns out to be right
 in the end

But my point is that this type of case is not a rarity  In fact I was
going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example  particularly
the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation  I will readily
concede that ridiculous reasons can play an important role in how
scientists spend their time  But one should not confuse motivation with
methodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the
majority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence

My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our
first child due June th  We interviewed a young doctor last week
and were very impressed with her  However I discovered that she is
actually not an Medical Doctor MD but rather a Doctor of 
Osteopathy DO  What's the difference  I believe the pediatrician
I went to for many years was a DO and he didn't seem different from
any other doctor I've seen over the years

My dictionary says that osteopathy is a medical therapy that emphasizes
manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought
to cause disease and inhibit recovery

Jeez this sounds like chiropractic  I remember getting shots and
medicine from my pediatrician DO and don't remember any 
manipulative techniques  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to
the real practical difference between an MD and a DO  Also I'm
interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who
follows one or the other medical philosophy

In article cupportalcom mmmcupportalcom Mark Robert Thorson writes

This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw  Today he
smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot  He used a strange technique
I'd never seen before
 
He took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil
The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffeetable ash tray
made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges
 
In the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar
quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of two
teabags of Earl Grey tea and a few cloves
 
On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum baskettype steamer with
two chicken breasts in it  The lid was put on and the whole assembly
went on the stovetop at high heat for  or  minutes
 
Later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts  What surprises
and concerns me are
 
  No wood chips  Where does the smoke flavor come from
 
  About  or  years ago I remember hearing that carmel color
    obtained by caramelizing sugar  a common coloring and flavoring
    agent had been found to be carcinogenic  I believe they injected
    it under the skin of rats or something  If the results were conclusive
    caramel color would not be legal in the US yet it is still being
    used  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what
 
  About  or  years ago I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated
    as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract
    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit  Does anyone know whatever
    happened with that story  If it were carcinogenic Earl Grey tea
    could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do
    so
 
WRT natural wood smoke I've smoking a duck right now as it happens
I've noticed that a heavilysmoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy
taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently
stopped flowing  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips
getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process
then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips
 
My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are lowmolecular weight
stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort
of larger molecule more similar to tar  The long barbeque time after
the initial intensive smoke drives off the lowmolecular weight stuff
just leaving the flavor behind  Does anyone know if my theory is correct
 
I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping
on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic  For that reason and because
it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess I only grill
nondrippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals  I do stuff like this
duck by indirect heat  I have a long rectangular Weber and I put the coals
at one end and the meat at the other end  The fat drops directly on the
floor below the meat and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire
in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals
 
And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that
smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains
nitrosamines which are carcinogenic  I'm pretty sure this claim actually
has some standing don't know about the others
 
An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal when it was
discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting
a lot of ethylene dibromide EDB into the cake mix to suppress weevils
This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic
The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended
himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day
for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal
broiled steaks  What a great analogy  When I first heard that my
immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit  One charcoal
broiled steak would be equivalent to  Duncans

I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to
be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the US  I think that
naturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances are
pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additives
or other consumption  It's only when the chemists concoct sp an
ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations  Otherwise if they 
really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything
How in the world do you suppose it's legal to consume tobacco products
which probably SHOULD be banned

 ever been studied  How common are these effects  Thank you in 
 advance for all replies 

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
treatments  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by 
performing studies that are blind in various ways  Some of these
are

  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a 
     placebo or the test treatment ie whether they are in the
     control group or the test group

  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
     receive a placebo or the test treatment

  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
     receive a placebo or the test treatment

Obviously at the point at which the data is analyzed one has to 
differentiate the test group from the control group  But the analysis
is quasipublic the researcher describes it and presents the data on
which it is based so that others can verify it  

It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
animals such as mice there were many cases of skewed results because
those who performed the study did not blind themselves  It is not
considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
are though it is important that in all respects except the one tested
the control and test groups are treated alike

   I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity
   which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring
   from the diet  The theory  which was backed up by interesting anecdotal
   results  is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these
   chemicals than other people  I don't remember any connection being made
   with seizures but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an allnatural diet

   Yeah the Feingold Diet is a load of crap  Children diagnosed with ADD
   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
   social skills which in fact continue to decline  Of course the parents
   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
   children's development  So much for the value of interesting anecdotal
   results  People will believe anything if they want to

Thanks for all the interest in this problem of mine I don't think it
is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown
any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food
She has always been very calm and dare I say a neat smart kid

The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made
by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to
something in the coating or the cereals  Of the four of us in our
immediate family Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever running
nose itchy eyes etc but we have a lot of allergies in our family history
including some weird food allergies  nuts mushrooms 

Anyway our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the body
chemistry  But so far no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizures
either  Every day that goes by without one makes me heave a sigh of
relief  Thanks again

The FDA I believe  Rules say no blood or blood products donations
from anyone who has been in a malarial area for  years  I was a platelet
donor until my Thailand trip and my blood bank was very disappointed
to find out they couldn't use me for  years


When the secretary of state asked me if I wanted to donate my
organs I said no because I figured that no one would want them
given my history  Was I correct

Not necessarily  The same rules may not apply to organ donation
as to blood donation  In fact I'm sure they don't

I've been invited to spend a couple weeks this summer rafting down the

health risks in doing this

You'd have to purify the river water first  I'm not sure how practical
that is with the Mississippi  You'd better check with health agencies
along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river  If
it is just microorganisms those can be filtered or killed but you
may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals
Better be same than sorry  Obviously drinking the river without
processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites

rights do they actually have  Does it matter if they are
US citizens most are not  We have had good luck with FMGs
and bad luck  SOme of our very best residents have been FMGs
Also our very worst  As it turns out the worst FMGs are often

Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on AE  some  years
since I saw it last  

Wow the WWII channel did something notWWII

I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film
for handling infectious diseases and similar toxic substances
Clearly they faked a lot of the computer  robotic technology
certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction
itself let alone the idea of a space germ  

The graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie 
audiences who have not ability or patience with numbers  The book was more 
realistic in that respect  In all respects actually  The robotics are 
still out of range but not impossible

Quite coincidentally actually this is what got me wanted to see
the movie again I watched a segment on the otherwise awful How'd
They Do That dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's top
lab  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken
so that building will never be cracked so to speak by man or
nature short of deliberate bombing from the air perhaps  And
the researchers used spacesuits similar to that in the film

SF and Ive always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification is 
usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution  NASA's 
decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story 
disasters  I mean NASA scientists were often SF readers and 
sometimes writers and felt prewarned by their reading

I'm curious what people think about this film  short of silly
Is such a facility technically feasible today  

I think the film still holds up among the best of SF films but that isn't 
saying a whole lot

As far as the plot and the crystalline structure that is not Life
As We Know It that's a whole 'nother argument for recartssftech

A bit more than a year ago a hernia in my right groin was
discovered  It had produced a dull pain in that area  The hernia
was repaired using the least intrusive orthoscopic method and a
plug and patch

The doctor considered the procedure a success

A few months later the same pain returned  The doctor said that
he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair

Now the pain occurs more often  My GP couldn't identify any
specific problem  The surgen who performed the original procedure
now says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and he
said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time

My question to the net  Is there a nonintrusive method to
determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from
something else

Summary More in response to Lee Lady
Keywords science   errors   Turpin   NLP


I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a
definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly
and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly  My definition
is this Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids
mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous
work  Lee Lady writes

 I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some 
 of the activities that lead to really important science  namely
 thinking and informal exploration  are not recognized as
 scientific work  

Unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a
mistake they fall under my definition  I hope no one would
consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as
unscientific  

In article CnAsFMHnewsHawaiiEdu ladyuhunixuhccHawaiiEdu Lee Lady writes
 Seriously I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not in one respect  
 I still have a major problem though with your insistence that science 
 is mainly about avoiding mistakes 

Here is where I think we are talking at crosspurposes  It is not
clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be
taken as describing what science is mainly about  Consider
for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking
a backbone  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and
what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what
invertebrates are all about  One can read this definition and
still not know that  of all animal species are invertebrates
that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that
some invertebrate groups  such as insects and nematodes  are
ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc  In short knowing the
definition of invertebrates does not tell one what they are
mainly about

The misunderstanding here is my fault  I did not give sufficient
context for people to understand my proposed definition

 Okay so let's see if we agree on this FIRST of all there are degrees 
 of certainty  It might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully 
 controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the 
 extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain 
 treatment On the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even 
 if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that
 a treatment is useful 

 SECONDLY it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of 
 evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal  

I agree on both counts  As an example of the second it would only
take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians
that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls  

As to the first I do not think it is useful to talk about
absolute scientific truth  I think it is more useful to talk
about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the
kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have
proven faulty or reliable  The latter is obviously a matter of
degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the
relevance of different kinds of evidence  

One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as
psuedoscience is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion
regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim
the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the
historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence
are given more weight than others  It is perfectly alright to
speculate  I have read quite a few refereed papers that
speculated left and right  But the authors were careful to
identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence
was presently available for them and to describe how research
could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to
uncover its problems  Often what distinguishes whether a paper
of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the
author sets the context and paves the way for future work  It
is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail

 The folks over in scipsychology have a hundred and one excuses not to
 make this simple test  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study
 will be satisfactory  a study of the sort that NLP practitioners 
 many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill 
 afford to do  Most of them are also just plain not interested because 
 the whole idea seems frivolous  And since they're not part of the
 scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain 
 from scientific acceptance 

I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that 
deserving or not  garner a patina of kookiness  When
proponents of some practice see no value in more careful
investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many
researchers' minds  

This is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some
intersection between things that are worth investigating and
things that are advocated by those who seem careless or
unreasonable in their advocacy  On the other hand I can
understand why many scientists would just as soon select other
directions for research  As Gordon Banks has pointed out no one
wants to become this generation's Rhine

 One academic in scipsychology said that it would be completely 
 unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't 
 been described in a scientific journal 

I think this is absurd  

 Actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done 
 with favorable results but it's apparently not acceptable because
 it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal

I wonder why the results were not published  In my field
dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are
submitted to journals  Often the papers are accepted for
publication before the dissertation is finished  This certainly
eases one's defense

Finally I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either
on NLP or the discussion of it in scipsychology  I know little
about either and so have nothing to offer

There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill
That's the point after all

Why don't you just look it up in the Merk Or check out the medical dictionary
cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread



That's because these peerreviewed studies are not addressing
the effects of MSG in people they're looking at animal models
You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and
doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects
demonstrated in humans  Note that I wouldn't have any argument
with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro
duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its
use in humans  This is precisely NOT what you said

Among others see Olney's  Excitotoxic Food Aditives  Relevance of
Animal Studies to Human Safety  Neurobehav Toxicol Teratol
vol  

I'm sure PETA would love to hear your arguments

Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as well I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intraventricular  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally Some studies used IV and SC
Intraventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies
for obvious reasons You must not have read the peerreviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk

It most certainly is for neurotoxicology  You know studies of
glutamate involve more than food science

Whose talking about food science What is this comment supposed to
mean Neurotoxicology and Tratology Brain Research Nature
Progress in Brain Research all fine food science journals 

Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the
journals Have you done a thorough literature search

So point us to the studies in humans please  I'm familiar with
the literature and I've never seen any which relate at all to
Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons

Then you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to
Chinese Restaurant Syndrome in a few articles Why don't you point
us to some studies Maybe then this exchange could be productive

The point is exceeding the window Of course they're amino acids
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine

Well actually they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine it's a
essential amino acid  They just try to get as little as is healthy
without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites
in the blood

They're unable to metabolise it

Olney's research compared infant human diets Specifically the amount
of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods
vs typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least fourfold in a single meal of processed
foods Mother's milk was well below the effective dose

Goodness I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of
glutamatesupplemented foods  It's just that this projected safety
margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that
you can prove anything you like  We're talking prudent policy in
infant nutrition here yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom

Who said anything about 'received wisdom' There is no question that
orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all
neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median
eminence These areas are responsible for the production of
hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal
development of the vertabrate organism Humans are vertebrates Now
what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain
necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing
Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary
ANH and ME of that part of the brain that is responsible for
controlling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone 

How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this It's unethical to
sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doses
of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans  The food
industry knows this That's why the animal model is used in medicine
and psych  If you're talking about straight sensitivity it would be
useful to define the term  There are plenty of studies on
psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and
physiology

I suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivities
You and lateoccuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its
implication for adults me  Certainly
the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than
for the young but the additivity of Glu and Asp and their copious
and increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and their
hidden presence in HVP necessitates extreme caution Why would anyone
want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the
endocrine system in adults  The main point is blood levels
attained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC 

Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you
provide peerreviewed nonfoodindustryfunded citations to articles
disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever 

You mean asserting  You're being intellectually dishonest or just
plain confused because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily
have anything to do with each other  Olney's reports would argue a potential
for problems in human infants but that's not to say that this says anything
whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods nor does he provide any
studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious
reasons  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon
of the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome  It says nothing about the frequent
inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab

Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some
sensitivities Terry Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally
administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone
fluctutations in adults Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant
supression of rhythmic GH secretion and to induce rapid and transient
release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG GH is
responsible not only for control of growth during development but
also converts glycogen into glucose Could this be the cause of
headaches I don't know

dyerursamajorspdcccom 
Hmm com Why am I not surprised
 Dianne Murray   wcsbeauccscarletonca

Probably one of the dumber remarks you've made

If you had read Olney's review article especially the remarks I
already quoted in an earlier post you would know to what I was
alluding May I ask exactly for whom you do computer consulting

While in grad school I remember a biochemistry friend of mine working with
heat shock proteins Apparently burning protein will induce changes in he
DNA Whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestion
I don't know but I never eat burnt food because of this 

Also many woods contain toxins As they are burnt it would seem logical that
some may volatilise and get into the BBQed food Again I don't know if these
toxins antifungal and antiwoodeater compounds would survive the rather harsh
conditions of the stomach and intestine and then would they be able to cross
the intestinal mucosa

Maybe someone with more biochemical background than myself which is almost
anyone  can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins that
may be in the wood used to make charcoal and BBQ

There is an eyedness analogous to handedness but it has nothing to do
with refractive error  To see whether you are right or left eyed roll
up a sheet of paper into a tube and hold it up to either eye like a
telescope  The eye that you feel more comfortable putting it up to is
your dominant eye  Refractive error is often different in the two eyes
but has no correlation with handedness

This is patently absurd but whoever wishes to become a philosopher

What do you mean more comfortable putting it up to  That seems a bit
hard to evaluate  At least for me it is  

Stare straight Point with both hands together and clasp so that only the
pointer fingers are pointing straight forward to a a spot on the wall about
eight feet away  First stare at the spot with both eyes open  Now
close your left eye  Now open your left eye  Now close your right eye
now open your right eye

If the image jumped more when you closed your right eye you are right

If the image jumped more when you closed your left eye you are left eye

As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
question WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD I must assume
that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it
and not quit when they shoud be sated  To put it a different way she 
believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict  
Eat all the chips chow down on several packages of noodle soup  you get the
idea   IF she is right then the moral and ethical standards of the 
food chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed  Can MSG
be considered a conditioning substance not addictive but sort of habit
forming 

This brings up a side question of mine   I have noticed that cats my
children's and my parent's seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
food The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
brand  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference but some
sort of chemical training or addiction My questions for the net are
Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food  Is it allowed for pet
food to contain addictive or conditioning substances  Is MSG put in 
pet food


I speak for myself and not Motorola

 As a physician I almost never get sick usually when something horrendous
 is going around I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case
 When I do get really sick it is always something unusual
 
 This was not the situation when I was in medical school particularly on
 pediatrics Pediatrics for me was three solid
 months of illness and I had a temp of  when I took the final exam
 
 I think what happens is that during training and beyond we are constantly
 exposed to new things and we have the usual reactions to them so that later
 on when challenged with something it is more likely a reexposure for us
 so we deal with it well and get a mild illness 

This is also commonly seen in new teachers  The first few years they're
sick a lot but gradually seem to build up immunities to almost everything

I think some essential information must be missing here ie you must be
suffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression  There is
no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy
person  The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms and may
even help prevent the development of postherpetic neuralgia but I
certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason

To address your more general question IV therapy does provide higher and
more consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug  For treating a
serious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is
getting adequate drug levels

 I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to
 be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the US  I think that
 naturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances are
 pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additives
 or other consumption  It's only when the chemists concoct sp an
 ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations  Otherwise if they 
 really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything
 How in the world do you suppose it's legal to consume tobacco products
 which probably SHOULD be banned

No there is something called the Delany Amendment which makes carcinogenic
food additives illegal in any amount  This was passed by Congress in the
's before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increased
detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude

This is why things like cyclamates and Red  were banned  They are very
weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the Act they are
banned

This also applies to natural carcinogens  Some of you might remember a
time back in the 's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good
and never tasted so good again  That was the time when safrole was banned
This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves

If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someone
would do it in order to make money  The fact that no one does it indicates
that enforcement is still in effect

An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file'
This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves  This
is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural
form so maybe that's how they evade Delany  Or maybe a special exemption
was made to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats

I don't mean to be disrespectful to your concerns but it seems to me 
that you're getting all wound up in a nonissue  

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out msg is a naturally 
occurring substance in a lot if not most foods  When food 
manufacturers add it to a preparation they do so because it's a 
known flavor enhancer 

Your wife's theory that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite 
may well be true  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's 
added  People are largely for the most part in charge of their 
own appetites 

children's and my parent's seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet

You don't know much about cats do you 

Cats will Take Advantage of You  Resign yourself  you will never  
understand a cat  Their tastes are whimsical  

I also suspect though it's been a while since I've checked ingredients 
on commercial cat food that there are much more stringent requirements 
on pet food additives than human  

See the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence 
to look out after their own interests

Some expansion on Kirlian photography

From the credulous side Stanway Andrew Alternative Medicine A Guide
To Natural Therapies ISBN  New York Viking Penguin 
p p  A notoverly critical but still useful overview of 
alternative health therapies

  the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the
  s  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'
  their subjects they photographed them  They found that if an object
  was a good conductor such as a metal the picture showed only its
  surface while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner
  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque  They found
  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead
  and living objects  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones
  were subject to changes  The object's life activity was also visible in
  highly variable colour patterns

  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in
  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up
  seriously  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at
  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and
  others have been produced in Brazil Austria and Germany

  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's
  fingers notably around those of healers who are concentrating on
  healing someone  Normally blue and white rays emanate from the fingers
  but when a subject becomes angry or excited the aura turns red and
  spotty  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose
  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method  They argue that
  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person
  isn't actually ill but is about to be  They claim to be able to
  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase

  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is
  the phantom effect  During high frequency photography of a leaf from
  which a part had been cut the photograph gave a complete picture of the
  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly  This is extremely
  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'
  the legs of amputees as if they were still there  The important thing
  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern
  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon  or the field would
  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished  The energy grid
  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than
  the actual object itself

  

  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer
  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water


From the incredulous side MacRobert Alan Reality shopping a
consumer's guide to new age hokum Whole Earth Review Autumn 
vNON p  An excellent article providing commonsense guidelines for
evaluating paranormal claims and some of the author's favorite examples
of hokum

  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of
  study making grand discoveries in his basement  Many paranormal
  movements can be traced back to such people  Kirlian photography for
  instance  If you pump highvoltage electricity into anything it will
  emit glowing sparks common knowledge to electrical workers and
  hobbyists for a century  It took a lone basement crank to declare that
  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura  In fact Kirlian
  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O
  Pehek Harry J Kyler and David L Faust who reported their findings
  in the October   issue of Science  Their conclusion The
  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on
  the surface of the body and not to mysterious auras or even
  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state  Nevertheless
  television shows magazines and books many by famous
  parapsychologists continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of
  the unknown

DM No matter how much I eat it still seems realistic

Yeah I want to try one of those oz steaks cooked over applewood at
Wally's Wolf Lodge Inn in Coeur d'Alene  That seems quite
unrealisticunrealistically SMALL  And a few slabs of ribs from the East
Texas Smoker RIP again in Louisville is not at all unrealistic either  

What say we have a recfoodcooking dinner at the Moonlite BarBQue Inn in
Owensboro It's all you can eat including lamb ribs  mutton for about
  We could invite Julie Kangas as guest of honor and see if the
Moonlite's Very Hot Sauce is too hot for her  It IS too hot for me and I
don't say that very often  And she could bring ice cream with crushed
dried chiltepins for dessert  

And we could see if there IS such a thing as an unrealistically large
quantity of barbecuethe owner of the Moonlite estimates that the
Owensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in the
summer and forty thousand in the winterin a town of   or so  Two
pounds per person per week   Again sure sounds unrealistic to methats
just too meager to be healthy

 Kiran Now a twopound slab of ribs a day THAT's realistic

Frequently of late I have been reacting to something added to
restaurant foods  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts
to feel puffy like I have a cold and also at times the inside of my
mouth especially the tongue and lips also feel puffy

The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants
usually chinese the most notable cases  a cheap chinese fast food
chain a japanese steak house I had the steak and another chinese
fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of
what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice

I am under the impression that MSG enhances flavor by causing the
taste buds to swell  If this is correct I do not find it unreasonable
to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell

Also as the many of the occurances including two of the above
involved beef and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG this is
what I suspect as being the cause

I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals
showed it as being harmless as it would be very startling to hear a lab
rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny

Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are
totally harmless is welcome to email me with the results of any studied
they know of  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder
of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer which the
tobacco companies still deny

 DM

If I sound grumpy it's because I had beef with broccoli for lunch
today and now it hurts to swallow

I believe it is illegal for a residency to discriminate against FMGs

The picture will show energy patterns or spikes around the object
photographed and depending on what type of object it is the spikes or
energy patterns will vary One might extrapolate here and say that this
proves that every object within the universe as we know it has its
own energy signature
 
There turned out to be a very simple conventional explanation for the
phenomenon  I can't recall the details but I believe it had to do with
the object between the plates altering the field because of purely
mechanical properties like capacitance  The aura was caused by direct
exposure of the film from variations in field strength

We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on  
Nassau Street Saturday April th  pm to benefit the Recurrent  
Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation a nonprofit foundation established to  
encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis  Our  
three year old daughter suffers from this disease  Below is a press release  
that appeared in local newspapers  Hope you can join us


On Saturday April  as part of Communiversity in Princeton a local family  
will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  
awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis

Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  
characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx vocal cords and  
trachea  Caused by a virus the tumors grow block the air passages and would  
lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths   
Three year old Lindsay has undergone  operations thus far since her diagnosis  
last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  
lifetime  

Even though the disease is hardly a household word it has affected the lives  
of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  
Papillomatosis Foundation  a nonprofit foundation whose goals are to provide  
support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  
newsletter enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level and aid  
in the prevention cure and treatment

Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  
those viruses causing warts they feel a cure would be within reach if money  
were available for research  Because RRP is rare it not only gets scant  
attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure  Part of the RRP  
Foundation's mission is to change that 

Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale please call  
Marlene or Bill at   Monetary donations can be made at the  
Foundation's booth during Communiversity April th  to  pm in downtown  
Princeton or sent directly to

			The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation

It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system'
and like a space explorer boldly go where no man has gone before and
return with a prize cure Unfortunately too often the prize is limited
and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all
sufferers

This applies to both medical researchers and nonmedical individuals
Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use
does not make the next cureall What about the dozens of individuals
who have courageously participated in clinical trials Did they have any
guarentee of cures Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their
story all over the world

As a parting note wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for
Meniere's To the original poster  what about trying for a trial of
that It's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate
some of the discomfort And you'd be helping answer the question for
future sufferers

A bit more than a year ago a hernia in my right groin was
discovered  It had produced a dull pain in that area  The hernia
was repaired using the least intrusive orthoscopic method and a
plug and patch



I suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic



Now the pain occurs more often  My GP couldn't identify any
specific problem  The surgen who performed the original procedure
now says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and he
said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time

My question to the net  Is there a nonintrusive method to
determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from
something else


By far the still best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned
physical examination If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down 
into your scrotum or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by
increasing intraabdominal pressure
Sometimes is not that obvious The hernia is small and you can only 
detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal 
Whether you have a recurrent hernia or this is related to the previous
operation I can't tell you The person that examined you is in  the best
position to make that determination

Are there noninvasive ways of diagnosing a hernia Every now and then 
folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this But these are far
too expensive and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger

It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age in
fact lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field

It probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is
usually a superficial burn to avoid any deeper damage Limited tinea
pedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as
well as systemic medication ie tablets Finally a selfdiagnosis is
not always reliable lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungal
infection and requires very different treatment

 Is there a righteye dominance eyedness as there is an
 overall righthandedness in the population I mean do most
 people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the
 other If so what kinds of percentages can be attached to this
 
 There is eye dominance same as handedness and usually for the
 same side  It has nothing to do with refractive error however
 
 I recall readingseeing that former baseball star Chris Chambliss' hitting
 abilities were in part attributed to a combination of lefthandedness 
 righteye dominance
 
I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to
see whether cross dominant individuals those with a particular handedness
but who had dominance in the opposite eye were better hitters than
those with same side dominance of hand and eye  I was picked from
my softball class because I was cross dominant right hand left eye
which put me in a small minority and the grad student was trying to get
an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people  To
control the study she used a pitching machine  fast pitch  Since
I was used to slow pitch I didn't come close actually I think
I foul tipped a few to hitting the ball  If there were a lot of people
like me in her study ie those who can't hit fast pitch or are
not used to hitting off a machine  I would seriously question the
results of that study  I think there have been some studies of major
league players across a fairly large cross section of players to test
whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was better 
but I don't know the results  The woman who ran the study I was in
said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major
leaguers than across the general population  but I'm not sure
whether I'd believe her

 I love that it's short for 'orthopedic surgeon apparently but while I'm
 waiting the PT is treating me
 
 She's using hot packs ultrasound and lasers but there's no improvement
 yet In fact I almost suspect it's getting worse
 
 My real question is about the laser treatment I can't easily imagine what
 the physical effect that could have on a deep tissue problem Can anyone
 shed some light so to speak on the matter

If it works it's only due to the heat produced by the laser

Crullerian photography isn't educational except in a purely satiric

extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within

Through a unique iteration involving the thdimensional projection of
a torus through the semistochastic interactions of hot monomolecular

Chinese and many other Asians Japanese Koreans etc have used

extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth

And to add further fuel to the flame war I read about  years ago that
the natural MSG  extracted from the sources you mention above  does not
cause the reported aftereffects it's only that nasty artificial MSG 
extracted from coal tar or whatever  that causes Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome  I find this pretty hard to believe has anyone else heard it

I was under the possibly incorrect assumption that most of the MSG on
our foods was made from processing sugar beets Is this not true Are 
there other sources of MSG

I am one of those folx who react sometimes strongly to MSG However
I also react strongly to sodium chloride table salt in excess Each
causes different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat
and an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in my chest upper left quadrant

I believe it is illegal for a residency to discriminate against

Is that true  I know some that won't even interview FMGs
 
I think a case could be made that this is discriminatory
particularly
if an applicant had good board scores and recommendations but wasn't
offered an interview but I don't know if it has ever gone to court

FMGs who are not citizens are like all aliens in a difficult
situation Only citizens get to vote here so noncitizens are of
little or no interest to legislators Also the noncitizen may well
be in the middle of processing for resident alien status There is a
stron sense that rocking the boat eg suing a residency program
will delay the granting of that status perhaps for ever

I am under the impression that MSG enhances flavor by causing the
taste buds to swell

No that's not how it works

If this is correct I do not find it unreasonable
to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell

This may be through a different mechanism

Also as the many of the occurances including two of the above
involved beef and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG this is
what I suspect as being the cause

Tenderizing beef involves sprinking or marinading it in papain an enzyme
Meat tenderizer packets might contain papain and MSG and seasonings but
MSG doesn't act as a tenderizer

MSG is common in many food we eat including Chinese though some oriental
restaurants might put a tad too much in them  I've noticed that when I
go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants I will usually get
a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards  This happens to many
of my friends and relatives too  And heh we eat Chinese food all the
time at home  but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves

So when we put one and one together it can be safely assumed that
MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people

Stick with natural things  MSG doesn't do body any good and possibly
harms for that matter  So why bother with it  Taste food as it should
be tasted and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG

I recently heard of a mental disorder called Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder  What is it  What causes it  Could it be caused by a
nervous breakdown
 
Obesssive Compulsive Disorder not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive
Personality Disorder  is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by
either obsessions persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when
not entertained or compulsions repetitive ritualistic actions that
similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted  

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression  

Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved
one though not accompanied by anger or a religious person having 
recurrent blasphemous thoughts  Generally the individual attempts to ignore
or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities  
The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind rather
than being from an external source

Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing
or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a
source of the anxiety

In OCD the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the
individual take an hour or more per day and significantly impair their
daily routine and social relationships

Treatments include psychotherapy behavioral methods and sometimes
certain antidepressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating
obsessions and compulsions

The standard diagnostic code for OCD if you want to look it up in the
DSMIII manual of psychiatric diagnosis is

tomatoes

Anyway lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural
things peanuts onions tomatoes milk etc  Just because something
is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks

As for how foods taste  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it why shouldn't I use it  Saying I shouldn't use
it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer

People have long modified the taste of food by additives whether
they be chiles black pepper salt cream sauces etc  All of these
things cloud the flavor of the food  Why do we bother with them
How should food be tasted  Isn't it better left to the diner

	The reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to
 gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might
   have recently been effected by it  from being associated with
   it or actually having this disorder  and
 help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated
   with seizures over the internet

Recently I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured  hours
after birth He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston
and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition
This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in
learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with
hospitals proceduresetc

I don't want to go into a lot of detail but his condition was termed 
quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight
as a normal baby would He was put on the standard anticonvulsion drugs
and that did not seem to help out His MRI EKG catscans are all normal
but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity After many metabolic tests
body structure tests and infectionvirus tests the doctors still do not
know quite what type of siezures he is having although they do have alot
of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms  This is where
we stand right now

If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above
any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing
from you I am not trying to play doctor here but only trying to gather
information about it As I know now these particular types of disorders
are still not really well understood by the medical community and so I'm
going to see nowif somehow the internet can at least give me alittle
insight Thanks

Candida albicans can cause severe lifethreatening infections usually
in people who are otherwise quite ill  This is not however the sort
of illness that you are probably discussing

Systemic yeast syndrome where the body is allergic to
yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine  There
is a book The Yeast Connection which talks about this illness

There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists

There's a lot of evidence it just hasn't been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the diehard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used

For example Dr Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives
before any other treatment a systemic antifungal such as Nizoral to his
new patients IF they've been on braodspectrum antibiotics  or more times
in the last two years  He's kept a record of the results and for over 
 patients found that over  of his patients get significant relief
of allergicsinus symptoms  Of course this is only the beginning for his
program

In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic
symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' I agree it is a poorly 
written book  eg extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which
I never had before started in November  Within one week of full dosage
of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared  I can
now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes  I'm also
greatly improved in other areas as well

Of course I have allergy symptoms etc  I am especially allergic to
molds yeasts etc  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a
natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you
would have perceptible symptoms  Also yeast do produce toxins of various
sorts and again you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that
such toxins can cause problems in some people  In my case it was sinus
since that's the center of my allergic response  Of course the 
question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed I was
from over  years of antibiotics nutritionallydeficiencies because of the
stress of infections and allergies etc can develop excessive yeast
colonization somewhere in the body  It is a tough question to answer since
testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy  One almost has to
take an empirical approach to diagnosis  Fortunately Sporanox is relatively
safe unlike past antifungals still have to be careful however so there's
no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons

BTW some would say to try Nystatin  Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae
too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect  You'll find
a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time

In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep
medicine on the right road  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients  If anybody doctors included said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection' I cannot guarantee
their safety  For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned

 I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to
 be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the US  I think that

No there is something called the Delany Amendment which makes carcinogenic
food additives illegal in any amount  This was passed by Congress in the
's before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increased
detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude

This is why things like cyclamates and Red  were banned  They are very
weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the Act they are
banned

This also applies to natural carcinogens  Some of you might remember a
time back in the 's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good
and never tasted so good again  That was the time when safrole was banned
This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves

If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someone
would do it in order to make money  The fact that no one does it indicates
that enforcement is still in effect

An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file'
This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves  This
is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural
form so maybe that's how they evade Delany  Or maybe a special exemption
was made to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats
 
I think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to
commercially producesell food with carcinogenic substances it is not illegal
for people to do such to their own food smoking etc  Is this true

Headaches that seriously interfere with activities of daily living
affect about  of the population  Doesn't that sound like
something a primary care physician should know something about  I
tend to agree with HMO administrators  family physicians should
learn the basics of headache management

Absolutely  Unfortunately most of them have had  weeks of neurology
in medical school and  month maybe in their residency  Most
of that is done in the hospital where migraines rarely are seen
Where are they supposed to learn  Those who are diligent and
read do learn but most don't unfortunately

Sometimes I wonder what tensiontype headaches have to do with
neurology anyway

We are the only ones sometimes who have enough interest in headaches
to spend the time to get enough history to diagnose them  Too often
the primary care physician hears headache and loses interest in
anything but giving the patient analgesics and getting them out of
the office so they can get on to something more interesting


I am excepting migraine which is arguably neurologic  Headaches

I hope you meant inarguably

My wife's obgyn has an ultrasound machine in her office  When
the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat  weeks she used
the ultrasound to see if everything was ok  it was

On her next visit my wife asked another doctor in the office if
they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist
read the pictures  The doctor very vehemently insisted that they
were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT

My wife is concerned about this  She saw a TV show a couple months
back something like  or Dateline NBC etc where an expert
on fetal ultrasounds a radiologist was showing all the different
deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound

Should my wife be concerned  Should we take the pictures to a 
radiologist for a second opinion and if so where would we find
such an expert in Chicago  We don't really have any special medical
reason to be concerned but if a radiologist will be able to see
things the obgyn can't then I don't see why we shouldn't use one

Any thoughts

  Another folk remedy receives the blessing of medical study           
Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically    
reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida a yeast infection
  For the yearlong study researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical    
Center in New Hyde Park New York recruited  women who suffered from 
chronic yeast infections For the first  months the women each day ate
 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus For the second 
 months the women did not eat yogurt The researchers examined the    
women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection 
were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt   
  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm  
It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection The   
researchers concluded that the L acidophilus bacteria found in some    
brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus Streptococcus         
thermophilus and L bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  
in commercial yogurt production Neither one appears to exert a         
protective effect against Candida albicans however Women who want to  
try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     
acidophilus in its contents

I recently attended an allery seminar  Steroid Nasal sprays were

none of the Vancanese Beconase Nasalide Nasalcort or Nasalchrom work 
nor do any oral decongestants work  She replied that she saw an article on 
Vasomotor Rhinitis  That this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing 
other than the Afrin's and such would work  Which in my case is true

I want to find out as much as possible about this since I am going to see 
my allergist in May and want to be armed to the hilt with information 
since nothing he has done with me has helped me at all and I have had no

Subject Bates Method for Myopia

Does the Bates method work  I first heard about it in this newsgroup 
several years ago and I have just got hold of a book How to improve your
sight  simple daily drills in relaxation by Margaret D Corbett 
'Authorized instructor of the Bates method published in   It 
talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise  Has there been
any study on whether this method actually works  If it works is it by 
actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball or by increasing 
the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the 
toolong eyeball

Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation seems to me the most
logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process
ie shorten it somehow preferably nonsurgically  Has there been
any recent studies on this  Where can I find them  I know RK works by 
changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of 
eyeball but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the 
eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better Bates's 
idea right

Thanks for any information

There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists
There's a lot of evidence it just hasn't been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the diehard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used

Snort  Ah there go my sinuses again

For example Dr Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives

Oh wow  A classic textbook  Hey they laughed at Einstein too

before any other treatment a systemic antifungal such as Nizoral to his
new patients IF they've been on braodspectrum antibiotics  or more times
in the last two years  He's kept a record of the results and for over 
 patients found that over  of his patients get significant relief
of allergicsinus symptoms  Of course this is only the beginning for his
program

Yeah I'll bet  Tomorrow the world

Listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless

In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic
symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' I agree it is a poorly 
written book  eg extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which
I never had before started in November  Within one week of full dosage
of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared  I can
now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes  I'm also
greatly improved in other areas as well

I'm sure you are  You sound like the typical hysterichypochondriac who
responds to miracle cures

Of course I have allergy symptoms etc  I am especially allergic to
molds yeasts etc  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a
natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you
would have perceptible symptoms

Yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously
Snort

Also yeast do produce toxins of various
sorts and again you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that
such toxins can cause problems in some people

Yeah it sounds reasonable to me

Of course the 
question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed I was
from over  years of antibiotics nutritionallydeficiencies because of the
stress of infections and allergies etc

Oh really  What tests  Immunecompromised my ass
More like credulous malingerer  This is a psychiatric syndrome

can develop excessive yeast
colonization somewhere in the body  It is a tough question to answer since
testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy  One almost has to
take an empirical approach to diagnosis  Fortunately Sporanox is relatively
safe unlike past antifungals still have to be careful however so there's
no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons

You know it's a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused
in this way  It's ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic
The trouble is that it isn't toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks

BTW some would say to try Nystatin  Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae
too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect  You'll find
a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time

The only good thing about nystatin is that it's relatively cheap
and when taken orally nontoxic  But oral nystatin is without any
systemic effect so unless it were given IV it would be without
any effect on your sinuses  I wish these quacks would first use
IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you  That would solve
the yeast problem once and for all

In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep
medicine on the right road  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients  If anybody doctors included said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection' I cannot guarantee
their safety  For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned

Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating
your symptoms

Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket  I'd hate
to think my insurance premiums are going towards this

Disclaimer I'm a sufferer not a doctor

I'm not sure there's a really sharp distinction between allergic and
vasomotor rhinitis  Basically vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is
stuffy when it has no reason to be not even an identifiable allergy

Decongestants and steroid sprays work for vasomotor rhinitis  Also
I can get surprising relief from purely superficial measures such as
saline moisturizing spray and moisturizing gel

Hello  I am not sure if this is the right conference to ask this
question however Here I go  I am a commercial fisherman and I 
fell about  weeks ago down into the hold of the boat and broke or
cracked a rib and wrenched and bruised my back and left arm
  My question  I have been to a doctor and was told that it was 
best to do nothing and it would heal up with no long term effect and 
indeed I am about   better however the work I do is very 
hard and I am still not able to go back to work  The thing that worries me
is the movement or clunking I feel and hear back there when I move 
certain ways  I heard some one talking about the rib they broke 
years ago and that it still bothers them  any opinions
thanx and cheers

	Ask the practitioner whether he uses the presterilized disposable
needles or if he reuses needles sterilizing them between use  In the
former case there's no conceivable way to get AIDS from the needles  In
the latter case it's highly unlikely though many practitioners use the
disposable variety anyway

just looked up my nose with his little lightthe same one used for 
ears and prescribed Prednisone and Sulfatrim DS severe headaches 
and a rash resulted particularly after my week's worth of Prednisone

I have become involved in a project to further develop and

Computerized Tomography imaging  We will eventually have
to peddle this stuff somewhere and so as I move this thing
along I would like to know 

What is the current resolution of SPECT imaging  What kinds
of jobs is SPECT used for specifically  What kind of specific jobs
could I hope
that SPECT could be used for if its resolution improved
say to close to that of PET Positron Emission Tomography
And how much does a SPECT machine cost  How much does a single

If anyone knows the answer to any or all of these questions OR
where I could find that answer I would be very grateful indeed

I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific 
brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them Mind machines
consist of LED gogles head phones and a microprocessor that controls them
They strobe the closed eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing
LEDs I understand that these devices are experimental but they are available
I've heard claims that they can induce sleep and light trance states for
relaxation Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc
I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful
The few sources I've seen are biased they are selling the things and a
friend who has tried them claims that every home should have one So 
do these mind machines aka Light and Sound machines work can they induce
alpha theta andor delta waves in a person wearing them What research if
any has been done on them Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer
Or are they just another bit of quackery

I've recently listened to a tape by Dr Stanislaw Burzynski in which he 
claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti
cancer properties that he names antineoplastons  Burzynski says that his 
work has met with hostility in the United States despite the favorable 
responses of his subjects during clinical trials

What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr Burzynski's research  He 
paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an 
intolerant medical establishment but I have no basis from which to judge 
his claims  Two weeks ago however I read that the NIH's Department of 
Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski's 
work  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate a 
treatment that didn't seem promising

Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current 
status of his research would be appreciated

This is one of those sticky areas of medicine where battles frequently

feet of altitude  One of them especially is very polluted

Often I feel faint the first two or three days  I feel lightheaded and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sealevel  Also it is very
dry in these cities so I will tend to drink a lot of water and keep
away from dehydrating drinks such as those containing caffeine or alcohol

Thing is I still have symptoms  How can I ensure that my short trips there
no I don't usually have a week to acclimatize are as comfortable as possible
Is there something else that I could do

A long time ago possibly two years ago there was a discussion here about
altitude adjustment  Has anyone saved the messages

 I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway

 About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes
 under one of her arms After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement
 of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it Over the course of
 the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced
 the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain At this time her doctor 
 suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue

 While attending one of her therapy sessions while her arm was being 
 manipulated some damage occured nerve which caused the level of pain to permanently
 increase severly controlled by Tylenol s and some loss of use of the arm 
 palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement With great persistence on her part
 the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had
 been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm This was removed also but the
 pain in the arm has not decreased The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is 
 persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 
 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain She has tried acupuncture by this only provides
 minor reductions in pain and is only short term  

 My questions are 

     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what if anything was done to reduce the
     levels of pain

     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced

     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored


  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated
  
  
  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group

  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup
  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated

There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists
There's a lot of evidence it just hasn't been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the diehard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used

Snort  Ah there go my sinuses again

For example Dr Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives

Oh wow  A classic textbook  Hey they laughed at Einstein too

before any other treatment a systemic antifungal such as Nizoral to his
new patients IF they've been on braodspectrum antibiotics  or more times
in the last two years  He's kept a record of the results and for over 
 patients found that over  of his patients get significant relief
of allergicsinus symptoms  Of course this is only the beginning for his
program

Yeah I'll bet  Tomorrow the world

Listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless

In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic
symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' I agree it is a poorly 
written book  eg extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which
I never had before started in November  Within one week of full dosage
of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared  I can
now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes  I'm also
greatly improved in other areas as well

I'm sure you are  You sound like the typical hysterichypochondriac who
responds to miracle cures

Of course I have allergy symptoms etc  I am especially allergic to
molds yeasts etc  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a
natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you
would have perceptible symptoms

Yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously
Snort

Also yeast do produce toxins of various
sorts and again you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that
such toxins can cause problems in some people

Yeah it sounds reasonable to me

Of course the 
question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed I was
from over  years of antibiotics nutritionallydeficiencies because of the
stress of infections and allergies etc

Oh really  What tests  Immunecompromised my ass
More like credulous malingerer  This is a psychiatric syndrome

can develop excessive yeast
colonization somewhere in the body  It is a tough question to answer since
testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy  One almost has to
take an empirical approach to diagnosis  Fortunately Sporanox is relatively
safe unlike past antifungals still have to be careful however so there's
no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons

You know it's a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused
in this way  It's ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic
The trouble is that it isn't toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks

BTW some would say to try Nystatin  Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae
too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect  You'll find
a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time

The only good thing about nystatin is that it's relatively cheap
and when taken orally nontoxic  But oral nystatin is without any
systemic effect so unless it were given IV it would be without
any effect on your sinuses  I wish these quacks would first use
IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you  That would solve
the yeast problem once and for all

In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep
medicine on the right road  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients  If anybody doctors included said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection' I cannot guarantee
their safety  For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned

Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating
your symptoms

Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket  I'd hate
to think my insurance premiums are going towards this

Steve Dyer

Dyer you're rude Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour It's
often practiced in a disorganized manner Most early treatment of
nonlife threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal
evidence given by the patient It's an educated guess by a trained person
but it's still no more than a guess
It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those
people who don't respond

There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many
diseases now described aren't known Read a book on gastroenterology
sometime if you want to see a lot of them After scientific methods have
run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental
method they choose And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine
doesn't have all the answers

This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine Maybe it's a
miracle cure maybe it's valid How do you know  

You might argue with the reasoning the conclusions But your disparaging
attack is unwarranted Why don't you present an convincing argument for you
r beliefs instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack

Hismanal astemizole is most definitely linked to weight gain
It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect

The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so
greatly Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face Some
claim their heart skipped beats once in a while

Both of these symptoms are related  tachycardia Getting a flushed
face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular
pulse  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in
the blood since note sodium chloride monosodium glutamate Both are
sodium compounds Our bodies require sodium but like everything else
one can get too much of a good thing

Some reacted with headache 

Again this could be related to increased blood flow from increased
heart rate from the sodium in the MSG Distended crainial arteries
essentially One of many causes of headaches There is no discrepency
her necessarily


some stomach ache

Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related Again not
necessarily a discrepency More likely a related reaction Vomiting
occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has
eaten If a person can't digest the stuff entirely possible  the
list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long and lacks an
enzyme to break it down gastrointestinal distress stomach or belly
ache would be expected


 Some had watery eyes or running nose


These are respiratory reactions and are now considered to be similar
to vomitting They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious
compounds They are adaptiove responses Of course it is possible
some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the
symptoms But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets
can be additive synergystic subtractive etc etc It would be
necessary to know exactly what was in a dish and what else the person
was exposed to Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration
and heart rate are connected  Things in the body are far from
simplevery inetractive place the vertebrate body
 
 some
had itchy skin or rashes 

People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound It depends
upon what it is about the compound that pisses off their body
Pollen for example of some plants aggrivates breathing in many
people because when inhaled it sets of the immune system and an
histamine attack is launched The immune system goes overboard
causing the allergic person a lot of misery And someone with an
allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that
contain pollens Chamomile linden etc Drinking the substance can
perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it 

More serious accusations include respiration 
difficulty 

See above And don't think that heart rate changes and circulatory
problems are not serious They can be deadly

and brain damage 

The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system
controlling the release of gonadotropin the suprahormone controlling
the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol as well as somatostatin
and other steroids Testing for effective dose would be uh a wee bit unethical


Now here is a new one vomiting My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
suspect of any problem In this case it might be just food
poisoning 

Absolutely But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating 
say undetected shrimp or mushrooms to which many are allergic plus
too much alcohol and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home
plus let's say having contracted flu from one's sig other  days
before from drinking out of the same glass Could be all sorts of
things

But it might be the MSG 

if you heard things about MSG you may think it must be it

If noone else got sick its likely not food poisoning Probably
stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to


Anyway the human body's not a machine people vary widely in their
responses and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things

 then start to work on manipulation of that genome  Using genetic

We stand on the brink of new memeamplification technologies  Harmful

Is there such a thing as MSG monosodium glutamate sensitivity
Superstition Anybody here have experience to the contrary

 person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids are
too I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE FOOD INDUSTRY WANTS TO PUT MSG IN FOOD
 
Because it makes the food TASTE BETTER  Why does it put salt in food
Same reason

I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND

Obviously
 
Somebody in the industry GIVE ME SOME REASONS WHY

IS IT AN INDUSTRIAL BYPRODUCT THAT NEEDS GETTING GET RID OF
 
Of course not  Although I would think that a person like you would be a
big fan of such recycling if that were the case

IS IT TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT THE RECIPES ARE NOT VERY GOOD OR THE 
FOOD IS POOR QUALITY
 
On occasion that's probably the case but in general the idea is that MSG
improves the flavor of certain foods
 
DO SOME OF YOU GET A SADISTIC PLEASURE OUT OF MAKING SOME OF US SICK
 
No
 
DO THE TASTE TESTERS HAVE SOME DEFECT IN THEIR FLAVOR SENSORS MOUTH etc
  THAT MSG CORRECTS
 
No
 
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
 
Obviously
 
ALSO  Nitrosiamines sp
 
As I recall these are natural byproducts of heating up certain foods
They don't put it in there
 
 
have a number of criteria in choosing how to process food  They want to
make it taste good look good sell for a good price etc  The fact that they
use it tells me that THEY think that it contributes to those goals they are
interested in  One of those goals is NOT making people sick  Such a goal
woud quickly drive them out of business and for no benefit
 
I think
 outlaw the use of these substances without warning labels as
large as those on cig packages
 
Warning of what  In California there is a law requiring that ANYTHING which
contains a carcinogen be labeled  That includes every gasline pump most
foods and even money cleaning machines because Nickel is a mild carcinogen
The result is that now nobody pays any attention to ANY of the warnings
 
 Require  of comparable products on the market to be free of these
substances and state that they are free of MSG DYES NITROSIAMINES and
SULFITES on the package
 
Why  What if not  of people wanted to buy this ugly rotten notastasty
food  I guess it will just be wasted huh  How terribly efficient
 
 While at it outlaw yellow dye   For that matter why dye food
 
Because it makes food look better  I LIKE food that looks good
If vitamin companies want to do that it is fine but who are you to
tell THEM how to make vitamins  Who are you to tell ME whether I should
buy flavored vitamins for my kids who can't swallow the conventional ones
whole
 
KEEP FOOD FOOD  QUIT PUTTING IN JUNK
 
How do you define junk  Is putting salt in food bad  What about
Pepper  What about alcohol as a preservative  What about sealing jars
with wax  What about vinegar  You seem to think that chemicals are
somehow different than food  The fact is that all foods are  chemicals
You are just expressing an irrational prejudice against food processing

   appreciated
	   In case you don't know Krillean Photography to the best of my
   knowledge involves taking pictures of an most of the time organic
   object between charged plates The picture will show energy patterns
   or spikes around the object photographed and depending on what type
   of object it is the spikes or energy patterns will vary One might
   extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
   the universe as we know it has its own energy signature

There have been a number of scientific papers in peerreviewed journals
published about Kirlian photography in the early s  Sorry I can't be
more specific but it is a long time since I read them  They would describe
what is needed and how to set up the apparatus  

These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can
be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the
moisture in the object being photographed  It has nothing to do with the
energy signature of organic objects

I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school
I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by
first dunking them in water

I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home
medical tests currently legally available
I believe this trend of allowing tests at home where
feasible decreased medical costs by a factor of  or
more and allows the patient some time and privacy to
consider the best action from the results of such tests
In fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic
tests for serious diseases such as cancer heart disease
should be offered free to the American public
This could actually help to reduce national medical costs
since many would have an earlier opportunity to know
about and work toward recuperation or cure

fell about  weeks ago down into the hold of the boat and broke or

  My question  I have been to a doctor and was told that it was 
best to do nothing and it would heal up with no long term effect and 
indeed I am about   better however the work I do is very 
hard and I am still not able to go back to work  The thing that worries me
is the movement or clunking I feel and hear back there when I move 
certain ways  I heard some one talking about the rib they broke 
years ago and that it still bothers them  any opinions



Your doctor is right It is best to do nothing besides taking some pain
medication initially Some patients don't like this and expect or demand
to have something done In these cases some physicians will tape the 
patient put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest or prescribe
an elastic binder All this does is make it harder to breath but the
patient doesn't feel cheated because soemthing is being done about the
problem Either way the end results are the same

I live at sealevel and am calledupon to travel to highaltitude cities
quite frequently on business  The cities in question are at  to 
feet of altitude  One of them especially is very polluted

Mexico City Bogota La Paz

Often I feel faint the first two or three days  I feel lightheaded and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sealevel  Also it is very
dry in these cities so I will tend to drink a lot of water and keep
away from dehydrating drinks such as those containing caffeine or alcohol


Thing is I still have symptoms  How can I ensure that my short trips there
no I don't usually have a week to acclimatize are as comfortable as possible
Is there something else that I could do



An unconventional remedy that you might try for altitude sickness in the Andes is
chewing coca leaves or taking teas made from coca leaves You might notice that
many of the natives have wads in their mouths the tea can be obtained in S
American pharmacies This remedy alleviates some of the lightheadedness and
dizziness  but don't try to jog with it I've tried this when travelling and
hiking in Peru and Ecuador The amount of cocaine you would ingest are too minute
to cause any highs

Also it is a good idea to eat lightly and dress warm while adjusting to high altitudes

I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning  Just after
I completed my th set of deep squats  Today was my weight training
day and I was just beginning my routine  All of a sudden at the end of
the th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep  It was cold turned pale
and lost  of its strength  The weight I used for squats wasn't that
heavy I was working hard but not at  effort  I waited for a few 
minutes trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with
chest exercises flyes with lighter dumbells than I normally use  But
I dropped the left dumbell during the first set and experienced continued
arm weakness into the second  So I quit training and decided not to do my
usual hour on the ski machine either  I'll take it easy for the rest of
the day

My arm is still somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal 
my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb Color has returned to normal
and it is no longer cold 

Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through
my brain  I'm  vegetarian and pretty fit from my daily exercise
regimen  So that can't be it  Could a pinched nerve from the bar
cause these symptoms I hope

Has this happened to anyone else
Nothing like this has ever happened to me before  Does it come with age

Thanks

Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor

Last Saturday evening my  year old son cut his finger badly with a knife
I took him to a local Urgent and General Care clinic at  pm  The 
clinic was open till  pm  The receptionist went to the back and told the 
doctor that we were there and came back and told us the doctor would not 
see us because she had someplace to go at  and did not want to be delayed 
here  During the next few minutes in response to my questions with several 
trips to the back room the receptionist told me
	 the doctor was doing paperwork in the back
	 the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going
	  to the emergency room
	 the doctor would not even speak to me
	 she would not tell me the doctor's name or her own name
	 when asked who is in charge of the clinic she said I don't know

I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room but
I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to
be bothered  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room  I'm still 
trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a 
letter   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again

FYII just posted this on altpsychoactives as a response to
what the group is for


A note to the users of altpsychoactives

This group was originally a takeoff from scimed  The reason for
the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
drugssuch as antidepressentstricyclics Prozac Lithiumetc
antipsychoticsMelleralsp etc OCD drugsAnafranil etc and
so on and so forth  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate
into a psudo altdrugs atmosphere  That's to bad for most of the
serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have
left and gone back to scimed where you have to cypher through
hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data

It was also to discuss reallife experiences and side effects of
the above mentioned

Oh well I had unsubscribed to this group for some time and I decided
to check it today to see if anything had changednopesame old
nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for

I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it
being moderatedtoo bad

Oh well obviously no one really cares

Bill Claussen


Would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group

Duh

For the record I have had several outbreaks of thrush during the several 
past few years with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional 
deficiencies I had not taken any antobiotics 

Listen thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite
characteristics  If you have thrush you have thrush because you can
see the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it it generally
responds well if you're not otherwise immunocompromised  Noring's
analretentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses
is not even in the same category here nor are these walking neurasthenics
who are convinced they have candida from reading a quack book

My dentist who sees a fair amount of thrush recommended acidophilous
After I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis the outbreaks ceased
When I quit taking the acidophilous the outbreaks periodically resumed 
I resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then

So

I heard thirdhand not the best form of information that there was recently
published results of a study on MultiplePersonalityDisorder Syndrome
patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may
have a psychological trigger or basis  What I heard about this study was that
in one 'personality' a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs
of inhalant allergy scratch tests were used according to what I heard
while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms including
testing a full  on scratch tests for particular inhalants

If this is true it is truly fascinating

But I'd like to know if this study was ever done and if so what the study
really showed and where the study is published  Any help out there

Morphine or demerol is about the only effective way of stopping pain

Subject GETTING AIDS FROM ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES

   someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture
   needles

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who               
themselves has AIDSit is unlikely not impossible they will get AIDS         
from acupuncture needles Generally even if accidently inoculated the normal
immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant 
involved with acupuncture needle insertion 

Most acupuncturists use disposable needlesuse once and throw away They      
do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of 
diseases via this routeso it's good business to advertise disposable needlesused here These needles tend to be of a lower quality however 
being poorly manufactured and too sharp in my opinion They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles                                                                        
If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint that patient will get 
their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments      
The risk here for hepatitis HIV etc transmission is that I could mistakenly 
use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              
patientbut clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates 
this risk Better quality needles tend to slide past vessels and            
nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snagsand hematomasso I use them                        
Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknessesbut they are all 
solid when compared to their injectionstyle cousins In China herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into 
meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require 
the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine This meansthinkingtinythat a samll amount of tissue the diameter of the needle bore will be 
injected into the body as it would  be in a typical shot when the skin is 
puntured On the other hand when the solid 
acupuncture needle is inserted the skin tends to squeeze the needle 
from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that 
haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion tend to remain 
on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior 

Of course in TCMthe body's exterior is protected by the Wei Protective Qiso infection is unlikelyor in other wordsthere is a normal inflammatory 
and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture 
site


While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease 
transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion I would like to know for 
what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturistnot to know  if it would be harmful but to know if it would be helpful

This is one of those sticky areas of medicine where battles frequently
rage  With respect to your OB I suspect that she has been certified in
ultrasound diagnostics and is thus allowed to use it and bill for its
use  Many cardiologists also use ultrasound echocardiography and are
in fact considered by many to be the 'experts'  I am not sure where OBs
stand in this regard but I suspect that they are at least as good as the
radioligists flameretardant suit ready

If it were my wife I would insist that a radiologist be involved in the
process  Radiologist are intensively trained in the process of
interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that
other physicians aren't aware of  Would you want a radiologist to
deliver your baby  If you wouldn't then why would you want a OBGYN to
read your ultrasound study


In my opinion the process should involve a OBGYN and a radiologist

For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion    There
does  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem  My current
episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea  If  it's
bad  enough the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy  However my doctor
this time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  to
protect the area  Apparently the problem is not that common but I'd be curious
if anyone else out there has a similar problem perhaps to see if a cause can be
found

Often I feel faint the first two or three days  I feel lightheaded and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sealevel  Also it is very
dry in these cities so I will tend to drink a lot of water and keep
away from dehydrating drinks such as those containing caffeine or alcohol


Thing is I still have symptoms  How can I ensure that my short trips there

Is there something else that I could do

Go three days early  Preliminary acclimatization takes  days  It
takes weeks or months for full acclimatization  Could you be

There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists

There's a lot of evidence it just hasn't been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the diehard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used

No there's no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous

The evidence is identical to the sort of evidence that has been
used to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases
in the past

medicine on the right road  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients

I like the implication here  It must not be that the quacks making
millions off such diseases are biased  rather that those who
doubt their existence don't understand the real world  It seems
easy to picture a th centure snake oil salesman saying the same
thing

However I have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple
quack diseases rise and fall in popularity  Systemic yeast syndome
seems to be making a resurgence it had fallen off a few years ago
There will be new such diseases I'm sure with bestselling books
and expensive therapies

If anybody doctors included said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection' I cannot guarantee
their safety  For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned

Well this of course is convincing  I guess I'd better start diagnosing
any illnesses that people want so that I can keep my lips

Dyer you're rude Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour It's
often practiced in a disorganized manner Most early treatment of
nonlife threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal
evidence given by the patient It's an educated guess by a trained person
but it's still no more than a guess
It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those
people who don't respond

 Some recent postings remind me that I had read about risks 
 associated with the barbecuing of foods namely that carcinogens 
 are generated Is this a valid concern If so is it a function 
 of the smoke or the elevated temperatures Is it a function of 
 the cooking elements wood or charcoal vs lava rocks I wish 
 to know more Thanks 

	I've read mixed opinions on this  Singed meat can contain
carcinogens but unless you eat barbecued meat every meal you're
probably not at much risk  I think I will live life on the edge and
grill my food

	I've also read that using petroleum based charcoal starter can
put some unwanted toxins in your food or at least unwanted odor
I've been using egg carton cups dipped in paraffin for fire starters
and it actually lights faster and easier than lighter fluid  Several
people have told me that they have excellent results with a chimney
basically a steel cylinder with wholes punched in the side  I've been
meaning to get one of these but one hasn't presented itself while
I've been out shopping  You can make one from a coffee can but I buy
my coffee as whole beans in a bag so I haven't had a big enough can

little or no interest to legislators Also the noncitizen may well
be in the middle of processing for resident alien status There is a
stron sense that rocking the boat eg suing a residency program
will delay the granting of that status perhaps for ever


One should be aware that foreign doctors admitted for training
are ineligible to apply for resident alien status  In order
to get the green card they have to return to their country and
apply at the embassy there  Of course many somehow get around
this problem  Often it is by agreeing to practice in a town
with a need and then the congressman from that district tacks
a rider onto a bill saying Dr X will be allowed to have permanent
residency in the US  A lot of bills in congress have such riders
attached to them  Marrying a US citizen is the most common although
now they are even cracking down on that and trying to tell US
citizens they must follow their spouse back to the Phillipines or
whereever

What causes those little brown spots on older people's hands Are they
called liver spots because they're sort of livercolored or do they
indicate some actual liver dysfunction

 The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made
 by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to
 something in the coating or the cereals  Of the four of us in our
 immediate family Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever running
 nose itchy eyes etc but we have a lot of allergies in our family history
 including some weird food allergies  nuts mushrooms 
 

Many of these cereals are cornbased After your post I looked in the
literature and located two articles that implicated corn contains
tryptophan and seizures The idea is that corn in the diet might
potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder not cause it
Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based I'd be interested

My girlfriend just started taking Imitrex for her migraine headaches  Her
neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound
headaches due to daily doses of analgesics  She stopped taking all
analgesics and caffine as of last Thursday   The weekend was pretty
bad but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every  hours
 Her third injection of Imitrex during the worst of the withdrawl on
Friday and six hours after the first of the day left her very sick  Skin
was flushed sweating vomiting and had severe headache pain  It subsided
in an hour or so  Since then she has been taking Imitrex as needed to
control the pain  Immediately after taking it she has increased head pain
for ten minutes dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains  A friend
of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused
heart attacks in several people  Apparently the mild chest pains were
common in these other people prior to there attacks  Is this just rumor 
Has anyone else heard of these symptoms  My girlfriend also has Mitral
Valve Prolapse

Opinions are mine or others but definately not MDA's

lots of editing out of previuos posts

Here is another anecdotal story  I am a picky eater and never wanted to 
try chinese food however I finally tried some in order to please a
girl I was seeing at the time  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant
syndrome  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared  different
dishes  It didn't taste great but I decided it wasn't so bad  We went
home and went to bed early  I woke up at  AM and puked my guts outs
I threw up for so long that I'm not kidding I pulled a muscle in
my tongue  Dry heaves and everything  No one else got sick and I'm
not allergic to anything that I know of  

Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am 
physically threatened  The smell of the food makes me ill and that is
a psycholgical reaction  When I have been dragged in to suffer
through beef and broccoli without any sauces I insist on no MSG  
I haven't gotten sick yet

Funny about that my wife my girlfriend at the time used to get sick 
after eating certain foods at various Asian restaurants and never knew 
why  She'd go pale and sweaty and then vomit copiously  A couple of us 
ventured a connection with MSG and her response was MSG  What's that  
It also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and 
chips which I noticed later had MSG on the label  Don't know about 
double blinds but avoiding MSG has stopped her being sick at restaurants

I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning  Just after
I completed my th set of deep squats  Today was my weight training
day and I was just beginning my routine  All of a sudden at the end of
the th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep  It was cold turned pale
and lost  of its strength  The weight I used for squats wasn't that
heavy I was working hard but not at  effort  I waited for a few 
minutes trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with
chest exercises flyes with lighter dumbells than I normally use  But
I dropped the left dumbell during the first set and experienced continued
arm weakness into the second  So I quit training and decided not to do my
usual hour on the ski machine either  I'll take it easy for the rest of
the day

My arm is still somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal 
my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb Color has returned to normal
and it is no longer cold 

Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through
my brain  I'm  vegetarian and pretty fit from my daily exercise
regimen  So that can't be it  Could a pinched nerve from the bar
cause these symptoms I hope

It likely has nothing to do with chunks of plaque but it sounds like
you may have a neurovascular compromise to your arm and you need medical
attention before doing any more weight lifting

reacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same old
quackery over and over again

It true that current medical knowledge is limited but do you realize
just HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your  It's playing the
lottery at best

If the results you got were so clear and obvious would you mind
trying a little experiment to see if it is true It would be quite
simple Have sugar pills and have real pills  Take one set for one
week and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are
the real pills Then at the end of the  weeks compare the results
Let's say you're wife would know which are the real ones If what you
are experiencing is true there should be a marked difference between
each week

 be bothered  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room  I'm still 
 trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a 
 letter   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again
 

The people in charge already know what kind of 'care' they are 
providing and they don't give a rat's ass about your repeat business

You are much more likely to do some good writing to local newspapers
and broadcast news shows  If you do keep the letter short and to the point
so they don't discard it out of hand and emphasize exactly what you
are upset about

It's possible that the local health department can help you complain to 
someone official but really that 'clinic' exists for the sole purpose 
of generating walkin income through advertising and nothing you can do 
will change them  all you can hope for is to help someone else avoid them

I'm glad it sounds like your son did ok anyway

My opinion only of course

of Health CDH compared with  cases reported in  During

Editorial Note The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in  
may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more 
complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH 
surveillance staff during  The increases in confirmed gonorrhea 
cases at DMHC and in culturepositivity rates in three of four laboratories 
suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact 
However the stable culturepositivity rate in the nonprofit family planning 
laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the 
gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population 
     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in 
Colorado may be gang and drugrelated sexual behavior as implicated in a 
recent outbreak of drugresistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs 
 Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area 
coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires 
further assessment To examine the possible role of drug use  implicated 
previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis  
 the CDH STDAIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom 
gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs 
and gang affiliation 
     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the 
national health objective for the year   per  objective 
a  Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for 
gonorrhea and other STDs Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at 
greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts Moreover race
specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as 
socioeconomic status access to medical care and highrisk behaviors 
     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado 
interventions initiated by the CDH STDAIDS program include  targeting 
partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at 
increased risk eg yearold black females and yearold black 
males  implementing a media campaign eg public service radio

 years in  states  that participated in BRFSS  a populationbased 
randomdigitdialed telephone survey  and administered a standard Injury 
Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC Of these respondents  
 had a child aged less than  years in their household Each respondent 
was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for 
that child The two categories of child restraint and adult safetybelt use in 
this analysis were  consistent use ie always buckle up and  less than 
consistent use ie almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up 
Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state Software 
for Survey Data Analysis SUDAAN  was used to calculate point estimates 
and confidence intervals Statistically significant differences were defined 
by p values of less than  
     Each of the  states had some type of child restraint law Of these six 
Arizona Kentucky Maine Nebraska Rhode Island and West Virginia had no 
law requiring adults to use safety belts four Idaho Maryland Pennsylvania 
and Washington had a secondary enforcement mandatory safetybelt law ie a 
vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse 
of safety belts could be issued and one state New York had a primary 
enforcement mandatory safetybelt law ie vehicles could be stopped for a 
safetybelt law violation alone In nine states childpassenger protection

laws included all children aged less than  years but the other two states 
used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use 
The analysis in this report subgrouped states into  those having a law 
requiring adult safetybelt use law states and  those without such a law 
nolaw states 
     Overall  of children aged less than  years reportedly were not 
consistently restrained during automobile travel Both child restraint use and 
adult restraint use were significantly higher p less than  chisquare 
test in law states than in nolaw states  versus  and  versus 
 respectively 
     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to  
year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than 
consistent safetybelt use Figure  Adults with consistent use reported 
high rates of childoccupant restraint use regardless of the child's age 
range  for yearolds to  for yearolds In comparison for 
adults reporting less than consistent safetybelt use the rate of child
occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range  
for yearolds to  for yearolds When comparing children of 
consistent adult safetybelt users with children of less than consistent adult 
safetybelt users  confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age 
groups ie aged less than  and  year 
     Reported childoccupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded 
that in nolaw states regardless of age of child Table  In addition 
higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with 
increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated 
with increased adult safetybelt use  

Reported by National Center for Injury Prevention and Control National 
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion CDC 

Editorial Note The findings in this report are consistent with others 
indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely 
to employ occupant restraints for their children  Because these 
nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit 
other risktaking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater 
risk for motorvehicle injury  
     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with 
child restraint use in this report Accordingly occupantprotection programs 
should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment Because low 
educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such 
programs should be offered to adults through healthcare facilities that serve 
lowincome communities or through federal programs ie Head Start that are 
directed at parents with young children 
     Injuryprevention programs emphasize restraining young children In 
addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as

they become older Parents especially those with low educational attainment 
those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do 
not have mandatory safetybelt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety 
belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and 
safety belts Finally the increased use of restraints among children may 
increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers  
the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safetybelt use and the 
highest rate of fatal crashes

 SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES
                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC 
                        AREAS  UNITED STATES  

     ProblemCondition CDC and some states have developed surveillance 
systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects 
     Reporting Period Covered This report covers birth defects surveillance 
in metropolitan Atlanta Georgia and selected jurisdictions in California for 
the years  
     Description of System The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program 
and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population
based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods The 
prevalence estimates for  diagnostic categories were based on data for 
 for  births in California and  births in metropolitan 
Atlanta The prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race 
sex and maternal age by using Poisson regression 
     Results Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal 
alcohol syndrome hip dislocationdysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the 
kidneyureter and scoliosislordosis may be attributable to general 
diagnostic variability However differences in the prevalences of armhand 
limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy  Down syndrome are 
probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these 
defects are relatively easy to diagnose 
     Interpretation Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy 
termination may affect prevalences of trisomy  and spina bifida However 
the reason for differences in armhand reduction is unknown but may be 
related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene 
pool or random variation 
     Actions Taken Because of the similarities of these data bases several 
collaborative studies are being implemented In particular the differences in 
the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on 
the impact of prenatal diagnosis Authors Jane Schulman PhD Nancy

     ProblemCondition CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza 
virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually 
from October through May 
     Reporting Period Covered This report covers US influenza surveillance 
conducted from October  through May  
     Description of System Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices 
of  cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality  WHO 
collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza 
viruses weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and 
territorial epidemiologists and from  sentinel family practice physicians 
Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received 
throughout the year 
     Results During the  influenza season influenza AHN and B 
viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency 
overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted 
over the course of the season Throughout the season increases in the indices 
of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza AHN predominated were 
similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated Only  of 
identified viruses were influenza AHN but isolations of this subtype 
increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the 
 season During the  season outbreaks in nursing homes were 
reported in association with influenza B and AHN but not influenza 
AHN 
     Interpretation The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of 
influenza strains AHN and B during the  season emphasizes the 
importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since 
amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A 
     Actions Taken Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced 
throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make 
informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine CDC's annual 
surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates 
for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons

                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies

Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilizationembryo transfer IVF
ET baby in  a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been 
developed that include IVFET gamete intrafallopian tube transfer GIFT 
embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation Together 
these technologies are referred to as the hightech assisted reproductive 
technology ART procedures 

Ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease andor 
pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility 
management However when these fail it almost always is appropriate to 
proceed with one of the ART procedures 

Therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility 
service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and 
Infertility there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in 
ART procedures This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients 
in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the 
traditional therapies 

The following article on back describes the ART procedures available in our 
Center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the 
realistic expectations for their success Procedures included are 

o in vitro 
o fertilization  embryo transfer IVFET  gamete intrafallopian tube 
  transfer 
o GIFT  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation 
This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed 
towards improved success of these technologies

                           Future Areas of Research

In addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the 
management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist 
couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary 
disease 

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then 
subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA 
amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization 

There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by 
other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and 
hemophilia We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ 
hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome the identification of 
which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit 
sexlinked disorders 

The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that 
it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility 
of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth 
of affected children

               Applications Success Rates and Advances for the
                           Management of Infertility

The following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona 
Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility 

     In Vitro Fertilization  Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our 
Assisted Reproduction Program  This procedure involves retrieval of 
unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and 
the culture of resultant embryos for  or  days before they are transferred 
to the patient's uterus All cultures are maintained in an incubator under 
strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions Before being 
processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our 
andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer

assisted semen analyses To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to 
perform IVFET or indeed GIFT follicular development is typically 
stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing 
hormone GnRH Factrel lutrepulse andor GnRH analogues lupron Depo 
lupron synarel Occasionally however IVFET is accomplished with eggs 
obtained in nonstimulated cycles While some programs utilize laparoscopic 
egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia 
we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasoundguided retrieval in our 
Infertility Unit with the patient sedated  
     Couples who resort to IVFET exhibit such pathologies as tubal 
deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis andor mild forms of male 
factor infertility  According to the United States IVF Registry the overall 
success rate for IVFET nationwide has stabilized at about  percent per 
cycle Results from our program involving  patients who have undergone  
IVFET cycles reflect a comparable success rate 
     Nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is 
disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological 
factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies  Well 
recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous 
ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated IVFET cycle 
attempts However among these age is the single most significant determinant 
of conception Therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an 
Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of 
traditional therapies 
     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not 
been clearly delineated beyond recognition that  the number of eggs 
available for retrieval declines markedly with age  fertilization rates 
significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over  years 
and  provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is 
unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy Ongoing research in our 
Center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may 
be impacted by age We have determined that more than  percent of eggs that 
fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant 
proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age Currently 
the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor Our 
program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs 
of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy 

     GIFT  This hightech ART procedure is performed in the operating room 
usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to IVFET involves 
introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian 
tube an average of  eggstube Under these circumstances fertilization 
occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo IVF 
with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for 
transfer in a subsequent cycle This ART procedure is applied to cases in

which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such 
pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility 
andor idiopathic infertility    
     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for  through  
indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained 
with the IVFET technique range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is  to  
percent and for IVFET  to  percent In view of this fact one might 
expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVFET However in our 
program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while 
substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed benefit the 
patient These concerns are  the increased costs associated with performing 
a procedure in the operating room  the risks albeit minimal of undergoing 
general anesthesia and  the considerable benefits to be accrued from 
obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs 
and the developmental competency of resultant embryos 
     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial 
environment provided by the laboratory in the IVFET procedure Between 
January   and December   we have performed a total of  GIFT 
cycles with an overall success rate of  percent 
     Embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when 
embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from nontransferred IVF embryos 
This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for 
success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical 
issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos Therefore as stipulated 
by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs from 
both a practical and an ethical standpoint all Assisted Reproduction programs 
should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys 
     Gamete Micromanipulation  This ART procedure which is still very new 
is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but 
who have severe male factor infertility less than  million spermml in 
combination with fewer than  perccent motile sperm andor less than  
percent sperm with normal morphology We are currently developing the 
procedure of subzonal insertion SZI which entails injecting sperm under 
the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm 
through enzymatic digestion 
     Available data from SZI programs worldwide indicate that only  to  
percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy This statistic undoubtedly 
relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm 
Therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques 
for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation Such 
efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology 
offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to 
establish conception

NIH Plans to Begin AIDS Drug Trials at Earlier Stage Nature  Vol

     The National Institutes of Health has announced it will start  treating 
HIVpositive patients as soon as possible after  seroconversion resulting 
from recent findings that show HIV is  active in the body in large numbers 
much earlier than was  previously believed  Anthony Fauci director of the 
US  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID  said 
We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly 
can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will 
get around microbial resistance  He said any delay would signify questions 
over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds  Fauci who co
authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature rejects the  
argument by one of his coauthors Cecil Fox that the new  discovery 
indicates that  billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time 
and money because the trials were started  too long after the patients were 
infected and were ended too  quickly  John Tew of the Medical College of 
Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument 
for  early treatment of HIVinfected patients  AIDS activists  welcomed the 
new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand 
the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue  We've known about this 
for five years but we're  glad it is now in the public domain said Jesse 
Dobson of the  Californiabased Project Inform  But Peter Duesberg who  
believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the 
West said We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDSeven

Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal Washington Post 
 P A 

     The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected healthcare  
professionals to patients is minimal according to new research  published in 
today's Journal of the American Medical Association  JAMA  This finding 
supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of 
contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote  Three studies in the 
JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIVpositive 
surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus  The  studies 
were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire Maryland and 
Florida  Each study started with an  HIVpositive doctor or dentist and 
tested all patients willing to participate  The New Hampshire study found 
that none of the   patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  
HIVpositive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV  In Maryland  of  
patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital 
were found to be HIVnegative  Similarly  in Florida  of  dental

patients who all had been  treated by an HIVpositive general dentist were 
tested and found to be negative for HIV  The Florida researchers led by 
Gordon  M Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine said 
This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general 
dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal 
precautions are strictly observed   Related Story Philadelphia Inquirer

Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program AIDS 
Treatment News  No  P   Gilden Dave 

     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of 
Health has raised questions about the NIH's commitment to an  effort that uses 
unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods  The OAM is a small division of 
the NIH with its budget only at   million dollars compared to more than  
billion for the NIH as  a whole  In addition the money for available 
research grants is even smaller  About  to  total will be 
available this year for  or  grants  Kaiya Montaocean of the Center  for 
Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington DC says  the OAM is afraid 
to become involved in AIDS  They have to look successful and there is no 
easy answer in AIDS she said    There is also a common perception that the 
OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find nonthreatening 
such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture  When the OAM called for  an 
advisory committee conference of about  people last year  the AIDS 
community was largely missing from the meeting  In  addition activists' 
general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic 
will be ignored  Jon  Greenberg of ACTUPNew York said The OAM advisory 
panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience  It  
will take them several years to accept the nature of research   
Nevertheless  Dr Leanna Standish research director and AIDS  investigator 
at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle said Here is a 
wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research  It's only fair to give the 
Office time to gel but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much much 
more than  public relations 
   
Herpesvirus Decimates Immunecell Soldiers Science News  Vol  
No  P    Fackelmann Kathy A 

     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus
 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells  This attack 
causes the killer cells to malfunction  diminishing an important component in 
the immune system's fight  against diseases  Also the herpesvirus may be a 
factor in  immune diseases such as AIDS  In  Paolo Lusso's research  
found that herpesvirus attacks another white cell the CD  Tlymphocyte 
which is the primary target of HIV  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus can

kill natural killer cells   Scientists previously knew that the natural 
killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly  Lusso's  
research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural 
killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack  according to Anthony 
L Komaroff a researcher with Harvard  Medical School  Despite the testtube 
findings scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the 
body  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus produces the CD receptor  
molecule that provides access for HIV  CD Tlymphocytes express this surface 
receptor making them vulnerable to HIV's attack   Researchers concluded that 
herpesvirus cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV

AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village To the Editor Journal of the 
American Medical Association  Vol   No  P   Gellert 
George and Nordenberg Dale F 

     All healthcare workers are obligated and responsible for not  only 
ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health 
problems but also to be committed to related  policies write George Gellert 
and Dale F Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency Santa Ana 
Calif and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta Ga  
respectively  Dr Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care 
about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for 
the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS  It should 
be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence it 
is not  the only illness doing so  Diseases such as malaria and many  
respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic 
development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations  
Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have 
on many developing countries and the increased need for international 
assistance that will  result  Berkley also cites the lack of political 
aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade  But now there 
is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach 
to international health and development in general and  HIVAIDS in 
particular  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book Earth in the 
Balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable 
international development with programs to  promote literacy improve child 
survival and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the 
developing  world  If enacted this change in policy could drastically  
change the future of worldwide health

Medical Association  Vol   No  P   Berkley Seth 

     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible 
before the disease reaches an endemic state even at a  cost of diverting less 
attention to some other illnesses writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller 
Foundation in New York NY in  reply to a letter by Drs Gellert and 
Nordenberg  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS such as 
malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited  
economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention 
than they are getting Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is 
receiving too much attention  HIV  differs from other diseases in most 
developing countries because it is continuing to spread  For most endemic 
diseases the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another 
year  of about the same level of needless disease and death  But with  AIDS 
and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in  disease burden 
but financially is much greater  Interventions  in the early part of a 
rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly costeffective because each 
individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission  Berkley 
says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  
economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership  But he 
concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the 
United States for the AIDS  epidemic but even more so in developing countries 
with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  
has been the rule

        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIVInfected Children


The National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental 
HIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus HIV the virus that causes AIDS 

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in  
children recruited from at least  sites nationwide Volunteers must be HIV
infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease 

HHS Secretary Donna E Shalala said this initial study can be seen as a 
hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIVinfected 
children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS 

Anthony S Fauci MD director of the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research said the trial is 
the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay 
disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick  If these 
vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their 
therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates  children in 
the United States have HIV  By the end of the decade the World Health 
Organization projects  million children will be infected worldwide 

The study will enroll children ages  month to  years old  NIAID which 
funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network anticipates conducting the trial 
at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the 
ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development 

Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows 
that certain vaccines can boost existing HIVspecific immune responses and

stimulate new ones  It will be several years however before researchers 
know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease 

The results from the pediatric trial known as ACTG  will be examined 
closely for other reasons as well  This trial will provide the first insight 
into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines said 
Daniel Hoth MD director of NIAID's division of AIDS  We need this 
information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent 
HIV infection in children 

In the United States most HIVinfected children live in poor innercity 
areas and more than  percent are minorities mainly black or Hispanic 

Nearly all HIVinfected children acquire the virus from their mothers during 
pregnancy  or at birth  An infected mother in the United States has more than 
a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby  As growing 
numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection 
drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding 
increase in the numbers of infected children 

HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults  
The most recent information suggests that  percent of infants born with HIV 
develop a serious AIDSrelated infection by  to  years of age  These 
infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of 
childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms 
leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays 

At least half of the children in the trial will be  years of age or younger 
to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older 
participants  All volunteers must have welldocumented HIV infection but no 
symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen 
liver or spleen  They cannot have received any antiretroviral or immune
regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study 

Study chair John S Lambert MD of the University of Rochester Medical 
School and co chair Samuel Katz MD of Duke University School of 
Medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara MD medical 
officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS 

We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children 
for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or 
fevers for example than another said Dr McNamara  We'll also look at 
whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other 
significant laboratory or clinical effects   He emphasized that the small 
study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three

products 

The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from 
recombinant HIV proteins  These socalled subunit vaccines each genetically 
engineered to contain only a piece of the virus have so far proved well
tolerated in ongoing trials in HIVinfected adults 

One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc of Meriden Conn contains gpa 
protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteinsplus alum adjuvant  
Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine  Presently alum is 
the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug 
Administration 

Both of the other vaccinesone made by Genentech Inc of South San Francisco 
and the other by Biocine a joint venture of Chiron and CIBAGeigy in 
Emeryville Califcontain the major HIV surface protein gp plus 
adjuvant  The Genentech vaccine contains alum while the Biocine vaccine 
contains MF an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in 
other Phase I vaccine trials in adults 

A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in  
children  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the 
experimental vaccine and three children will be given adjuvant alone 
considered the placebo  Neither the health care workers nor the children will 
be told what they receive 

If the low dose is welltolerated controlled testing of a higher dose of the 
experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of  children will 
begin 

Each child will receive six immunizationsone every four weeks for six 
monthsand be followedup for  weeks after the last immunization

           NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE HIV CAN CAUSE DISEASE INDEPENDENTLY
              News from the National Institute of Dental Research

There is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease 
independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at 
the National Institues of Health 

They report that HIV itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling 
skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV  Although the 
HIV genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals' 
immunity the researchers found  This led them to conclude that the HIV 
itself caused the skin disease 

Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease 
without affecting the immune system said lead author Dr Jeffrey Kopp of the 
National Institute of Dental Research NIDR  Dr Kopp and his colleagues 
described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human 
Retroviruses 

Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult since most 
animals including mice cannot be infected by the virus  To bypass this 
problem scientists have developed HIVtransgenic mice which carry genes for 
HIV as well as their own genetic material 

NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse 
eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice  The resulting litters 
contained both normal and transgenic animals 

Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV 
genetic material in l  Those mice however became sick and died too soon 
after birth to study in depth  In the present study the scientists used an 
incomplete copy of HIV which allowed the animals to live longer 

Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wartlike tumors on their 
necks and backs  Other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin 
lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans  No 
skin lesions developed in their normal nontransgenic littermates 

Studies of tissue taken from the wartlike skin tumors showed that they were a 
type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma Although the papillomavirus can 
cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the 
animals 

Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the 
presence of a proteinproducing molecule made by the HIV genetic material  

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 
Volume   Number                                            April  

Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were turned 
on or active said Dr Kopp 

The scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the 
mice  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common 
infections  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune 
systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the 
skin lesions Dr Kopp said 

Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists 
exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light  The light increased HIV 
genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin  
Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the 
genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said  No 
lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light 

The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr Peter 
Dickie who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases 

Collaborating on the study with Dr Kopp were Mr Charles Wohlenberg Drs 
Nickolas Dorfman Joseph Bryant Abner Notkins and Paul Klotman all of NIDR 
Dr Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute and Dr James Rooney

                                 March  


     HHS Secretary Donna E Shalala today announced the first nationwide 
clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care 
professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV 
infection or AIDS 
     The tollfree National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a 
physician a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist It provides information on 
drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment methods  The service is 
funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of 
San Francisco General Hospital 
     Secretary Shalala said One goal of this project is to share expertise 
so patients get the best care  A second goal is to get more primary health 
care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS which reduces 
treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and 
community social support networks  Currently many providers refer patients 
with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience 
     Secretary Shalala said This clinical expertise should be especially 
helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in 
communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available 
     The telephone number for health care professionals is  and 
it is accessible from  am to  pm EST  am to  pm PST 
Monday through Friday  During these times consultants will try to answer 
questions immediately or within an hour  At other times physicians and 
health care providers can leave an electronic message and questions will be 
answered as quickly as possible 
     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question 
related to providing HIV care including the latest HIVAIDS drug treatment 
information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral 
literature searches and other information  The service is designed for health 
care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate 
sources of information or materials 
     When a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken 
by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse 
practitioner  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and 
inpatient primary care for people with HIVrelated diseases  The consultant 
asks for patientspecific information including CD cell count current 
medications sex age and the patient's HIV history 
     This national service has grown out of a month local effort that

Volume   Number                                            April  

responded to nearly  calls from health care providers in northern 
California  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health 
Professions through its Community Provider AIDS Training CPAT project and 
by the American Academy of Family Physicians 
     When providers expand their knowledge they also improve the quality of 
care they are able to provide to their patients said HRSA Administrator 
Robert G Harmon MD MPH  This project will be a great resource for 
health care professionals and the HIVAIDS patients they serve 
     This service has opened a new means of communication between health care 
professionals and experts on HIV care management said HRSA's associate 
administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources 
Development G Stephen Bowen MD MPH  Providers who treat people with 
HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs treatment 
methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS 
     HRSA is one of eight US Public Health Service agencies within HHS

 Hismanal astemizole is most definitely linked to weight gain
 It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect
 and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly
 doesn't cross the bloodbrain barrier and so tends not to cause
 drowsiness

It also gave me lots of problems with joint and muscle pain  Seemed to

I would like to continue to thank everyone who has sent in a donation for the 
Mednews OCRScanner Fund  We have reached our goal  A Hewlett Packard
Scanjet IIp was purchased this week

Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received

John Sorenson
Carol Sigelman
Carla Moore
Barbara Moose
Judith Schrier

Again thank you to all who gave

I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to 
review the product  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems  
It runs under Windows  and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett 
Packard Scanners  

When initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options 
 text  graphics  input source ie scanner fax file disk file  
automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image 

I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which 
parts of the document I would like scanned and in what order

Once an image is scanned you can bring up the PopUp image verification  The 
software gives you two errors at this point  Blue which are words that were 
converted reliability but do not match anything in the builtin dictionary  
Yellow shade which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted 
correctly at all  I have found that the software should give itself more 
credit  It is usually correct instead of wrong  If a word is shaded blue 
you can add it to your personal dictionary  The only problem is the personal 
dictionary will only handle about  words  I find this to be very limited 
considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary 

After a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word 
processor formats  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a

Overall a very impressive product  The only fault I could find is the 
limitations of the size of the user dictionary   specialized words is just 
too small

                                 Introduction

     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would 
soon be eliminated as a public health problem  infectious diseases remain 
the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in 
the United States Since the early s the US public health system has 
been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes eg 
Escherichia coli OH hepatitis C virus human immunodeficiency virus 
Legionnaires disease Lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome The incidences 
of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera 
malaria and tuberculosis TB have increased in many areas Furthermore 
control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug 
resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease 
salmonellosis shigellosis TB and staphylococcal infections  Emerging 
infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those 
in institutional settings eg hospitals and child day care centers and 
minority and underserved populations The substantial economic burden of 
emerging infections on the US healthcare system could be reduced by more 
effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs 
 
     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series Emerging Infectious 
Diseases Future articles will address these diseases as well as 
surveillance control and prevention efforts by healthcare providers and 
public health officials This first article updates the ongoing investigation 
of an outbreak of E coli OH in the western United States

     From November   through February   more than  
laboratoryconfirmed infections with E coli OH and four associated 
deaths occurred in four states  Washington Idaho California and Nevada 
This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation  that 
identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from 
one restaurant chain Washington 
     On January   a physician reported to the Washington Department of 
Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS and an 
increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea During January  a 
casecontrol study comparing  of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or 
postdiarrheal HUS identified with age and neighborhoodmatched controls

matched odds ratio ORundefined lower confidence limit On January 
 a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants 
was initiated 
     As a result of publicity and casefinding efforts during January
February   patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the 
state health department A total of  persons had illnesses meeting the case

confirmed E coli OH infection during the week preceding onset of 
symptoms Of the remaining  persons   reported eating in a chain A 
restaurant during the  days preceding onset of symptoms Of the  patients 
who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant   reported eating 
a regularsized hamburger patty Onsets of illness peaked from January  
through January  Of the  casepatients   were hospitalized  
developed HUS and three died The median age of patients was  years

     Following the outbreak report from Washington the Division of Health 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare identified  persons with culture

  through February   Figure A Four persons were 
hospitalized one developed HUS During the week preceding illness onset  
 had eaten at a chain A restaurant California 
     In late December the San Diego County Department of Health Services was 
notified of a child with E coli OH infection who subsequently died 
Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with 
E coli OH infections or HUS from midNovember through midJanuary  
Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and

reported reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall  
increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December  and January 
 compared with the same period  year earlier A case was defined as

Chain B was not statistically associated with illness Nevada 
     On January  after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten 
at a local chain A restaurant the Clark County Las Vegas Health District 
issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea 
contact the health department A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS bloody 
diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured or any diarrheal illness 
with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E coli OH with 
onset from December   through February   Because local 
laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey SMAC medium to screen stools 
for E coli OH this organism was not identified in any patient After 
SMAC medium was distributed the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of 
one patient  days after illness onset

 Other Investigation Findings 
     During the outbreak chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases 
primarily were serving regularsized hamburger patties produced on November 
  some of the same meat was used in jumbo patties produced on 
November   The outbreak strain of E coli OH was isolated from  
lots of patties produced on those two dates these lots had been distributed 
to restaurants in all states where illness occurred Approximately  
 of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall 
     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the 
United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the

contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing 
the likelihood of contamination The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter 
plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states No one 
slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source 
     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in 
families and child day care settings is ongoing

Editorial Note E coli OH is a pathogenic gramnegative bacterium first 
identified as a cause of illness in  during an outbreak of severe bloody 
diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers  This pathogen has since 
emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS the most common 
cause of acute renal failure in children Outbreak investigations have linked 
most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other 
food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been 
implicated  Preliminary data from a CDC year nationwide multicenter 
study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E coli OH 
that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of  
participating hospitals and was isolated from  of all bloody stools a 
higher rate than for any other pathogen 
     Infection with E coli OH often is not recognized because most 
clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on

SMAC medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses 
associated with infection  The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea 
often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent Younger age groups 
and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and 
complications Illness usually resolves after  days but  of patients 
develop HUS which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia 
renal failure and a death rate of  
     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community 
outbreaks of E coli OH in the absence of routine surveillance Despite 
the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in 
three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington 
 Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from 
persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E coli OH using SMAC agar  
When infections with E coli OH are identified they should be reported 
to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public 
health action to prevent further cases 
     E coli OH lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can 
contaminate meat during slaughter CDC is collaborating with the US 
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify 
critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce 
the likelihood of pathogens such as E coli OH entering the meat supply 
Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with 
pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens 
from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be 
internally contaminated The optimal food protection practice is to cook 
ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices 
are clear In this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played 
an important role The Food and Drug Administration FDA has issued interim 
recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 
 F  C FDA personal communication  
     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report 
and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be 
consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of 
outbreaks The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of 
this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections 
caused by E coli OH and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E 
coli OH

     Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the 
United States almost tripled from  through   Longterm use of 
smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of 
oral cancer   the incidence of which could increase if young persons who 
currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently  
To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products 
CDC's  National Health Interview SurveyHealth Promotion and Disease 
Prevention supplement NHISHPDP collected information on snuff and chewing 
tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the US civilian 
noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to  years This 
report summarizes findings from this survey 
     The  NHISHPDP supplement asked Have you used snuff at least  
times in your entire life and Do you use snuff now Similar questions were 
asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking Current users of 
smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco 
use at least  times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the 
time of the interview former users were defined as those who reported having 
used snuff or chewing tobacco at least  times and not using either at the 
time of the interview Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and 
former users Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at 
least  cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as 
those who reported having smoked at least  cigarettes and who were not 
smoking now Ever smokers included current and former smokers Data on 
smokeless tobacco use were available for  persons aged greater than or 
equal to  years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide 
national estimates Confidence intervals CIs were calculated by using 
standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis SUDAAN 
 
     In  an estimated  million  US adults were current users 
of smokeless tobacco including  million  men and   
women For all categories of comparison the prevalence of smokeless tobacco 
use was substantially higher among men For men the prevalence of use was 
highest among those aged  years Table  for women the prevalence was 
highest among those aged greater than or equal to  years The prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American IndiansAlaskan 
Natives and whites the prevalence among women was highest among American 
IndiansAlaskan Natives and blacks Among both men and women prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education Prevalence was 
substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in 
rural areas Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among

Editorial Note The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless 
tobacco was highest among young males Adolescent and young adult males in 
particular are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that 
link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility Use of oral 
snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this 
behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for 
nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders  
     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among 
racialethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels 
and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require 
further explanation For example targeted marketing practices may play a role 
in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the 
differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons  
     In this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current 
smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes In the  NHISHPDP the 
prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco 
users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users In a previous 
study among college students  of current smokeless tobacco users smoked

occasionally  In addition approximately  of adults who formerly smoked 
reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to 
stop smoking  Healthcare providers should recognize the potential health 
implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use 
     The national health objectives for the year  have established special 
population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless 
tobacco use including males aged  years to no more than  by the year 
 objective  and American IndianAlaskan Native youth to no more 
than  by the year  objective a  Strategies to lower the 
prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless 
tobacco use integrating smoking and smokeless tobaccocontrol efforts 
enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco making excise taxes 
commensurate with those on cigarettes encouraging healthcare providers to 
routinely provide cessation advice and followup providing schoolbased 
prevention and cessation interventions and adopting policies that prohibit 
tobacco use on school property and at schoolsponsored events

                    LOW LEVELS OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES LINKED
                           TO SERIOUS ASTHMA ATTACKS
                           American Lung Association 

     A new study published by the American Lung Association has shown that 
surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with 
asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment  
     The Seattlebased study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits 
for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution  
The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed 
unsafe under federal air quality laws  
     People with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to 
exacerbate that inflammation said Joel Schwartz PhD of the Environmental 
Protection Agency who was the lead author of the study  When people are on 
the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over 
the edge 
     The Seattle Study correlated  months of asthma emergency room visits 
with daily levels of PM or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 
of  microns or less  These finer particles are considered hazardous because 
they are small enough penetrate into the lung  Cities are considered out of 
compliance with clean air laws if the hour average concentration of PM 
exceeds  micrograms per cubic millimeter of air  
     In Seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at 
levels as low as  micrograms  The authors concluded that for every  
microgram increase in the fourday average of PM the odds of someone with 
asthma needing emergency treatment increased by  percent  
     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory 
Disease an official journal of the American Thoracic Society the Lung 
Association's medical section  
     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that 
particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat  A  study 
by Dr Schwartz and Douglas Dockery PhD of Harvard found that particles 
may be causing roughly  premature deaths each year in the United States  
Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms 
and bronchitis in children  
     Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone 
says Dr Schwartz  But more and more research is showing that particles are 
bad actors as well      One problem in setting standards for particulate 
air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study  Unlike other regulated 
pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex 
and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and

acid aerosols  
     Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects 
of particulate air pollution says Dr Schwartz  We have no way of 
duplicating the typical urban mix of particles   Consequently most of what 
is known about particulates has been learned through populationbased research 
like the Seattle study  
     Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur 
dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM standard any

               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma

The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in 
dermatology pathology epidemiology public education surveillance 
techniques and potential new technologies as well as other health care 
professionals and the public to address  the clinical and histological 
characteristics of early melanoma  the appropriate diagnosis management 
and followup of patients with early melanoma  the role of dysplastic nevi 
and their significance and  the role of education and screening in 
preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality  Following  days of 
presentations by experts and discussion by the audience a consensus panel 
weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement 
 
Among their findings the panel recommended that  melanoma in situ is a 
distinct entity effectively treated surgically with  centimeter margins 
 thin invasive melanoma less than  millimeter thick has the potential 
for longterm survival in more than  percent of patients after surgical 
excision with a  centimeter margin  elective lymph node dissections and 
extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma  
patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high 
risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely 
 some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for 
melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs and  education 
and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality 
from melanoma 
 
A copy of the full text of the consensus panel's statement is available by 
calling the NIH Office of Medical Applications of Research at

                         NCIDesignated Cancer Centers

The Cancer Centers Program is comprised of  NCIdesignated Cancer Centers 
actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer 
incidence morbidity and mortality  Within the program there are four types 
of cancer centers  basic science cancer centers  which engage primarily 
in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers  which focus on 
clinical research comprehensive cancer centers  which emphasize a 
multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community 
outreach and consortium cancer centers  which specialize in cancer 
prevention and control research 
 
Although some cancer centers existed in the late s and the s it was 
the National Cancer Act of  that authorized the establishment of  new 
cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones  The passage 
of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened 
the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and 
cancer control research  Over the next two decades the centers' program grew 
progressively 
 
In  there were  comprehensive cancer centers in the nation Today 
there are  of these institutions all of which meet specific NCI criteria 
for comprehensive status 
 
To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center an 
institution must pass rigorous peer review  Under guidelines newly 
established in  the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the 
requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in 
several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong 
program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings 
into clinical practice 
 
Moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly 
beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant also 
referred to as a P or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting 
the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations  These criteria encompass 
strong participation in NCIdesignated highpriority clinical trials 
significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important 
outreach and educational activitiesall of which are funded by a variety of 
sources 
 
The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and 
capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit 
important new findings or address timely research questions

Of the  NCIdesignated Cancer Centers  are of the basic science type  
These centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers 
engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators 
and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications 
from new discoveries in the laboratory 
 
Clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and 
clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently 
incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their 
overall research programs  There are  such centers today 
 
Finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely 
structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and 
control research  These centers interface with state and local public health 
departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention 
and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions 
responsible for implementing populationwide public health programs  
Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with 
institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community 
hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials 
 
Together the  NCIDesignated Cancer Centers continue to work toward 
creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through 
interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from the 
laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice

NIH Set to Test Multiple AIDS Vaccines Reuters   Frank 
Jacqueline 

     WashingtonThe Clinton administration will permit the National  
Institutes of Health to test multiple AIDS vaccines instead of  only allowing 
the Army to test a single vaccine administration  sources said Thursday  The 
decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to 
test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc and the National Institutes of 
Health which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested  Health and  
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the 
therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday  Companies 
including Genentech Inc Chiron Corp and  Immuno AG have already told NIH 
that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests  The testing is 
intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  
replication of HIV in patients already infected  Shalala refuted last week's 
reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the 
MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time  
The report was inaccurate  and I expect there to be some announcement in the 
next  hours  about that particular AIDS research project said Shalala   
Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr Bernadine 
Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had 
convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested 
simultaneously  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of 
multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two 
years

The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV US News  World Report  Vol 
 No  P  

     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in    Burroughs Wellcome 
the manufacturer of AZT made  million  last year alone from sales of the 
drug  However a team of  European researchers recently reported that 
although HIVpositive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk 
of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment that benefit  
disappeared two years later  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of 
the threeyear study which could give more reason  for critics to argue the 
drug's cost side effects and general  efficacy  Even though US 
researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials 
many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIVpositive patients 
experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  
AIDS symptoms  In addition researchers have long been familiar  with the 
 end of part

GB I am excepting migraine which is arguably neurologic
GB I hope you meant inarguably

Given the choice I would rather argue g

No arguments about migranous aura in fact current best evidence is
that aura is intrinsicially neuronal a la spreading depression of
Leao rather than vascular something causing vasoconstriction and
secondary neuronal ischemia

Migraine without aura however is a fuzzier issue  There do not
seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function  The
Copenhagen mafia Lauritzen Olesen et al have done local CBF
studies on migraine without aura and unlike migraine with aura
but like tensiontype they found no changes in LCBF

From one absurd perspective all pain is neurologic because in
the absence of a nervous system there would not be pain  From
another tautologic perspective any disease is in the domain of
the specialty that treats it  Neurologists treat headache
therefore at least in the USA headache is neurologic

Whether neurologic or not nobody would disagree that disabling
headaches are common  Perhaps my feeforservice neurologic
colleagues scrounging for cases want all the headache patients
they can get  Working on a salary however I would rather not fill
my office with patients holding their heads in pain

the medical community doesn't know I'm surprised that he has this outlook

Duh

Nice to see Steve still has his high and almighty intellectual prowess 
in tact

For the record I have had several outbreaks of thrush during the several 
past few years with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional 
deficiencies I had not taken any antobiotics 

Listen thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite
characteristics  If you have thrush you have thrush because you can
see the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it it generally
responds well if you're not otherwise immunocompromised  Noring's
analretentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses
is not even in the same category here nor are these walking neurasthenics
who are convinced they have candida from reading a quack book

Yawn

My dentist who sees a fair amount of thrush recommended acidophilous
After I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis the outbreaks ceased
When I quit taking the acidophilous the outbreaks periodically resumed 
I resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then

So

Exactly my question to you Steve What's your point This person had
one you didn't

Nice to see that some things never change Steve if you aren't being

And to add further fuel to the flame war I read about  years ago that
the natural MSG  extracted from the sources you mention above  does not
cause the reported aftereffects it's only that nasty artificial MSG 
extracted from coal tar or whatever  that causes Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome  I find this pretty hard to believe has anyone else heard it

MSG is mono sodium glutamate a fairly straight forward compound If it is
pure the source should not be a problem Your comment suggests that 
impurities may be the cause
My experience of MSG effects as part of a double blind study was that the
pure stuff caused me some rather severe effects

I was under the possibly incorrect assumption that most of the MSG on
our foods was made from processing sugar beets Is this not true Are 
there other sources of MSG

Soya bean fermented cheeses mushrooms all contain MSG 

I am one of those folx who react sometimes strongly to MSG However
I also react strongly to sodium chloride table salt in excess Each
causes different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat
and an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in my chest upper left quadrant

The symptoms I had were numbness of jaw muscles in the first instance
followed by the arms then the legs headache lethargy and unable to keep
awake I think it may well affect people differently

Hello

I am writing a grant proposal for a Developmental Genetics class and I
have chose to look at the Neurofibromatosis  gene and its variable
expressivity  I am curious what has already been done on this subject
especially the relationship between specific mutations and the resulting
phenotype  My literature search has produce many references but I want to
make sure I am proposing new research  If anyone knows aything that has been
recently or key peopl doing research to search for using MEDLINE I would
apprciate being informed

Thank you

And to add further fuel to the flame war I read about  years ago that
the natural MSG  extracted from the sources you mention above  does not
cause the reported aftereffects it's only that nasty artificial MSG 
extracted from coal tar or whatever  that causes Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome  I find this pretty hard to believe has anyone else heard it
 
 MSG is mono sodium glutamate a fairly straight forward compound If it is
 pure the source should not be a problem Your comment suggests that 
 impurities may be the cause
 My experience of MSG effects as part of a double blind study was that the
 pure stuff caused me some rather severe effects
 
I was under the possibly incorrect assumption that most of the MSG on
our foods was made from processing sugar beets Is this not true Are 
there other sources of MSG
 
 Soya bean fermented cheeses mushrooms all contain MSG 
 
I am one of those folx who react sometimes strongly to MSG However
I also react strongly to sodium chloride table salt in excess Each
causes different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat
and an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in my chest upper left quadrant
 
 The symptoms I had were numbness of jaw muscles in the first instance
 followed by the arms then the legs headache lethargy and unable to keep
 awake I think it may well affect people differently

Well I think msg is made from a kind of plant call tapioca and not those
staff you mentiond above

I don't know if anyone knows about this topic electrical heart 
failure One of my friends has had to go to the doctor because
he had chest pains The Doc said it was Arythmia So he had to
go to a new york hospital for a lot of money to get treated His
doctors said that he could die from it and the medication caused
cancer  that he was taking Well I suggested that he run excersize
and eat more  he is very skinny but he says that has nothing
to do with it Does anyone know what causes arythmia and how 
it can be treated

There is a person on the FIDO CFS echo who claims that he was cured of
CFS by taking accutane  He also claims that you are using it in the
treatment of Fibromyalgia Syndrome  Are you using accutane in the
treatment of Fibromyalgia Syndrome
 
Yes
 
Have you used it for CFS
 
It seems to work equally well for CFS another hint that these may be
different facets of the same underlying process
 
Have you gotten good results with it
 
Yes  The benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it
Most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued lowdose
amitriptyline daily aerobic excersise and a regular sleep schedule
current standard therapy  Because of the cost usually  mo
depending on dose and potential for significant side effects like
corneal injury and birth defects I currently reserve it for those who
fail conventional treatment  It is important that the person
prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient
closely
 
Are you aware of any double blind studies on the use of accutane in
these conditions  Thank you in advance for all replies
 
As far as I know I am the only person looking at it currently  I
should get off my duff and finish writing up some case reports  I'm not
an academic physician so I don't feel the pressure to publish or perish
and I don't have the time during the work day for such things

Medicine is not a totally scientific endevour
 
The acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific  The
application of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than
science
 
There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause
of many diseases now described aren't known Read a book on
gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them After
scientific methods have run out then it's the patient's freedom of
choice to try any experimental method they choose And it's well
recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn't have all the answers
 
Certainly we don't have all the answers  The question is what is the
most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge  The
scientific method has proven itself to be reliable  The only reason
alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their
practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific
scrutiny insisting that tradition or anecdotal evidence are
sufficient  These have been shown many times in the past to be very
unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge  Crook's ideas have
never been backed up by scientific evidence  His unwillingness to do
good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions

In article jschwimmerwccnetwccwesleyanedu jschwimmerwccnetwccwesleyanedu Josh Schwimmer writes

I've recently listened to a tape by Dr Stanislaw Burzynski in which he 
claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti
cancer properties that he names antineoplastons  Burzynski says that his 
work has met with hostility in the United States despite the favorable 
responses of his subjects during clinical trials

What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr Burzynski's research  He 
paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an 
intolerant medical establishment but I have no basis from which to judge 
his claims  Two weeks ago however I read that the NIH's Department of 
Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski's 
work  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate a 
treatment that didn't seem promising

Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current 
status of his research would be appreciated


Joshua Schwimmer
jschwimmereaglewesleyanedu

There's been extensive discussion on the CompuServe Cancer Forum about Dr 
Burzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's father 
to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma  This disease is 
universally and usually rapidly fatal  After diagnosis in June  the 
tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy  The forum 
member checked extensively on Dr Burzynki's track record for this disease  
He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from 
glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had 
audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive  
After the forum member's father began Dr Burzynski's treatment in 
September all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his 
oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of 
shrinkage or necrosis

The patient's oncologist although telling him he would probably not live 
past December  was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr Burzynski's 
treatment  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr Burzynski's 
treatment she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these 
treatments saying if it ain't broke don't fix it

Dr Burzynski is an MD PhD with a research background who found a 
protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients synthesized it 
and administers it to patients with certain cancer types  There is little 
understanding of the actual mechanism of activity

I'm looking for good background and review paper references that can help me

particular I'm not interested in translational behavior and cell motility
but rather in the internal motions of the cytoskeleton and its components
under normal and transformed circumstances

Also I'd appreciate any data on force constants mechanical and elastic
properties of microtubules and viscous properties of cytoplasm  Any other

be useful to me

Anecedotal evidence is worthless  Even doctors who have been using a drug

Living things maintain small electric fields to  enhance certain
chemical reactions  promote communication of states with in a cell
 communicate between cells of which the nervous system is a specialized
example and perhaps other uses  These electric fields change with location
and time in a large organism  Special photographic techniques such as applying
external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances
caused by these fields to make interesting pictures Perhaps such pictures will
be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood Perhaps not

Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred
years old but not a popular activity  Perhaps except in the case of a few
tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes it is hard to reduce the
investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed  There are some
hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding
the healing of broken bones but not understood why

Bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism Ideas such as Frankenstein
reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as
when Volta invented the battery  I personally don't care to revert to supernatural
cause to explain things we don't yet understand

no knots or lumps just a little sore spot  He says it reminds him of

that that would cause a bruise He asssures me he'd remember something

My dentist who sees a fair amount of thrush recommended acidophilous
After I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis the outbreaks ceased
When I quit taking the acidophilous the outbreaks periodically resumed 
I resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then

This is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction
between real disease caused by Candida albicans and the disease
that was being asked about systemic yeast syndrome

There is no question that Candida albicans causes thrush  It also
seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous
may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush  I've 
never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before though 
presumably it would work by the same mechanism

Candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major
pathogen  That does not mean that there is evidence that it causes
the systemic yeast syndrome

Hello

I am interested in trying this desensitization  method
against hay fever
What is the state of affairs about this I went to a doctor and
paid  for a  minute interview   scratches leading to the
diagnostic that I am allergic to June and Timothy grass
I believe this From now on it looks like  shots per week for
 months followed by  shot per month or so Each shot costs
 Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system I would
call that a racket We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses
here but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office
Apart from this issue I was somewhat disappointed to find out
that you have to keep getting the shots forever Is that right
Thanks for information

intended for  

	My dad was a lawyer  as such I grew up with being a stickler
for meaning  In my reality psychoactives technically could 
range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more
standard recreational drugs  In practice I had hoped to see it
limited to those that were above some psychoactive level  like
some of the drugs you mention but also possibly including some
recreational drugs  but with conversation limited to their psychoactive 
effects  the recent query about bong water I thought was a bit
off topic  so I just hit k

	But back to the original question  what is a workable solution 
what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to
discuss  It sounds like there should be a altsmartdrugs or something
similar  I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to
describe alot of those drugs  There is a big difference between a
drug that if taken in certain doses over a period of days may have
a psychoactive effect in some people vs many of the drugs in

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who   
themselves has AIDSit is unlikely not impossible they will get AIDS        
from acupuncture needles Generally even if accidently inoculated the normal
immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant 
involved with acupuncture needle insertion 

Isn't this what HIV is about  the normal immune response to an exposure

Most acupuncturists use disposable needlesuse once and throw away

I had electrical pulse nerve testing done a while back  The needles were taken
from a dirty drawer in an instrument cart and were most certainly NOT
sterile or even clean for that matter  More than likely they were fresh
from the previous patient  I WAS concerned but I kept my mouth shut  I
probably should have raised hell

A couple of folks have suggested the corn connection  In the five month
period between the two seizures my daughter had eaten a fair amount of
Kix and Berry Berry Kix in the mornings and never had a problem  I checked
the labels and the first ingredient is corn  She has also never had a problem
eating corn or corn on the cob but of course that is usually later in the day
with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high  I do believe that
Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have to check the Fruit Loops  But
the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me
wonder

Thanks for checking into this  All information at this point is valuable to me

 Now I'm not saying that culturing is the best way to diagnose it's very
 hard to culture Bb in most cases  The point is that Dr N has developed a
 feel for what is and what isn't LD  This comes from years of experience
 No serology can match that  Unfortunately some would call Dr N a quack
 and accuse him of trying to make a quick buck
 
 Why do you think he would be called a quack  The quacks don't do cultures
 They poopoo doing more lab tests  this is Lyme believe me I've
 seen it many times  The lab tests aren't accurate  We'll treat it
 now  Also is Dr N's practice almost exclusively devoted to treating
 Lyme patients  I don't know any orthopedic surgeons who fit this
 pattern  They are usually GPs

No he does not exclusively treat LD patients  However in some parts of the
country you don't need to be known as an LD specialist to see a large
number of LD patients walk through your office  Given the huge problem of
underdiagnosis orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just
about every day in their regular practices  Dr N told me that last year
he sent between  and  patients a week to the LD specialists and he is not
the only orthopedists in the town

Let's say that only  people per week actually have LD  That means at the
very minimum  people in our town and immediate area develop late stage
manifestations of LD every year  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by
neurologists rheumatologists GPs etc and you can see what kind of problem
we have  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD
patient

He refers most patients to LD specialists but in extreme cases he puts the
patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage in most cases to
the knees

Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs

Hismanal astemizole is most definitely linked to weight gain
It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect
and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly
doesn't cross the bloodbrain barrier and so tends not to cause
drowsiness

The original poster mentioned fatigue  I had that too but it was
mostly due to the really bizarre dreams I was having  I wasn't getting
any rest  My doctor said that was a common reaction  If astemizole
doesn't cross the bloodbrain barrier how does it cause that side
effect  Any ideas

It made me really BITCHY for the first few weeks  Now that I think about
it I was having some bizarre dreams too  My doctor said it made him feel
like he had to be DOING something all the time  But if you keep taking it
after a few weeks these symptoms seem to go away he said hang in there  
I did and they did

                      TUTORIAL PROGRAM
Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on 
Tuesday July 

pm Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer 
 Scientists  Prof Mick Noordewier Rutgers University

This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is 
intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists 
who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain  
Material covered will include structural and informational 
molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic 
material the central dogma of gene expression and selected 
other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as 
relates to current computational approaches  Dr Noordewier has 
appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers and 
has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition 
to his current work in computational biology

pm Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for 
 Biologists  Dr Richard Lathrop MIT  Arris Corp

An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be 
presented as it relates to actual and potential biological 
applications  Fundamental techniques symbolic programming 
languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as 
selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge 
representation inference and machine learning  The intended 
audience includes biologists with some computational background 
but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence  Dr 
Lathrop codeveloper of ARIADNE and related technologies has 
worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to 
biological problems in both academia and industry

pm Neural Networks Statistics and Information Theory 
 in Biological Sequence Analysis Dr Alan Lapedes Los Alamos 
 National Laboratory 

This tutorial will cover the most rapidlyexpanding facet of 
intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine 
learning techniques applied to sequence analysis  Closely 
interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical 
neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general 
characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such 
approaches to statistical techniques and informationtheoretic 
views of sequence data  Dr Lapedes of the Theoretical 
Division at Los Alamos has long been a leader in the use of such 
techniques in this domain

pm Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming 
 Prof John Koza Stanford University

The genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly 
nonlinear multidimensional optimization problems was originally 
inspired by a biological metaphor  This tutorial will cover both 
the biological motivations and the actual implementation and 
characteristics of the algorithm  Genetic Programming an 
extension wellsuited to problems where the discovery of the size 
and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will 
also be addressed  Particular attention will be paid to 
biological applications and to identifying resources and software 
that will permit attendees to begin using the methods  Dr Koza 
a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford has taught 
this subject since  and is the author of a standard text in 
the field

pm Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis 
 Prof David Searls University of Pennsylvania 
  Shmuel Pietrokovski Weizmann Institute

Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies 
are increasingly in evidence  These involve the adaptation of 
tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic 
pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of 
genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the 
identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes 
in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and 
functional relatedness  Dr Searls who holds research faculty 
appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn 
represents the branch of this field that considers higherorder 
syntactic approaches to sequence data while Shmuel Pietrokovski 
has studied and published with Prof Edward Trifinov in the area 
of wordbased analyses

A friend of mine is seeing an acupuncturist and
wants to know if there is any danger of getting
AIDS from the needles

	Ask the practitioner whether he uses the presterilized disposable
needles or if he reuses needles sterilizing them between use  In the
former case there's no conceivable way to get AIDS from the needles  In
the latter case it's highly unlikely though many practitioners use the
disposable variety anyway

It is illegal to perform acupuncture with unsterilized needles No licensed
practitioner would dare do this Also there is not a single documented case
of transmission of AIDS via acupuncture needles I wouldn't worry about it

A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohn's
disease

But she can't seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence

Her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
problems of people with Crohn's disease 

I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric

Thanks in advance

Can you provide a reference to substantiate that gaining back
the lost weight does not constitute weight rebound until it
exceeds the starting weight  Or is this oral tradition that
is shared only among you obesity researchers

Annals of NY Acad Sci 

Hmmm These don't look like references to me Is passiveaggressive
behavior associated with weight rebound 

I purposefully left off the page numbers to encourage the reader to
study the volumes mentioned and benefit therefrom


Good story Chuck but it won't wash  I have read the NY Acad Sci
one and have it  This AM I couldn't find any reference to
weight rebound  I'm not saying it isn't there but since you
cited it it is your responsibility to show me where it is in there
There is no index  I suspect you overstepped your knowledge base
as usual

It is about drug resistant microorganisms  the history of antibiotics  It
is interesting  written at a level which I think many scimed readers would
appreciate  which is  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of
understanding scientific concepts but who may not yet have been exposed to
this particular information Ie it assumes you are smart enough to
understand it but it does not assume that you already have a degree in
microbiology or medicine Table of contents

The mass of anectdotal evidence combined with the lack of
a properly constructed scientific experiment disproving
the hypothesis makes the MSG reaction hypothesis the
most likely explanation for events

   The following is from a critique of a  Minutes presentation on MSG
   which was aired on November rd   The critique comes from THE TUFTS
   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER February   edited for brevity

	Chances are good that if you watched ' Minutes' last November
	rd  you came away feeling MSG is bad for you  In
	the segment entitled 'No MSG' for instance show host Ed Bradley
	makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them
	'millions are suffering a host of symptoms and some get violently
	sick' peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven
	personal testimony and speaks of studies on MSG that make the
	substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive 
	those studies are

	Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to
	a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order
	to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG
	a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as
	in many supermarket items causes headaches  What he does NOT
	make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on
	humans but on rabbits

	One of the researchers who conducted the study pharmacologist
	Patricia Williams PhD says it certainly is conceivable that
	a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get 
	headaches from it  'But' she explains 'the show probably 
	overemphasized the extent of the problem'

	A second lapse comes with mention of Dr John Olney a professor
	at the Washington University School of Medicine who Mr Bradley
	remarks 'says that his  years of research with laboratory
	animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because
	it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage  Dr Olney's
	research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human
	youngsters

	In fact only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr Olney's 
	experiments ever bring about any brain damage when he injected
	extremely high doses of MSG into rodents completely bypassing 
	their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly
	and when he used tubes to forcefeed huge amounts of the substance
	to very young animals on an empty stomach  Of course neither
	of those procedures occurs with humans they simply take in MSG 
	with food  And most of what they take in is broken down by
	enzymes in the wall of the small intestine so that very little
	reaches the bloodstream  much to little in fact for human
	blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations
	found in Dr Olney's lab animals

	The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of
	that fact  And so does the European Communities' Scientific
	Committee for FoodBoth after examining numerous studies
	have concluded that MSG is safe

	Their determination makes sense considering that MSG has never
	been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed
	to it  headaches swelling a tightness in the chest and a
	burning sensation among others  In fact the most failsafe
	of clinical studies the doubleblind study has consistently
	exonerated the muchmaligned substance

	That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of
	monosodium glutamate glutamate enters our systems whenever
	we eat any food that contains protein  The reason is that one
	of the amino acids that make up protein glutamic acid is broken
	down into glutamate during digestion

	It's a breakdown that occurs frequently  Glutamic acid is the
	most abundant of the  or so amino acids in the diet  It makes
	up about  percent of the protein in flesh foods  percent in
	milk  percent in corn and  percent in whole wheat

	That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number
	of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore
	sensitive to itThe consensus reached by large international
	professional organizations is that MSG is safe the same consensus
	reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large

You probably mean RoHypnol a member of the benzodiazepine family

 Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor
 
 Last Saturday evening my  year old son cut his finger badly with a knife
 I took him to a local Urgent and General Care clinic at  pm  The 
 clinic was open till  pm  The receptionist went to the back and told the 
 doctor that we were there and came back and told us the doctor would not 
 see us because she had someplace to go at  and did not want to be delayed 
 here  During the next few minutes in response to my questions with several 
 trips to the back room the receptionist told me
 	 the doctor was doing paperwork in the back
 	 the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going
 	  to the emergency room
 	 the doctor would not even speak to me
 	 she would not tell me the doctor's name or her own name
 	 when asked who is in charge of the clinic she said I don't know
 
 I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room but
 I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to
 be bothered  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room  

Speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center the above
behavior is completely inappropriate If a patient who requires extensive
care shows up at the last minute we always see them and give them appropriate
care It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its
posted hours but what you describe is misbehavior Ask to speak to the
clinic director and complain Whatever their attitude they have nothing to
gain from angering patients

If she is having problems with fresh vegetables the guess is that there
is some obstruction of the intestine  Without knowing more it is not
possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring
or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine  In general there are
no dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate
to obstruction  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on 
recurrence of Crohn's  It is important to distinguish recurrence from
recurrent symptoms  A physician would think of new inflammation as 
recurrence while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the
intestine  

Your friend should look into membership in the Crohn's and Colitis 
Foundation of America   

Good luck to your friend

        In case you don't know Krillean Photography to the best of my
knowledge involves taking pictures of an most of the time organic
object between charged plates The picture will show energy patterns
or spikes around the object photographed and depending on what type
of object it is the spikes or energy patterns will vary One might
extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
the universe as we know it has its own energy signature


To construct a Kirlian device find a copy of Handbook of Psychic

dark room then made the exposure put it back in the film pack and
ran it out through the rollers of the camera forinstant developing

Photography is really and what it is not  As you know all ready
it is the pattern in the bioplasmic energy fieldthat is significant
Variations caused by exposure time distance from the plate or
pressure on the plate or variations in the photo materials are not
important

I can not believe the way this thread on candidayeast has progressed
Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci 
Med Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women 
poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did 
not exist  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I 
see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well  

Let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have 
no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that 
balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics  These are the physicians 
who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go 
from doctor to doctor to find relieflike Elaine in Sci Med Nutrition and 
then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling 
quack  Could it just be professional jealousy  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon
but somebody else did  Could they know more than Me  No way they must be a 
quack  

I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten 
years now and guess who the most receptive students are  Those that were 
raised on farms and saw firsthand the effect of diet on the health of their 
farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to 
entering medical schoolswitched to the vegan diet  Typically this is 
about  of my class of  students  Those not interested in nutrition 
either tune me out or just stop coming to class  That's okay because I 
know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at 
least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the US  It's really 
too bad that most US medical schools don't cover nutrition because if 
they did candida would not be viewed as a nondisease by so many in the 
medical profession

In animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after 
antibiotics are stopped  Medicine has decided that since humans do not 
have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is 
needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic  Humans have all 
kinds of different organisms living in the GI systemmouth stomach small 
and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin  These are 
nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune 
system is compromised  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike 
the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce 
toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body  But any of 
these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up 
residence within the body  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this 
happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier
Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using antifungals 
and vitamin A for her GI problems  If Steve really understoood what 
vitamin A does in the body he would notor at least should not be calling 
Elaine's doctor a quack

Here is a brief primer on yeast  Yeast infections as they are commonly 
called are not truely caused by yeasts  The most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a 
yeastlike fungus  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis
Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an E Coli infection it 
requires that the host immune system be severly depressed  

Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of 
normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing
factor is present such as a high blood glucose leveldiabetes or an oral 
course of antibiotics has been used  In diabetics their secretions contain 
much higher amounts of glucose  Candida unlike bacteria is very limited in 
it's foodfuel selection  Without glucose it can not grow it just barely 
survives  If it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides 
the other organisms living with it in the sinuses GI tract or vagina  In 
diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little 
buggers  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but 
some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
membrane or skin bloom site  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
the candida or not isn't certain  When the bloom is in the vagina or on 
the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it
If it's internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
nondiscript  


Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in 
the sinuses the GI tractmouth stomach and intestines and in the 
vaginal tract which compete with it for food  The human immune system 
ususally does not bother itself with thesenonpathogenic organisms unless 
they broach the mucus membrane barrier  If they do an inflammatory 
response will be set up  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A 
from their diets  About  of all American's die with less Vitamin A than 
they were born withUS autopsy studies  While this low level of vitamin 
A does not cause pathologyblindness it does impair the mucus membrane 
barrier system  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong 
inflammatory response after a candida bloom  

While diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the  most common cause of 
this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which 
knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main 
competition for candida as far as food is concerned  While drugs are 
available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not 
use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection  The toxicity of 
the antifungal drugs does warrant some caution  But if the GI or sinus 
inflammation is suspected to be candidaand recent use of a broad spectrum 
antibiotic is the smoking gun then antifungal use should be approrpriate 
just as the antifungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring 
vaginal yeast infections in spite of what Mr Steve Dyer says

But even in patients being given the antifungals the irritation caused by 
the excessive candida bloom in the sinus GI tract or the vagina tends to 
return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of 
the problem is addressedlack of a good bacterial flora in the body andor 
poor mucus membrane barrier  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective 
therapy for candida overgrowth  From it's name it is an acid loving 
organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows  Candida can not 
grow very well in an acidic environment  In the vagina L acidophilius is 
the predominate bacteriaunless you are hit with broad spectrum 
antibiotics  

In the GI system the anorectal region seems to be a particularly good 
reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very 
favorable environment around the rectum for transferthrough moisture and 
humidity of candida to the vaginal tract  One of the most effctive ways to 
minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear  

If the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even 
blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids  If the 
bloom manages to move further up the GI tract very diffuse symptomatology 
occursabdominal discomfort and blood in the stool  This positive stool 
for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first 
place  After extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong 
but her gut still hurt  On to another doctor and so on  Richard Kaplan 
has told me throiugh email that he considers occult blood tests in stool 
specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of 
false positivescandida blooms guys  If my gut hurt me on a constant 
basis I would want it fixed  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have 
colon cancer but what then is causing my distress  When I finally find a 
doctor who treats me and gets me  better Steve Dyer calls him a quack

Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria 
tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment  The vagina becomes alkaline 
during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina 
Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal 
problems  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of 
Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tractI would want to be sure of 
the purity of the product before trying this  My wife had this vagina 
problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year 
until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting 
scripts for antifungal creams  This was a woman gynocologist who had had 
the same problemrecurring vaginal yeast infections  This MD did some 
digging and came up with an acetic acid and L Acidophilis douche which she 
used in your office to keep it sterile  After three treatments sex 
returned to our marraige  I have often wondered what an MD with chronic 
GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
patients is a nonexistent syndrome

The nonpathogenic bacteria L acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria 
which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women  
If taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut  Through 
aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes
But before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system 
needs to be strengthened  This is accomplished by vitamin A vitamin C and 
some of the Bcomplex vitamins  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans 
are not getting enough B and folate  These are probably the segement of 
the population that will have the greatest problem with this nonexistent 
disordercandida blooms after antibiotic therapy
 
Some of the above material was obtained from Natural Healing by Mark 
Bricklin Published by Rodale press as well as notes from my human 
nutrition course  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in 
the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely 
important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in 
the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida 
blooms  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate 
intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the GI 
system is involved  If candida can not get glucose it's not going to out 
grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and 
fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check 
once carbohydrate is returned to the gut

If Steve and some of the other naysayers want to jump all over this post 
fine  I jumped all over Steve in Sci Med Nutrition because he verbably 
accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin 
A and antifungals for a candida bloom in her gut  People seeking advice 
from newsnet should not be treated this way  Those of us giving of our 
time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content  If you saved 
your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly 
seeking help alone I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior

First let me offer you my condolences  I've had kidney stones  times 
and I know the pain she is going through  First it is best that she see 
a doctor  However every time I had kidney stones I saw my doctor and the
only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a
urinary tract infection  The pain killers did nothing for mekidney stones
are extremely painful  My stones were judged passable so we just waited it
out  However the last one took  days to passnot fun  Anyway if she
absolutely won't see a doctor I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps
an over the counter sleeping pill  But I do highly suggest seeing a doctor
Kidney stones are not something to fool around with  She should be xrayed 
to make sure there is not a serious problem

Interesting statements simply because I have been told otherwise  I'm
certainly not questioning Steve's claims as for one I am not a doctor and I
agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's  But inflammation
can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food

Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection is that a good enough
caveat  I was told that a LOW RESIDUE diet is called for  Basically
the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut which may not be
realized by the patient any residue in the system can be caught in the folds
of inflammation and constantly irritate thus exacerbating the problem
Therefore anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common
inflammation should be avoided  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's
of the terminal ileum my diet should be low residue consisting of

Completely out  never again  items
	o corn kernel husk doesn't digest  most of us know this 
	o popcorn same
	o dried dehydrated fruit and fruit skins
	o nuts Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge 

Discouraged greatly
	o raw vegetables too fibrous
	o wheat and raw grain breads
	o exotic lettuce iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water
	o greens turnip mustard kale etc
	o little seeds like sesame try getting an Arby's without it
	o long grain and wild rice husky
	o beans you'll generate enough gas alone without them
	o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing

I was told that the more processed the food the better rather ironic in this
day and age  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE  you want to give your
system as little chance to inflame as possible  I was told that among the
NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged I only listed a few to try
the ones I wanted and see how I felt  If it's bad don't do it again
Remember though that this was while I was in remission  For Veggies cook the
daylights out of them  I prefer steaming  I think it's cooks more
thoroughly  you're mileage may vary

As with anything else CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR  Don't just take my word  But
this is the info I've been given and it may be a starting point for
discussion  Good luck

Hi

we are just completing a project on nebuliser performance and have a
wealth of data on particle size and output which we are going to use
to adjudicate a contract next week

Although the output data is easy for us to present there seems to be
little concensus on the optimum diameter of the nebulised droplets for
straightforward inhalation therapy eg for asthmatics

Some say that the droplets must be smaller than  microns whilst
others say that if they are too small they will not be effective

Anyone up on this topic who could summarise the current status 

Cheers

 A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohn's

 But she can't seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables

 Her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
 problems of people with Crohn's disease 
 
 I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric
 
 Thanks in advance
 John Eyles

All your friend really has to do is find a Registered DieticianRD  While 
most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have RD's who 
are in private practice so to speak  Many physicans will refer their 
patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help  If you can get 
your friend's physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for 
the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist  The 
better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's 
plan doesn't it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to 
control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and 
lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but 
I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors  For 
bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects 
are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use  Upjohn is developing 
a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with 
inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet

sure to inject deeply a different kind of pain is felt when the

I can not believe the way this thread on candidayeast has progressed
Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci 
Med Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman 
poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did 
not exist  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I 
see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well  

They are just responding in their natural way  HyperCholeric Syndrome HCS
Oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community
better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist  

Actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians
will type out as NT for those not familiar with the MyersBriggs system
just email me and I'll send a summary file to you  In the general
population NT's comprise only about  of the population but among
physicians it is much much higher I don't know the exact percentage 
any help here apper's

One driving characteristic of an NT especially an NTJ is their obvious
choleric behavior driver type A etc  the extreme emotional need to
control to lead andor to be the best or the most competent  If they are
also extroverted they are best described as Field Marshalls  This trait
is very valuable and essential in our society  we need people who want to
lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge
to raise the level of competency etc  The great successes in science and
technology are in large part due to the vision an N trait and scientifically
minded approach T trait of the NT personality of course the other types
and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well  However
when the NT person has selfimage challenges the darkside of this
personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all

A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their
temperament will be extremely businesslike lack of empathy or feeling
and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patient
must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question  I've
known many MD's of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them
with a followup visit no matter how competent I think they are and they
usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an
extreme drive of theirs  to know the most to know it all

Maybe we need more NF doctor's  

Enough on this subject  let's move on to candida bloom


Let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have 
no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that 
balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics  Could it just be
professional jealousy  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did

You've helped me already by your post  Of course I believe that I have
been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis' but being
the phlegmatic I am maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people
myself in past posts  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion
above the level of anal effluent


Humans have all 
kinds of different organisms living in the GI system mouth stomach small 
and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin  These are 
nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune 
system is compromised  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike 
the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce 
toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body  But any of 
these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up 
residence within the body  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this 
happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier

In my welldescribed situation in prior posts I definitely was immune
stressed  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low  My sinuses
were a mess  no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged
I also was on antibiotics  times in  years  In the end even two weeks
of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial
infection of the sinuses via catscans mucus color won't get into the
details and other symptoms  Three very traditional ENT's made this
diagnosis I did not have any cultures done however because of the
difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed
a bacterial infection  Enough of this background provided to help you
understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox antifungal
therapy below


The first question I have is this  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor
mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being
considered 'systemic' in the classic sense  It is sort of an inbetween
infection


Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using antifungals 
and vitamin A for her GI problems  If Steve really understoood what 
vitamin A does in the body he would notor at least should not be calling 
Elaine's doctor a quack

I was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin A  My doctor after
my blood tests put me on  IU of vitamin A for one week only then
dropped it down to  IU for the next couple of weeks  I also received
zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly
complex ways as my doctor explained he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular
specialists  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal
he then stopped me on all vitamin A except for some in a multivitamin
supplement and made sure that I maintain a  IUday of beta carotene
Call me carrot face  

Hopefully Elaine's doctor will take a similar careful approach and to
all supplements  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking for
example niacin in fairly large dosages  gramday which Steve Dyer had
good information about on scimednutrition  If niacin only has secondorder
improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is
not worth taking such a large dose longterm and risking liver damage


survives  If it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides 
the other organisms living with it in the sinuses GI tract or vagina  In 

Though I do now believe based on my successful therapy with Sporanox that
I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in my
sinuses I still want to ask the question  have there been any studies that
demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation
sinusitisrhinitis  My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one
week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this
time  I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on
Sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away  considered
normal

BTW my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry can't
remember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the 's
which stated that people can develop contained nonlethal or nonserious
aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinus
inflammation symptoms  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it
is relevant to this discussion


some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
membrane or skin bloom site  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
the candida or not isn't certain

My doctor tested me I believe a RAST or RAST similar test for allergic
response to specificially Candida albicans and I showed a strong positive
Another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test
is essentially useless  And assuming it is true that Candida can grow
partway into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a 
threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to
Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane
irritation due to the body's allergic response  As I said in an earlier post
one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a MD degree or a 
PhD in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis

BTW and I'll repost this again  Dr Ivker in his book Sinus Survival
has routinely given before anything else Nizoral a preSporanox systemic
antifungal not as safe and not as good as Sporanox to his new chronic
sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in
the last two years  He claims that out of  or so patients well over
 notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it
doesn't cure it by any means implying the socalled yeastfungus infection
is not the primary cause but a later complication  He's also found that
nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help

This implies of course assuming that excessive yeastfungus bloom is
aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeastfungus has grown partway
into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeastfungus other than by
direct contact  it is not absorbed into the blood stream  Again I admit
lots of 'ifs' and 'implies' which doesn't please the hardcore NT who
has to have the doubleblind study or it's a nonissue but one has to start
with some plausible hypothesisexplanation a strawman if you will


If it's internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
nondescript  

This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny
and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the
appropriate studies are done  And that is if you can't observe or culture
the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there's no way to diagnose or
even recognize the disease  And I know they realize that it is virtually
impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot
be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body

It's a real Catch

Another Catch  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that
no studies have been done actually studies have been done but if it's not
up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a nonstudy which
should not even be considered  I agree that the appropriate studies should
be done and that will take big  to do it right  However in order to
convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets
you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to
compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study
needed funding  That is you have to do  of the study before you even get
funding as a scientist at a National Lab I'm very aware of this for the
smaller funded projects  I'm afraid that even if Dr Ivker and  other
doctors got together pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes
into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get
nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results

It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have
decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to
noticeable nonlethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable
hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence
to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would
also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue  
excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will
not and cannot exist  Period  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold
such a viewpoint  Kind of reminds me of Lister


Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in 
the sinuses the GI tractmouth stomach and intestines and in the 
vaginal tract which compete with it for food  The human immune system 
ususally does not bother itself with thesenonpathogenic organisms unless 
they broach the mucus membrane barrier  If they do an inflammatory 
response will be set up  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A 
from their diets  About  of all American's die with less Vitamin A than 
they were born withUS autopsy studies  While this low level of vitamin 
A does not cause pathologyblindness it does impair the mucus membrane 
barrier system  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong 
inflammatory response after a candida bloom  

Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the
sinus mucus membranes and cilia


While diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the  most common cause of 
this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which 
knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main 
competition for candida as far as food is concerned  While drugs are 
available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not 
use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection  The toxicity of 
the antifungal drugs does warrant some caution  But if the GI or sinus 
inflammation is suspected to be candidaand recent use of a broad spectrum 
antibiotic is the smoking gun then antifungal use should be approrpriate 
just as the antifungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring 
vaginal yeast infections in spite of what Mr Steve Dyer says

Again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeastfungus
species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growing
in bread  You can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but
you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic
antifungal such as itraconazole Sporanox or some of the older ones such
as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective  This is why as has
been pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor I've been in
email contact with  thanks that nystatin is not effective in the long
term treatment of GI tract candidiasis  It's like trying to weed a garden
by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come
out again once you walk away

The  question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially
grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms
in susceptible people eg allergy without becoming systemic in the
classical sense of the word  something in between strictly an excessive
bloom not causing any problems and the fullblown systemic infection that
is potentially lethal


In the GI system the anorectal region seems to be a particularly good 
reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very 
favorable environment around the rectum for transferthrough moisture and 
humidity of candida to the vaginal tract  One of the most effctive ways to 
minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear  

Also if one is an 'anal retentive' like I've been diagnosed in a prior
post that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth  


If the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even 
blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids  If the 
bloom manages to move further up the GI tract very diffuse symptomatology 
occursabdominal discomfort and blood in the stool  This positive stool 
for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first 
place  After extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong 
but her gut still hurt  On to another doctor and so on  Richard Kaplan 
has told me throiugh email that he considers occult blood tests in stool 
specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of 
false positivescandida blooms guys  If my gut hurt me on a constant 
basis I would want it fixed  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have 
colon cancer but what then is causing my distress  When I finally find a 
doctor who treats me and gets me  better Steve Dyer calls him a quack

As I've said in private email there are flaws in our current medical system
that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt
alternative therapies AFTER the approvedprovenaccepted therapies don't work
For example I went to three ENT's who all said that I will just have to live
with my acutechronic sinusitis after the ab's failed they did mention
surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not
get to the root cause of my condition  After three months of aggressive and
fairly nonstandard therapy Sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and
equalization vitamin C lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastly
improved to where I was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated
Of course skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have
improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the
experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to live with
it  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total cure  The
antifungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction
because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years  Note  for those
having sinus problems may I suggest the book by Dr Ivker I mention above
Be sure to get the revised edition


I have often wondered what an MD with chronic 
GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
patients is a nonexistent syndrome

Dr Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his
visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said you'll just have
to live with it  He spent several years trying everything  standard and
nonstandard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis  He now
shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road
to recovery following some parts of it  His one recommendation to take a
systemic antifungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of
antibiotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own
practice  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hardcore beliefs of the anti
yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as
it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly
I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating
their moral obligations to help the patient

Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are
confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical
yeast overgrowth eg they fit some of the profiles the proyeast people
have identified should consider antifungal therapy IF all other avenues
have been exhausted  Remember theory and practice are two different things 
you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic  If a doctor does
something nonstandard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a
thousand of his patients shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice
Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works
instead of why it shouldn't work  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become
so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients
they have sworn to help  You have to do both  both have to be balanced which
we don't see from some of the posters to this group  There comes a point when
you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach
such as trying a good systemic antifungal such as Sporanox after having
exhausted all the other avenues  I was one of those who the traditional
medical establishment was not able to help so I did the natural thing  I
went to a couple of doctor's who are somewhat outside this establishment
and as a result I have found significant relief

Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up
some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having
his license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt
therapies for hisher patients that finally reach the point where all the
accepted therapies are ineffective  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me
well I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this
country and since they clearly don't work for you I now have the authority
to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others  I
can't promise anything and there are some risks  You will have to sign
something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of
these unproven therapies and I'll have to register your case at the State
Board  Anyway if my ENT had suggested this to me I would've jumped on this
pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic
reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much
risk to himher risk meaning losing their license and possibly to the
patient  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine
and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free  It also would
be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the
compassion of the medical community to the patient  that it's doing everything
it can within reason to help the patient  It is the lack of such a mechanism
that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of
which seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at all
true quackery

I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches K in size


If taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut  Through 
aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes
But before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system 
needs to be strengthened  This is accomplished by vitamin A vitamin C and 
some of the Bcomplex vitamins  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans 
are not getting enough B and folate  These are probably the segement of 
the population that will have the greatest problem with this nonexistent 
disordercandida blooms after antibiotic therapy

What dosage of B appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper
working of the mucos memebranes


Some of the above material was obtained from Natural Healing by Mark 
Bricklin Published by Rodale press as well as notes from my human 
nutrition course  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in 
the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely 
important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in 
the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida 
blooms  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate 
intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the GI 
system is involved  If candida can not get glucose it's not going to out 
grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and 
fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check 
once carbohydrate is returned to the gut

I'd like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starch


If Steve and some of the other naysayers want to jump all over this post 
fine  I jumped all over Steve in Sci Med Nutrition because he verbably 
accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin 
A and antifungals for a candida bloom in her gut  People seeking advice 
from newsnet should not be treated this way  Those of us giving of our 
time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content  If you saved 
your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly 
seeking help alone I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior 

Brave soul you are  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one
develops an immunity to it  One year ago my phlegmatic self would have
backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis  But my immune
system and my computer system have been hardened from gradual
desensitization  I now kind of like being called anal retentive  it has
a nice ring to it  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the
post  truly classic worthy of a blue or maybe brown ribbon  I might
even crosspost it to altbestofinternet  Hmmm

Anecedotal evidence is worthless  Even doctors who have been using a drug
or treatment for years and who swear it is effective are often suprised
at the results of clinical trials  Whether or not MSG causes describable
reportable documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover  

I tend to disagree I think anecdotal evidence provided there is a lot of it
and it is fairly consistent will is very important  First it points to the
necessity of doing a study and second it at least says that the effects are
all psychological or possibly allergy in this case  As I've pointed out 
before pyschological effects are no less real than other effects  One       
person's makebelieve can easily be another person's reality  Using 
psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example the hallucinations one
person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on
an acid trip there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going
to happen  Anyhow that was a pretty lame example but hopefully I made my
point it's all a matter of perception and as long as someone ingesting MSG
perceives it as causing bad effects then she can definitely experience those
affects  On the other hand it could just be an allergy to the food it's in   or something  Still anecdotal evidence is not worthless it's the stuff that
leads to the study being done

From article Aprvaxoxfordacuk by krishnasvaxoxfordacuk
 The best way of self injection is to use the right size needle
 and choose the correct spot For Streptomycin usually given intra
 muscularly use a thin needle  guage and select a spot on
 the upper outer thigh no major nerves or blood vessels there 
 Clean the area with antiseptic before injection and after Make
 sure to inject deeply a different kind of pain is felt when the
 needle enters the muscle  contrasted to the 'prick' when it 
 pierces the skin
 
 PS Try to go to a doctor Selftreatment and selfinjection should
 be avoided as far as possible
  
The areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little 
fat  I inject on my legs and gut and prefer the gut  I can stick
it in at a  degree angle and barely feel it  I'm not fat just
have a little gut  My legs however are muscular and I have to pinch
to get anything and then I inject at about a  degree angleand it
still hurts  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  
muscular injections howeverso if it's a daily thing it would be
best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey  Although
some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot to prevent 
irritation  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep 
wait for it to dry somewhat or you may get the alcohol in the
puncture and of course that doesn't feel good  A way to prevent
irratation is to mark the spot that you injected  A good way to
do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the 
spot  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot
and spacing the sites out accuartely about    apart

This is from experience so I hope it'll help you  I have
diabetes and have to take an injection every morning

Hi

I've just returned from a visit with my OBGYN and I have a few 
concerns that maybe y'all can help me with  I've been seeing 
her every  weeks for the past few months I'm at week  
and during the last  visits I've gained  to   pounds every 
 weeks  She said this was unacceptable over any  week period 
As it stands I've thus far gained  pounds  Also she says that 
though I'm at  weeks the baby's size is  weeks I think she 
mentioned  inches for the top of the fundus  When I was  
weeks the baby's size was  weeks  I must also add that I had 
an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no 
problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain 
in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and I have a very 
difficult time moving and the doc has recommended I not walk or 
move unless I have to I have a little handicapped sticker for 
when I do need to go out 

Anyway that's  of the situation the other is that almost from 
the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick throwing up about 
 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated  
I told her about this  I know this because I wasn't eating 
very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'  Well 
now I only get sick about once every  weeks and it is still bile 
related  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my 
upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when I 
was lying on my right side  It began to get worse though because 
it started to hurt when I lay on my right side and then it hurt  
no matter what position I was in  Next I noticed that when I 
ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had 
turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse  However if 
I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it 
wasn't as much of a problem

So the doctor says I have cholistatis and that I should avoid 
fatty foods  This makes sense and because I was already aware 
of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have 
been avoiding these foods on my own  But I'm still able to eat 
foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods  

But doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet  This means no meat 
except fish and chicken wo skin I do this anyway  No nuts 
fried food cheese etc  I am allowed skim milk  She said I 
should avoid anything sweet eg bananas  Also I must only 
have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day  
potatoes pasta rice  She said I can't even cook vegetables in 
a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or 
steamed  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have 
some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process  And if 
I'm not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it 
from my stores  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if 
she's concerned about fat  I'm not clear how much of her 
recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on 
cholistatis which I can't seem to find any information on  She 
originally said that I should only gain  pounds during the 
entire pregnancy since I was about  lbs overweight when I 
started  But my sister gained  lbs during her pregnancy and 
she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems  She also 
asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them 
are  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain 
and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet  She did 
want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be 
temporary for that one week 

What I want to know is how reasonable is this nonfat diet  I 
would understand if she had said lowfat diet since I'm trying 
that anyway even if she said really lowfat diet  I think she 
assumes I must be eating a highfat diet but really it is that 
because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to 
use the energy from the food I do eat 

Any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated  I'm 
truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet 
because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few 
minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly  Thus far I 
don't find any foods satisfying

Thanks

English however the terms of medical specialties I was given are in
French  I have no medical dictionary handy mine is a technical
university 

I need to get the translation into English when there is one of the
following words They refer to medical categories of operating rooms
theaters I admit they may not be universally used

If it were my wife I would insist that a radiologist be involved in the
process  Radiologist are intensively trained in the process of
interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that
other physicians aren't aware of  

Maybe maybe not  A new graduate would obviously be well trained but
perhaps without sufficient experience A radiologist trained  or
 years ago who has not kept his continuing education current is a 
whole 'nuther matter  A OB who HAS trained in modern radiology technology
is certainly more qualified than the latter and at least equal to 
the former

Would you want a radiologist to
deliver your baby  If you wouldn't then why would you want a OBGYN to
read your ultrasound study

If the radiologist is also trained in OBGYN why not

 A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohn's
 disease

 But she can't seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
 without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence

 Her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
 problems of people with Crohn's disease 

 I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric

 Thanks in advance
 John Eyles

 All your friend really has to do is find a Registered DieticianRD  While
 most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have RD's who
 are in private practice so to speak  Many physicans will refer their
 patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help  If you can get
 your friend's physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for
 the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist  The
 better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's
 plan doesn't it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to
 control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal
 Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and
 lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but
 I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors  For


If you do a MEDLINE search on turmeric you'll see that it is a potent
lipoxygenase inhibitor which is being investigated in a number of areas
I'm in cardiology and about  years ago the cardiothoracic surgery lab at my
hospital compared the effect of a teaspoon of dissolved turmeric vs a 
bolus of tPA in preventing myocardial reperfusion injury in a perfused
Langendorff sheep heart The turmeric was more effective 


A colleague of mine in the School of Pharmacy Dr Ron Kohen has a paper in
press on the free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activity of tea

 bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects
 are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use  Upjohn is developing
 a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with
 inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet

Hi

I need information on scaring Particularly as a result of grazing the skin
I really wanted to know of 

	 would a scar occur as a result of grazing
	 if yes then would it disappear
	 how long does a graze take to heal
	 will hair grow on it once it has healed
	 what is 'scar tissue'
	 should antiseptic cream be applied to it regularly
	 is it better to keep it exposed and let fresh air at it

Please help  any info  no matter how small will be appreciated greatly 

BUT PLEASE EMAIL ME DIRECTLY because I dont read this newsgroup often this

Summary of thread
A person has Crohns raw vegetables cause problems unspecified
Steve Holland replies  patient may have mild obstruction  Avoid things
that would plug her up  Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general

In article Apraiojscnasagov
spenserfuddjscnasagov S Spenser Aden wrote
 
 Interesting statements simply because I have been told otherwise  I'm
 certainly not questioning Steve's claims as for one I am not a doctor and I
 agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's  But inflammation
 can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food

The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community  The current
feeling
is that inflammation is not induced by food  There is even evidence that
patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation
of
intestinal growth factors  There is now interest in providing small
amounts
of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition  But I digress  
Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food but not inflammation

 Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection is that a good enough
 caveat  I was told that a LOW RESIDUE diet is called for  Basically
 the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut which may not be
 realized by the patient any residue in the system can be caught in the folds
 of inflammation and constantly irritate thus exacerbating the problem
 Therefore anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common
 inflammation should be avoided  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's
 of the terminal ileum my diet should be low residue consisting of

 Completely out  never again  items
 	o corn kernel husk doesn't digest  most of us know this 
 	o popcorn same
 	o dried dehydrated fruit and fruit skins
 	o nuts Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge 

The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions
Again it is not felt that food causes inflammation  These foods are
avoided because they may get stuck  I'd go ahead and have the
fudge though   

 Discouraged greatly
 	o raw vegetables too fibrous
 	o wheat and raw grain breads
 	o exotic lettuce iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water
 	o greens turnip mustard kale etc
 	o little seeds like sesame try getting an Arby's without it
 	o long grain and wild rice husky
 	o beans you'll generate enough gas alone without them
 	o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing
 
 I was told that the more processed the food the better rather ironic in this
 day and age  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE  you want to give your
 system as little chance to inflame as possible  I was told that among the
 NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged I only listed a few to try
 the ones I wanted and see how I felt  If it's bad don't do it again
 Remember though that this was while I was in remission  For Veggies cook the
 daylights out of them  I prefer steaming  I think it's cooks more
 thoroughly  you're mileage may vary
 
 As with anything else CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR  Don't just take my word  But
 this is the info I've been given and it may be a starting point for
 discussion  Good luck
 
Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and
informed patient  Would that many patients be able to tell what
causes them problems  The digestive processing idea is changing but
if a food causes problems avoid them  Be sure that the foods are 
tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause  Crohn's
commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with
severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize

There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed
the issue of dietary restriction of fiber  It would be worth reading
to anyone with an interest in Crohn's

And as I always say when dealing with Crohn's as does Spencer Good Luck

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis  
Previously low residue diets were recommended but this advice has
now changed  Also there will be differences in advice in patients with
and without obstructuon remaining so input by the physician will be 
important  I find the dietician very important in my practice and 
I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing
them since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories
and evaluate the contents of a diet than I do

Jon Noring emits typical NFtype stuff 
 Physicians are just responding in their natural way
 HyperCholeric Syndrome HCS  
 it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of
 physicians will type out as NT 
 One driving characteristic of an NT especially an NTJ is their obvious
 choleric behavior driver type A etc  the extreme emotional need to
 control to lead andor to be the best or the most competent 

Please get it right Jon
This NTJ has a strong desire to correct semantic mistakes
 because the NFs of this world are fouling the oncepristine NT
 intellectual nest with their verbal poop

The dominant correlation is NT  Phlegmatic and not NT  Choleric
One of the semantic roots of choleric is the idea of hot emotional
and one of the semantic roots of phlegmatic is cold unemotional

I suspect that your characterisation of NTs as choleric is what

 Maybe we need more NF doctor's  

Perhaps in serious pediatics and my little boy's got a runny

opthamology urology etc etc  And NFpsychiatry should seperate
from NTie real psychiatry and be given a new name  something

Anecedotal evidence is worthless  Even doctors who have been using a drug
or treatment for years and who swear it is effective are often suprised
at the results of clinical trials  Whether or not MSG causes describable
reportable documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover  

But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal
evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will
NEVER lead anywhere  I'm sure somebody here can provide an example where
anecdotal evidence and the interpretation of it was upheldverified by
followon rigorous clinical trials


I tend to disagree I think anecdotal evidence provided there is a lot of it
and it is fairly consistent will is very important  First it points to the
necessity of doing a study and second it at least says that the effects are
all psychological or possibly allergy in this case  As I've pointed out 
person's makebelieve can easily be another person's reality

Good point  There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to circle
the wagons to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless
maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence
to support controversial subjects such as the yeast hypothesis  But
evidence is evidence  it requires a jury or a process to sort it out and
determine the truth from the junk  Medicine must continue to strive to better
understand the workings of the bodymind for the purpose of alleviating
illness  anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle  it is not
worthless  Rather it can help focus limited resources in the right direction

I got asked in Sci Med Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production
toxic kidney stone formation  I decided to post my answer here as well 
because of the recent question about kidney stones  Not long after I got 
into Sci Med I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium 
would prevent kidney stone formation  I'm going to state it again here
But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B 
supplements  Read on to find out whyI have my asbestos suit on now guys

Vitamin C will form oxalic acid  But large doses are needed above  grams 
per day

	 Review Article Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney 
	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C Int Clin Nutr Rev
	   

But glycine also forms oxalic acidDamino acid oxidases  For both 
glycine and vitamin C one of the best ways to drastically reduce this 
production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine 
but to increase your intake of vitamin B

	 Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in 
	    patients with kidney stones Int Urol Nephrol 
	     to  mg of B each day significasntly decreased the urinary 
	    excretion of oxalate over the  month treatment program

	 The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria Clin Sci 
	     Patients receiving at least mg B each day 
	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels

For gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activityB is 
required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for 
oxidative deaminationDamino acid oxidases  For vitamin C the effect is 
quite different  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism  
The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have  to  
of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid  But this is highly variable 
and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 
 grams per day not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic 
acid  At very high doses of vitamin Cabove  grams per day more of the 
extra vitamin C more than  conversion can end up as oxalic acid  In a 
very early study on vitamin C and oxalic productionProc Soc Exp Biol 
Med  intakes of  grams per day up to  grams per day 
increased the average oxalic acid excretion from mg per day up to mg 
per day  Until  grams per day was reached the average excreted was 
increased by only  to mg per day gram dose  gram dose  gram dose 
and gram dose  grams jumped it to mg over the average excretion 
before supplementation and  grams jumped it to  mg over the average 
before supplementation

B is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body  There 
are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B that we don't know about 
yet  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the 
speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must 
have an enzyme in it that requires B  Differences in B levels could then 
explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C 
challengethis is not the preferred route of catabolism  Increasing your 
intake of B would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you 
take vitamin C supplements  Since the typical American diet is deficient 
in B some researchers believe that the main cause of calciumoxalate 
kidney stones is B deficiencyespecially since so little oxalic acid gets 
absorbed from the gut  Diets providing  to mg of oxalic acid per day 
showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalateUrol Int
  If mg was present each day there was a significant increase 
in urinary oxalate excretion

	Here are the high oxalate foods

	 Beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea
	   Contain at least mggrams

	 Beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale 
	   peanuts pepper sweet potatoe
	   Contain  to  mggrams

If the threshold is mg per day you can see that you really have a lot 
of latitude in food selection  A recent NEngJ Med article also points 
out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your 
intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being 
absorbed at all  If you also increase your intake of B you shouldn't 
have to worry about kidney stones at all The RDA for B is mg per day for 
males and mg per day for femalesdirectly related to protein intake
B can be toxicnerve damage if it is consumed in doses of mg or more 
per day for an extended peroidweeks to months  

The USDA food survey done in  had an average intake of  mg per day 
for males and mg per day for females living in the US  Coupled with 
this low intake was a high protein dietwhich greatly increases the B 
requirement as well as the presence of some of the  different drugs that 
either block B absorption are metabolic antagonists of B or promote B 
excretion in the urine  Common ones are birth control pills alcohol
isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids  I tell my students to 
supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that 
increase the B requirement  The dose recommended for patients taking 
birth control pills is mg per day and this should work for most of the 
other drugs that increase the B requirementthis would be on top of your 
dietary intake of B  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone 
formation should be given B supplements

One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your 
CaMg dietary ratio is   Magnesiumoxalate is much more soluble than is 
calciumoxalate

	 The magnesiumcalcium ratio in the concentrated urines of 
patients with calcium oxalate calculiInvest Urol 

	 Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the 
crystallization of calcium in urine changes producted by foodmagnesium 
interactionJ Urol 

	Review Article Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment 
of renal calcium stones J Presse Med 

There are actually about three times as many articles published in the 
medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone 
formation than there are for B  I thought that I was being pretty safe in 
stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier 
post in this news group but good old John A in Mass jumped all over me I 
guess that he doesn't read the medical literature  Oh well since kidney 
stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them I thought 
I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office

Would anyone out there in 'netland' happen to have an
authentic surefire way of making this great sauce that
is used to adorn Gyro's and Souvlaki

I'm not sure of the exact recipe but I'm sure acidophilus is one of
the major ingredients   


The only recipies I've ever seen for this include plain yogurt finely
chopped cucumber and a couple of crushed cloves of garlic  yummy

Hate to wreck your elaborate theory but Steve Dyer is not an MD
So professional jealosy over doctors who help their patients with
Nystatin etc can't very well come into the picture  Steve
doesn't have any patients



response to specificially Candida albicans and I showed a strong positive
Another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test
is essentially useless  And assuming it is true that Candida can grow

Yes everyone who is normal does that  We use candida on the other arm
when we put a tuberculin test on  If people don't react to candida
we assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not
react to anything  All normal people have antibodies to candida
If not you would quickly turn into a fungus ball

This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny
and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the
appropriate studies are done  And that is if you can't observe or culture
the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there's no way to diagnose or
even recognize the disease  And I know they realize that it is virtually
impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot
be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body

It's a real Catch


You've just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory
Find something that no one can disprove and then write a book saying
it is the cause of whatever  Since no one can disprove it you can
rake in the bucks for quite some time  

I have often wondered what an MD with chronic 
GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
patients is a nonexistent syndrome


That is odd isn't it  Why do you suppose it is that MDs with these
common problems don't go for these crazy ideas  Does the professional
jealosy extend to suffering in silence even though they know they
could be cured if they just followed this quack book

Okay this is a long shot

My friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosistype symptoms very  
regularly  This has been going on for a number of years  She's seen a  
number of doctors six was the last count I think  Most of them have  
said either You have mono or You're full of it there's nothing wrong  
with you  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her  
and one has claimed that it is EpsteinBarr syndrome

Now what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that  
it exists  Obviously this has been her experience  So what's the  
story  Is it real  Does the medical profession believe it to be real

Has anyone had success is treating EBS  Or is it just something to live

Also True


 Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in

Not really  

Kirlian photography is taking pictures of the corona discharge from
objects animate or inanimate  The fields applied to the objects are
millions of times larger than any biologically created fields  If you
want to record the biologically created electric fields you've got to
use lownoise highgain sensors typical of EEGs and EKGs  Kirlian
photography is just phunwithphysics type stuff right up there with
soaking chunks of extrafine steel wool in liquid oxygen then hitting

dangerous

 Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in

	Is it that serious  My EKG often comes back with a few irregular

The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal
heart rhythms cardiac dysrhythmias  Some of them are very serious
while others are completely benign  Having a few irregular beats
on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and
when they occurred or could be of no significance

Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying
heart disease to develop arrhythmias  Very low potassium levels are
clearly dangerous but it is not clear how much of a problem
lowendofnormal levels are  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat
anyone with even a mildly lownormal potassium level

One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the
relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty
acids FAs

I was diagnosed last May wCrohn's of the terminal ileum When I got
out of the hospital I read up on it a bit and came across several
studies investigating the role of EPA an essentially FA in reducing
inflammation The evidence was mixed Many of these studies are
discussed in Inflammatory Bowel Disease MacDermott Stenson 

But if I recall correctly there were some methodological bones to be
picked with the studies both the ones wpos and wneg results In
the studies patients were given EPA a few gramsday for most of the
studies but if I recall correctly there was no restriction of the
other FAs that the patients could consume From the informed
layperson's perspective this seems mistaken If lots of n FAs are
consumed along with the EPA then the ratio of bad prostanoid
products to good prostanoid products could still be fairly bad
Isn't this ratio the issue

What's the view of the gastro community on EPA these days EPA
supplements along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs
appear to have helped me significantly though it could just be the
low absolute amount of fat I eat   calories

Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association  I posted a
message like this a few months ago and received no replies but here it
is again

Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and
seizures  This would allow us to hold discussions and share
information via electronic mail  I already run a Listserver for two
other groups so the mechanics would be easy

If you are interested mail me a note  If I get enough replies I will
make it happen and provide you with the details

BTW I have also started a database on Epilepsy  This is part of my
research on natural language question answering systems  Users of this
service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program
searches the database and retrieves its best response  The technology
works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have
been seen before  All new questions that are not answered are recorded
and used to improve the system

This database is still small and sparse but we are adding new
information  To try it out do the following

	telnet debradgbtdocca
	login chat

	Then select the Epilepsy item from the menu of databases

Outbreaks of a chronicmonolike entity were originally called EBS or
some variant thereof because most of the people with this disease had
elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus But not all of them
did which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal
Medicine Jan  I believe Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue
and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome CFIDS since it seems clear that
some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs

Astonishly there are still docs who tell people with massively
swollen glands recurrent fevers and nightsweats etc that there's
nothing wrong with them This is not the same thing as saying that the
syndrome may have a at least partly psychological cause The
disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers
on just what the cause is No one knows but theories include
psychological stress some sort of virus a retrovirus say most 
maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses environmental
toxins bacteria and yes candida genes andor some combo of
these

There's no outright cure at the moment but different docs try
different things some of which seem to help

Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days
Post your Q to altmedcfs and you will be flooded wfacts

Note There are lots of far better understood and better treatable
diseases that look like CFIDS Make sure these get ruledout by a good
doc

Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year  It is still
partially frozen and I am still in physical therapy every week  But the
pain has subsided almost completely  UNTIL last week when I mowed the
lawn for twenty minutes each two days in a row  I have a push type power
mower  The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite
a while and I used ice and medicine again  Can anybody explain why this
particular activity which does not seem to stress me very much generally
should cause this shoulder problem

I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the Yeast Connection
that there is indeed work by researchers to do this  Of course they are
working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus
membrane tissue with associated mild inflammatory response can and does
occur in a large number of people  If you reject this yeast hypothesis
then I'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic

I don't like the term quack being applied to a licensed physician David
Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethicalin my opinion
I'll give you some examples

	 Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no 
	   demonstrated needother than a drug addition for the medication

	 Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid 
	   function for the purpose of quick weight loss

	 Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has 
	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerouscyanide release by 
	   the NCI

These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should 
not committ but sometimes do  There are also errors of omissionsome of 
which result in malpractice suits  I don't think that using antifungal 
agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be 
having a problem with candidaor another fungal growth is an error of 
commission or omission  Healers have had a long history of trying to 
relieve human suffering  Some have stuck to standard approved procedures
others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a 
chance that it will help the patient  The key has to be tied to the 
healer's oath I will do no harm  But you know David that very few 
treatments involve no risk to the patient  The job of the physician is a 
very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed  Each 
physician deals with this riskbenefit paradox a little differently  Some 
are very conservative while others are more agressive  An agressive 
approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long 
as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake 
in lots of moneythrough some of the schemes that have been uncovered in 
the medicare fraud cases I don't see the need to label these healers as 
quacks or even unethical

What do I reserve the term quack for  Pseudomedical professionals  
These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the 
frustrated patient to fall into their lair  Some of these individuals are 
really doing a pretty good job of providing alternative medicine  But 
many lack any formal training and are in the business simply to make a 
few fast bucks   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting 
competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted this alternative 
care area is really a buyer's beware arena  If you are lucky you may find 
someone who can help you  If you are unlucky you can loose a lot of 
money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo
medical professional to diagnose diseasewhich is the fortay of the 
liscened physicians

I hope that this clears things up David

 One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the
 relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty
 acids FAs
 
 I was diagnosed last May wCrohn's of the terminal ileum When I got
 out of the hospital I read up on it a bit and came across several
 studies investigating the role of EPA an essentially FA in reducing
 inflammation The evidence was mixed Many of these studies are
 discussed in Inflammatory Bowel Disease MacDermott Stenson 
 
 But if I recall correctly there were some methodological bones to be
 picked with the studies both the ones wpos and wneg results In
 the studies patients were given EPA a few gramsday for most of the
 studies but if I recall correctly there was no restriction of the
 other FAs that the patients could consume From the informed
 layperson's perspective this seems mistaken If lots of n FAs are
 consumed along with the EPA then the ratio of bad prostanoid
 products to good prostanoid products could still be fairly bad
 Isn't this ratio the issue
 
 What's the view of the gastro community on EPA these days EPA
 supplements along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs
 appear to have helped me significantly though it could just be the
 low absolute amount of fat I eat   calories
 
 Brian bmdelanemidwayuchicagoedu

As you note the research is mixed so there is no consensus on the
role of fatty acids in Ulcerative colitis  There is a role for short
chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches
that are inflammed Short is butyrate and shorter  There may be a role
for treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids and I am looking 
forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are
doing  

You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other
fatty acids  You should contact the authors directly about that or
even write a letter to the editor  it is a good point  By the way
the abbreviation EPA is not in general use so I do not know what 
fatty acid you are speaking about

And to Brian an U of C   There is a physician named Stephen Hanauer
there who is a recognized expert in the treatment of IBD  You might 
give him a call  He is interested in new combinations of drugs for 
the treatment of IBD  If you call please say hello to him from me
I was looking at U of C for a position and perhaps still am  And
be sure to look into joining the CCFA

Best of Luck

 Nobody is saying that you shouldn't be allowed to use msg  Just
don't force it on others If you have food that you want to 
enhance with msg just put the MSG on the table like salt  It is
then the option of the eater to use it  If you make a commerical
product just leave it out You can include a packet like some

Salt pepper mustard ketchup pickles  are table options
Treat MSG the same way  I wouldn't shove my condiments down your

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors of
the squeakyclean traditional crewcut talk to the AMA before starting
any treatment kind who recommend treatments that though accepted may
not be necessary for the patient at the time  And all for making a quick
buck  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the US is
significantly inflated by these quacks of a different color  In fact I'd
say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the
true focus of the medical profession  The AMA and the Boards should focus
on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'searchand
destroymissions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non
traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
that traditionalaccepted medicine cannot help



Now to make a general comment on many recent posts


Lately I've seen the word quack bandied about recklessly  When a doctor or
doctorwannabe has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical
subject in a civilized manner all heshe has to do is say quackquack and
somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over
on their backs and peepee on themselves in obedience  What do they teach
you in medical school  how to throw your authority around

Let me put it another way to make my point clear  quack is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand
The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency  and coming
from any medical doctor or wannabe where competency is expected is real
scary

But what do I know I've already been diagnosed by the scimedgods in this
newsgroup as being 'anal retentive' and 'psychotic'  I look forward to more
netdiagnoses  Hey they're free


Jon Quacks 'R Us Noring


ps may I suggest  seriously  that if the doctors and wannabedoctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group
You can call it scimedtraditionalmoderated or scimedAMAapproved so you
can keep analretentives like me out of it

I am writing this to find out the following

	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis

	The names of a doctors who specialize in such surgery

	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer

My boyfriend age  and otherwise in good health was diagnosed with 
reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about  years ago  At that time he 
saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers Mylanta 
Tagamet as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed  
These treatments were not effective and because the damage was 
worsening he opted for a surgical repair  months ago  He was told 
there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem a Nissen 
wrap and a Hill Repair  He opted for the Hill Repair He recovered 
very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse 
and in addition he now has trouble swallowing including saliva

The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him 
that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a precancerous condition 
which he called Barrett's Syndrome If he can't avoid having reflux will 
he necessarily get cancer

Basically if anyone has any information on what he should do now I'd 
appreciate it

Thanks

rousseauaimmunexcom writes about heat shock proteins HSP's and DNA

I hate to be derogatory but in this case I think it's warranted

HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress  The only reason they
are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated
using heat shock  Dead tissue ie meat is not going to produce ANY
protein because it's DEAD  

Also who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated  It will be 
completely digested in your stomach which is about pH   

Some of you worry WAY too much  Eat a healthy balanced diet and relax

My advice is if you don't know what you are talking about it is better
to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your
ignorance  Don't speculate or at least get some concrete information
before you do

I recall reading somewhere during my youth in some science popularization
book that whyle isotope changes don't normally affect chemistry a consumption
of only heavy water would be fatal and that seeds watered only with heavy
water do not sprout  Does anyone know about this


I also heard this I always thought it might make a good eposide of
'Columbo' for someone to be poisoned with heavy water  it wouldn't
show up in any chemical test

No one else seems to know so I'll post this

This topic came up on sciphysicsfusion shortly after the coldfusion
flap started  As I recall its been done to some experimental mice
They showed various ill effects and eventually died  The reason is
that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as
hydrogen due to its extra mass which causes lower velocity Boltzman
constant mumble  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out
of kilter and you get sick and die

I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way in or out of real
life  The process takes quite a while  If anyone wants to write this
book I would imagine you would have to

 Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy
   water

 Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other
   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium

During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and
eventually die but I imagine it would take weeks during which the
poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the
water the victim ingested was heavy

You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both
alarmed and confused  Why should every organ in the body suddenly
begin to deteriorate  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the
heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real
story here

Come to think of it  would continue even after the heavy water was
no longer being ingested so hospitalisation might be too late

The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids
would literally be heavy  Water has a molecular weight of  and
heavy water has a MW of   Thus the victim's weight will increase by
about  for every  of body water replaced by heavy water  Maybe
the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that
the victim's urine is strangely dense  Is there any medical test
involving the specific gravity of a body fluid

Hi

I've just returned from a visit with my OBGYN and I have a few 
concerns that maybe y'all can help me with  I've been seeing 
her every  weeks for the past few months I'm at week  
and during the last  visits I've gained  to   pounds every 
 weeks  She said this was unacceptable over any  week period 
As it stands I've thus far gained  pounds  Also she says that 
though I'm at  weeks the baby's size is  weeks I think she 
mentioned  inches for the top of the fundus  When I was  
weeks the baby's size was  weeks  I must also add that I had 
an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no 
problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain 
in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and I have a very 
difficult time moving and the doc has recommended I not walk or 
move unless I have to I have a little handicapped sticker for 
when I do need to go out 

Anyway that's  of the situation the other is that almost from 
the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick throwing up about 
 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated  
I told her about this  I know this because I wasn't eating 
very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'  Well 
now I only get sick about once every  weeks and it is still bile 
related  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my 
upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when I 
was lying on my right side  It began to get worse though because 
it started to hurt when I lay on my right side and then it hurt  
no matter what position I was in  Next I noticed that when I 
ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had 
turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse  However if 
I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it 
wasn't as much of a problem

So the doctor says I have cholistatis and that I should avoid 
fatty foods  This makes sense and because I was already aware 
of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have 
been avoiding these foods on my own  But I'm still able to eat 
foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods  

But doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet  This means no meat 
except fish and chicken wo skin I do this anyway  No nuts 
fried food cheese etc  I am allowed skim milk  She said I 
should avoid anything sweet eg bananas  Also I must only 
have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day  
potatoes pasta rice  She said I can't even cook vegetables in 
a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or 
steamed  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have 
some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process  And if 
I'm not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it 
from my stores  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if 
she's concerned about fat  I'm not clear how much of her 
recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on 
cholistatis which I can't seem to find any information on  She 
originally said that I should only gain  pounds during the 
entire pregnancy since I was about  lbs overweight when I 
started  But my sister gained  lbs during her pregnancy and 
she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems  She also 
asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them 
are  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain 
and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet  She did 
want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be 
temporary for that one week 

What I want to know is how reasonable is this nonfat diet  I 
would understand if she had said lowfat diet since I'm trying 
that anyway even if she said really lowfat diet  I think she 
assumes I must be eating a highfat diet but really it is that 
because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to 
use the energy from the food I do eat 

Any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated  I'm 
truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet 
because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few 
minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly  Thus far I 
don't find any foods satisfying

Thanks 

G

For one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet If it
changes anything 

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories Where before you
had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave
cooked  Smaller meals but more of them Not terrific amounts of meat it's
hard to digest anyway 

For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or
rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn Maybe
smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area Is the
baby still coming up Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs How
tight are your clothes You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses 
your middle Be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it
will put pressure on the digestive tract 

Try laying on your sides back
and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive
Easier on your legs circulation as well You might try letting the baby
turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months
When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the
diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles If I had my
second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he
didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous


Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe
she just nags all her patients this way Especially if she's young 
But this gallbladderwhatever problem that might be coming up is something
to be avoided if possible 

Nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy My
first pregnancy was miserable During the second I had very little trouble
Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better
chance of carrying their baby grain of salt here 

Good luck

Jackie

Yes there is such a thing as eye dominance although I am not sure if
this dominance refers to perscription strength

As i recall if you selectively close your dominant eye you will percieve
that the image shifts This will not happen if you close your other eye

I believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness but I
can't recall the relation at the moment

poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did

David Rind

Sure there are quacks There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who
treat One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly 
There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks Smart quacks and dumb ones 

There are people ahead of their time with unprobable or unproven theories
and rationals There are illreasoned absurd theorists 

Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who  

Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors
quacks in Babylon 

Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers Plenty of illnesses
aren't or can't be diagnosed or treated But I think it's better to argue
against the theory as was originally done with postings on candida a month
or so ago Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an
opinion about someone's competency And you can't convince everybody 

Sometimes a correct diagnosis
takes years for people they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the
disease they haven't developed something recognizable yet or they have
something that no one is going to recognize because it hasn't been
described yet Sometimes they get a cure sometimes the illness wears out
sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment
sometimes they find it's incurable  

There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an 
illness Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is

Do you believe that any quacks exist  How about quack diagnoses  Is
being a licensed physician enough to guarantee that someone is not
a quack or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack
other people shouldn't say so

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors of
the squeakyclean traditional crewcut talk to the AMA before starting
any treatment kind

Umm weren't you the one objecting to someone who is a licensed
physician being called a quack  Or is it just that being a licensed
physician is a good defense against charges of quackery when the
physician agrees with your system of beliefs

Lately I've seen the word quack bandied about recklessly

Actually I almost never use the term quack  When I discuss
systemic yeast syndrome however I always point out that
mainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis and I agree
with that characterization

Let me put it another way to make my point clear  quack is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision

Really  I bet virtually everyone reading these posts understands what
Steve Dyer Gordon Banks and I am implying when we have talked about
systemic yeast syndrome as a quack diagnosis  Would you prefer the
word charlatan  I don't happen to think that all quacks are
charlatans since I suspect that some believe in the diseases they
are diagnosing

ps may I suggest  seriously  that if the doctors and wannabedoctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group

Why  Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out
in SCImed that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the 
existence of systemic yeast syndrome

My wife's obgyn has an ultrasound machine in her office  When

On her next visit my wife asked another doctor in the office if
they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist
read the pictures  The doctor very vehemently insisted that they
were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT

My wife is concerned about this  She saw a TV show a couple months
back something like  or Dateline NBC etc where an expert
on fetal ultrasounds a radiologist was showing all the different
deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound

Should my wife be concerned  Should we take the pictures to a 
radiologist for a second opinion and if so where would we find
such an expert in Chicago  We don't really have any special medical
reason to be concerned but if a radiologist will be able to see
things the obgyn can't then I don't see why we shouldn't use one

Any thoughts

 As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms
and is expirienced its use and interpretation he should be just as
capable of reading it as any radiologist All doctors are qualified to
read xrays us ct scans etc it is just that a radiologist does nothing
else and thus is only better at reading them because of all this time
spent doing this skill in reading xrays etc just comes from plenty of
practice If your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he
should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by
this technique

Why  Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out

I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist
No scientist would take your statement  no convincing empirical evidence
to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome  to tell you
anything except an absence of data on the question  Noring has pointed out
the catch that if the crazy theory were true you probably couldn't
find any direct evidence of it  that you couldn't observe those yeastie
beasties with present methods even if they were there  Noring and the
fellow from Oklahoma sorry forgot your name have also suggested one set
of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences 
namely that when people with certain conditions are given antifungals
many of them appear to get better  

So if you have any evidence against the hypothesis  for example
controlled doubleblind studies showing that the antifungals don't do any
better than sugar water  then let's hear it  If you don't then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject
disbelief on the other  In which case please there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative  

And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of
people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything
in sight making wild claims with no evidence and always refusing to do
controlled studies  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently
sincere experiences of the people on the net observing antifungals working
on themselves and other people in certain specific cases  There are also
quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase in spite of the fact that it's
completely broken down in the guts but this doesn't change the genuine
scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting
oxidative damage  Same thing  Just cause there are candida quacks that
doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis  If there's some
other reason besides the quacks if only anecdotal to think it could be
true then that is what has to be considered that is what the net people
have been talking about

But again there is no point in arguing about it  There is anecdotal
evidence and there is no convincing evidence and there are also some
candida quacks out there I hope everyone can agree on all of that  Thus
it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled doubleblind
study of antifungals or else forget convincing anybody else to carry out
the test just carry it out themselves  and also whether they can
adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis

   Is there a righteye dominance eyedness as there is an
   overall righthandedness in the population I mean do most
   people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the
   other If so what kinds of percentages can be attached to this
   Thanks 


Yes there is such a thing as eye dominance although I am not sure if
this dominance refers to perscription strength

As i recall if you selectively close your dominant eye you will percieve
that the image shifts This will not happen if you close your other eye

I believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness but I
can't recall the relation at the moment

Barry D Benowitz

I read a great book about eye dominance several years ago So there is one
book out thereat least one 

There were several types of eye dominance Where a person looks in their
memory usually indicates a type of eye dominanc Another type is related to
coordination activities like hitting a ball Another for reading 

I didn't read one that discussed prescription strength Although people
with bad vision near or far sighted would tend to depend on the stronger
eye

	My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's
syndrome Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome

	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine  treatment for
hyperthyroidism She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the
hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion
from it 

	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level
but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist Her previous
endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital She entered the
hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms skin lesions

I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an
abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets  

I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia

I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel
to New York City For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology

Any information that might help Apparently there hasn't been much
improvement in her condition over the past several months

If you think you have kidney stones or your doctor tells you that you do
DEFINITELY follow up on it  My sister was diagnosed with kidney stones
  years ago and given medication to take to dissolve them  After that
failed and she continued to be in great pain they decided she had
endometriosis  When they did exploratory surgery they discovered she
had a tumor which turned out to be rhabdomyosarcoma  a very rare

SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL
 
    By Laura Pitter
    TUZLA Bosnia Reuter  Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist
when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim
town of Srebrenica last August
    But after treating  mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody
war he considers himself a surgeon
    Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no
license to practice But if I operate on a person and he lives
normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have''
    Evacuated by the UN this week to his home town of Tuzla
the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of
the horrors of the yearlong Serb siege of Srebrenica and the
suffering of the thousands trapped there
    I lived through hell together with the people of
Srebrenica All those who lived through this are the greatest
heroes that humanity can produce'' he told reporters
    Mujanovic  had practiced for two months as an assistant
at a local hospital in Tuzla but before going to Srebrenica he
had never performed a surgical operation on his own Now he says
he has performed major surgery  times relying on books for
guidance amputating arms and legs  times usually without
anesthetic delivering  babies and performing four cesarean
sections
    He worked tohour days slept in the hospital for the
first  weeks after his arrival last Aug  and treated  
patients
    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from
Tuzla  miles northwest of Srebrenica About  other people
carried in supplies and  soldiers guided and protected him
through guerrilla terrain he said
    His worst memory was of  days ago when seven Serb shells
landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football
field killing  people immediately and wounding  Half of
the dead were women and children
    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the
children were playing soccer There was no warning  the
blood flowed like a river in the street'' he said
    There were pieces of women all around and you could not
piece them together One woman holding her two children in her
hands was lying with them on the ground dead They had no
heads''
    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were
deplorable he said Many deaths could have been prevented had
the hospital had surgical tools facilities and medicine
    The six general practitioners who had been operating before
he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did They
didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs''
    Once he arrived the situation improved he said but by
midSeptember he had run out of supplies
    Bandages were washed and boiled five times  sometimes
they were falling apart in my hands'' he said Doctors had no
anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain
because it increased bleeding
    People were completely conscious during amputations and
stomach operations'' he said Blood transfusions were
impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types
    I felt destroyed psychologically'' Mujanovic said
    The situation improved after Dec  when a convoy arrived
from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres
    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in
midDecember after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the
region Every day we had air strikes and shellings''
    Then the hunger set in
    Between midDecember and midMarch when US planes began
air dropping food between  and  people were dying every day
from complications associated with malnutrition he said
    I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the
people from massive death by hunger and starvation'' he said
    According to Mujanovic around  people died in
Srebrenica  of them children during a year of siege
    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after
visiting his wife who is ill in Tuzla
    They say I'm a hero'' he said There were thousands of
people standing at the sides of the road crying and waving when
I left And I cried too''

   Of course they are working on the theory that candida
 overbloom with penetration into mucus membrane tissue with
 associated mild inflammatory response can and does occur 
 in a large number of people  If you reject this yeast 
 hypothesis then I'd guess you'd view this research as one
 more wasteful and quixotic endeavor  Stay tuned

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections  I can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms
To understand this skepticism one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection  There have been quite a few and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical

On the other hand I am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility spurred by
suggestive clinical experience to research it further  The
doubters may be surprised  It has happened before

I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
another  And indeed perhaps some of them do know  I am the
one who is currently ignorant  But I find this the most honest
route and so I am happy with it

Do you believe that any quacks exist  How about quack diagnoses  Is

true focus of the medical profession  The AMA and the Boards should focus
on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'searchand
destroymissions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non
traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
that traditionalaccepted medicine cannot help

If I prescribe itraconazole for a patient's sinusitis neither the AMA
FDA State Licensing Board nor ABFP will be knocking on my door to ask
why  This is a specious argument

on their backs and peepee on themselves in obedience  What do they teach
you in medical school  how to throw your authority around

Among other things how to evaluate new theories and treatments

Let me put it another way to make my point clear  quack is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand

Funny I thought it meant one who fraudulently misrepresents his
ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or
the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers Dorland's
th  Certainly more precision than conveyed by chronic yeast

The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency  and coming
from any medical doctor or wannabe where competency is expected is real
scary

The inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous
representations is far more frightening  It is fraud to promote a
treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it
and the quacksalver knows so or error if the honest practitioner
doesn't know so  Failure to speak out against either bespeaks
incompetency

ps may I suggest  seriously  that if the doctors and wannabedoctors on 
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and 
theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group

May I reply  seriously  that if the practitioners and proponents of
nonscientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts
of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out they should
learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing
hierarchy and divisions

In article AAseastarseashell bebmzasruchvpkhchevroncom Beverly M Zalan writes

My  year son is so plagued  Lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems 
to keep it under control  But let him get bopped there and he'll recur for 
days  Also allergies colds dry air all seem to contribute  But again the 
vaseline or AD ointment or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring

If you can get it you might want to try a Canadian overthecounter product
called Secaris which is a watersoluble gel  Compared to Vaseline or other
greasy ointments Secaris seems more compatible with the moisture that's
already there


Secaris is reasonably inexpensive  Cdn for a tube and is indeed an
over the counter medication Why it does not appear to be available in the
US I don't know It's manufactured in Montreal

It's a nasal lubricant and is intended to help nosebleeds that result from
dry mucous membranes

From some of the replies to my original posting it's evident that some
people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected
from environmental influences ie dry air But I've had no responses
from anyone with experience with Rutin Is there another newsgroup that
might have specifics on herbal remedies

But thanks to all those who did reply with their experiences

 is used to adorn Gyro's and Souvlaki
 
 I'm not sure of the exact recipe but I'm sure acidophilus is one of
 the major ingredients   

It's plain yoghurt with grated cucumber and coriander other spices are
sometimes used Some people use half yoghurt and half mayonaise

In the kind I have made I used a Lite sour cream instead of yogurt  May not
be as good for you but I prefer the taste  A few small bits of cuke in
addition to the grated cuke may also finish the sauce off nicely

by any available data  Hopefully as a scientist you would
take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based
upon their data

 beasties with present methods even if they were there  Noring and the
 fellow from Oklahoma sorry forgot your name have also suggested one set
 of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences 
 namely that when people with certain conditions are given antifungals
 many of them appear to get better  
Gee I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about
myself my friends and my family but in the practice of
medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for
basing therapy than Aunt Susie's brotherinlaw 

Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis
but rarely proves anything in a positive sense  And unlike
mathematics boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical
issues and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually
disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease

 So if you have any evidence against the hypothesis  for example
 controlled doubleblind studies showing that the antifungals don't do any
 better than sugar water  then let's hear it  If you don't then what we
 have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject
 disbelief on the other  In which case please there is no point in yelling
 back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
 convincing evidence either positive or negative  
I would characterize it not as 'abject disbelief' but rather 
'scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions'

 it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
 marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
 manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled doubleblind
 study of antifungals or else forget convincing anybody else to carry out
 the test just carry it out themselves  and also whether they can
 adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
 should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis
I have no problem with such an approach but this is NOT what
is happening in the 'trenches' of this diagnosis

Putting aside our substantial differences I'd like to ask the knowledgeable
ones to give feedback on this  Let me explain

One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after
having some difficulties with walking and writing she is  years old
Otherwise she is in fine health  The discovery was made via CAT scans

She then had MRI scans done where small cancerous areas were discovered
in her lungs  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma  One spot is
in the lungs and another in the pneumothorax  The oncologists believe
the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor she smoked
until four years ago

Anyway I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is how it is different
from other cancers how she will be treated luckily the tumor is right
below the skull and can be easily removed and statistically what are
the chances for full remissionrecovery

Thanks

Hi

it started to hurt when I lay on my right side and then it hurt  
no matter what position I was in  Next I noticed that when I 
ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had 
turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse  However if 
I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it 
wasn't as much of a problem

So the doctor says I have cholistatis and that I should avoid 
fatty foods  This makes sense and because I was already aware 
of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have 
been avoiding these foods on my own  But I'm still able to eat 
foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods  

But doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet  This means no meat 
except fish and chicken wo skin I do this anyway  No nuts 
fried food cheese etc  I am allowed skim milk  She said I 
should avoid anything sweet eg bananas  Also I must only 
have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day  
potatoes pasta rice  She said I can't even cook vegetables in 
a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or 
steamed  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have 
some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process  And if 

G

For one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet If it
changes anything 

You can live on the diet but you need to up your nonfat calories Where
before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave
cooked  Smaller meals but more of them Not terrific amounts of meat it's
hard to digest anyway First even fish fowl and breads have fat Second
the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them Third your
body like most peoples wasn't bred to live on a high fat modern diet
If you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about
the luxury of eating fat how people enjoyed it This was because it was so
rare Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that
they do now  

For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or
rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn Maybe
smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area Is the
baby still coming up Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs How
tight are your clothes You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses 
your middle Be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it
will put pressure on the digestive tract 

Try laying on your sides back
and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive
Easier on your legs circulation as well You might try letting the baby
turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months
When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the
diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles If I had my
second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he
didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous


Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe
she just nags all her patients this way Especially if she's young  
But this gallbladderwhatever problem that might be coming up is something
to be avoided if possible You don't want to become ill with it while you
are pregnant If you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the
baby It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest
of the population a good part of it is that they are willing to do the
dieting etc that helps them avoid surgery Also I don't think the surgery
lets a person go back to eating a high fat diet  

Nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy My
first pregnancy was miserable During the second I had very little trouble
Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better
chance of carrying their baby grain of salt here 

Good luck

Jackie

 As a person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids are
 too I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE FOOD INDUSTRY WANTS TO PUT MSG IN FOOD

Some people think it enhances the flavor  I personally don't think it
helps the taste it makes me sick so I try to avoid it

 From dyerspdcccom Steve Dyer writes

 Sez you  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any
 controlled studies  Infant mice and other models are useful as far
 as they go but they're not relevant to the matter at hand  Which is
 not to say that I favor its use in things like baby fooda patently
 ridiculous use of the additive  But we have no reason to believe
 that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely

Well I know that MSG effects ME adversely  maybe not permanently but
at least temporarily enough that I like to try to avoid the stuff

 From kiranvillagecom Kiran Wagle Writes

 If you don't like additives then for godsake 
 get off the net and learn to cook from scratch  Sheesh

EXCUSE ME

Why can't people learn to cook from scratch ON the net  I've gotten
LOTS of recipes off the net that don't use additives

If you LIKE additives then get off the net and go to your local
supermarket buy lots of packaged foods and YOU get OFF THE NET

 IS IT TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT THE RECIPES ARE NOT VERY GOOD 
 OR THE FOOD IS POOR QUALITY
 
 Yes and YOU buy it  Says something about your taste eh

I don't

 
 And what happens when the companies forced to submit to your silly notions
 go out of business because nobody wants to buy their overpriced bad food 
 Removing preservatives directly raises food costs by reducing shelf life

HEY  I'll pay MY hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more
but does NOT have preservatives  I choose to speak with my pocketbook
in many ways

 From kiranvillagecom Kiran Wagle

 You have a good point  MSG is commonly used in soups in bottled
 sauces in seasoning mixtures and in the coating on barbecue potato
 chips  

Nacho cheese Doritos breading for MANY frozen fried foods like fish
and chicken etc ad naseum

 If MSG is really the problem we should call this barbecue potato
 chip syndrome or maybe diner syndrome   

Or the and other natural flavorings syndrome  It's been a few years
since I've bought anything labelled with and other natural
flavorings  

 From kiranvillagecom Kiran Wagle

 THE REACTION CAME THE TIME THE MSG WAS IN THE FOOD
 THAT WAS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
 SAME RESTAURANT  SAME INGREDIENTS
 
 How do you know this
 
 In order to demonstrate your claim you would have had to supervise the
 preparation on both occasions  Perhaps they used MSG both times and lied
 about it  Perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil and
 produced some bizarre toxin that you're allergic to 

Well I had had similar reactions many times  That was when I really
started WATCHING CAREFULLY  reaction to Doritos  hey guess what's in
there  reaction to Lawry's season salt  guess what's in THERE

I'll give you a hint  I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY
different products with MSG that I figured out one thing

UNLESS I plan on getting sick  I won't eat the stuff without my
Seldane  And did I ever learn to read labels

 PLEASE note that I am NOT saying you are making it up I am just
 trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it
 might seem  

Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick  And EVERY
time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products
And consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge
 it might not please a medical researcher  but it pleased my own
personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST
IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it and enough proof
that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw
out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg 
and he always flinches when there's waste  but it was a simple
explanation  I won't eat this stuff I WON'T cook with this stuff so
I can either throw it out or give it away

 From patteeucsuColoradoEDU Donna Pattee

 My guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained MSG 

Probably Lawry's seasoning salt  I LOVE the way that tastes  

I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG  I've noticed that I
have a certain tolerance level  like a small bag of bbq chips once
a month or so it not a problem  but that same bag of chips will
bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of
the Chinese restaurants the day before  

 From kelleyhealthyuwaterlooca Catherine L Kelley
 

 All that's needed now is that final step a doubleblind study done
 on humans  There isn't even an ethical question about possible
 harm as this is a widely used and approved food additive

But  some say that only  of the population has a problem with MSG 
some say it's more like   but let's say that it's   How many
people would have to be tested that would have a problem  Also  I
KNOW I have a problem with it and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test
Like thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick  Also  I'm sure that
most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at
different times  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the
reaction than when I'm healthy as proven today  when I'm stuffy but
for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ
chips 

 From kiranvillagecom Kiran Wagle

 Because too many of you generic rhetorical 'you' not 'you Cathy' go
 around calling this Chinese restaurant syndrome thus suggesting to the
 people you complain to that you experience this ONLY from Chinese food 
 MSG is prevalent in a LOT more things than Chinese foodthats why I
 suggested calling this Diner syndrome  

Cathy doesn't  I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it
chinese restaurant syndrome and I NEVER stated I got it only from
Chinese food  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my
personal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold or
not hold the MSG  I can't call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them
to make me ONE back of chips without MSG

 On the other hand if one complains about potatoes from a mix or
 restaurant spice mixes I'm going to believe them and if anyone says they
 got MSGsick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party I'm
 REALLY going to believe them  

Well I believe I mentioned that in an earlier post

 Has anyone had an MSG reaction from something other than a
 Chinese restaurant  

 LOTS of times  that's why it was so hard for me to pin down  I
 would probably have been EASIER if I'd only have the reaction in a
 certain type of restaurant but I've had the reaction in Chinese
 restaurants and Greek restaurants and Italian restaurants and Steak
 places I can tell you when a steak joint uses Accent to tenderize
 their meat   

OH  and just in case anyone thinks I'm prejudice against either
Chinese food or Asian people  I'm not going home to cook some Chinese
food for the guy I'm marrying next week  Incidentally his last name
is Wu

Last year I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an
inguinal hernia  I couldn't remember doing anything that would have
caused it  That is I hadn't been lifting more than other people do
and in fact probably somewhat less  Eventually the thing became more
painful and I had the repair operation

This year I developed a pain on the other side  This turned out to be
another inguinal hernia  So I go back to the hospital Monday for
another fun  operation

I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen  I'm 
years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling
apart like this  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to
suspect a congenital weakness but if so why did it suddenly appear
when I was  and not really as active as I was when I was younger

Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia other than not lifting
anything  It's rare that I lift more than my monthold or a sack
full of groceries and you may have noticed that your typical grocery
sack is fairly small these days  Is there some sort of exercise that
will reduce the risk

Of course my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at
the computer reading news

There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries

By Mike Royko
Tribune Media Services


     On a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctors' earnings 
is right up there  It almost scored a perfect braindead 
     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called 
Families USA
      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe 
that doctors make too much money
     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for 
physicians  Those polled said oh about  a year would be 
OK
     How generous  How sporting  How stupid
     Why is this poll stupid   Because it is based on resentment 
and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign 
and are still simmering
     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that 
earns plus and get the same results  Since the majority 
of Americans don't make those bucks  they assume that those  who 
do are stealing it from them
     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down  but don't  kid  yourself  
Karl Marx lives
     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions  such 
as  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to 
become a physician
     If those polled said no  they didn't know then they should 
have  been disqualified   If they gave the wrong  answers  they 
should have been dropped   What good are their views on how much 
a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a 
doctor
     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way  How 
much  should  a person earn if he or she must a  get  excellent 
grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order 
to b be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking 
courses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work and 
maintain a  average or better  and c spend four more  years 
of  grinding study in medical school  with the third and  fourth 
years in clinical training  working  to  hours a week  and 
d spend another year as a lowpay  hardwork intern  and  e 
put  in  another  three to  years  of  postgraduate  training 
depending  on  your specialty and f maybe wind up    in 
debt  after  medical school and g then work an  average  of   
hours  a week  with many family doctors putting in   hours  or 
more until they retire or fall over
     As  you have probably guessed by now  I  have  considerably 
more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and 
Clinton  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have 
called together to remake America's health care
     Based  on what doctors contribute to society  they are  far 
more useful than the powerhappy  egotripping programspewing 
social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is 
to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality
     But propaganda works   And  as the stupid poll  indicates 
many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the 
major cause of high medical costs
     Of  course doctors are wellcompensated   They  should  be  
Americans now live longer than ever   But who is responsible for 
our longevitylawyers  Congress or the guy flipping burgers in 
a McDonald's
     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become 
a  nation  of  selfindulgent   lardbutted   TVgaping   couch 
cabbages
     Ah  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or 
Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since   But 
instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain 
they might have been more honest if they had said
     Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest 
problems we have   That problem is you my fellow American Yes 
you  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods  many  of  you 
guzzling  too  much hooch  still puffing away at   a  pack 
getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the 
microwave to the couch doing dope and bringing crack babies into 
the  world  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot 
victims  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease 
while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure
     You  and  your habits  not the  doctors  are  the  single 
biggest  health  problem in this country   If  anything  it  is 
amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do
     In fact  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at 
your blubbery bods all day
     So as your president  I call upon you to stop whining  and 
start living cleanly   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy
greasy with double fries  Do as I say not as I do
     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid 
there is another solution Don't use them
     That's right   You don't feel well   Then try one of those 
spine poppers  needle twirlers or have Rev Bubba lay his hands 
upon your head and declare you fit
     Or  there is the doityourself approach   You  have  chest 
pains   Then sit in front of a mirror  make a slit here a slit 
there and pop in a couple of valves
     You're  going to have a kid   Why throw your money at  that 
overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house 
than  you  will  ever  have  while  paying  more  in  taxes  and 
malpractice insurance than you will ever earn
     Just have the kid the oldfashioned way   Squat and do  it  
And if it survives  you can go to the library and find a book on 
how to give it its shots
     By  the  way  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much 
pollsters should earn

As for how foods taste  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it why shouldn't I use it  Saying I shouldn't use
it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer

Julie it doesn't necessarily follow that you should use it MSG or
something else for that matter simply because you are not allergic
to it For example you might not be allergic to animal fats and
like their taste yet it doesn't follow that you should be using them
regularly MSG might have other bad or good I am not up on 
knowledge of MSG effects on your body in the long run maybe that's
reason enough not to use it 

Altho' your example of the ulcer is funny it isn't an
appropriate comparison at all

Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly  Does 
shortterm use of the drug ever produce longterm sideeffects after
the use of the drug  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized
and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks  Although the
drug has been terminated she has changed from a perky slightly
senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone
and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance  It
seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the
course of just one and onehalf months  I have to believe that the
combination of the hospital stay and some drugs are in part
catalysts for this  Any comments

Looking in The Evolution of Anaesthesia by MH Armstrong Davison
pub Williams  Wilkins Baltimore  I found the following
chronology

  CharlesGabriel Pravaz  inventor of the
galvanocautery describes a glass syringe with tapered nozzle This
syringe was intended to be used with a special trocar for injecting
ferric chloride into aneurysms and thus to heal them by coagulation

  Alexander Wood   of Edinburgh invents the hypodermic
needle and adapts Pravaz's syringe for use with it

Christopher Wren in  described by Oldenberg  Clarck in the

 All that's needed now is that final step a doubleblind study done

 harm as this is a widely used and approved food additive

But  some say that only  of the population has a problem with MSG

If you knew enough about what the test was about to decide that you didn't want

From now on it looks like  shots per week for
 months followed by  shot per month or so Each shot costs
 Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system I would
call that a racket We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses
here but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office
Apart from this issue I was somewhat disappointed to find out
that you have to keep getting the shots forever Is that right

You might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual
drops instead of shots for treatment You are given a small bottle of
antigens  drops are placed under the tongue for  minutes My
allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way Throughout the treatment
process I had to return to the doctor's office every month for retesting
and a new bottle of antigens After the allergy was completely neutralized
a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about  months the sublingual
drops are then taken  times per week and costs  So the cost is
less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home

MessageID APRfsphyphysicsfsuedu

First I'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go
through this  I know it has to have been tough

There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly
adults  The change in environment can cause problems  Anesthetic agents
can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of
the body as easily  In addition medications and interactions between
medications can cause confusion

As far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after
the drug has been discontinued I do not know  I have not seen anything
to that effect  However I also had not been looking for that information
I can see what I can find

I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug and according to
the Nursing Drug handbook it is Especially useful for agitation
associated with senile dementia  p   It also should not be 
discontinued abruptly  It did not say anything about long lasting
effects

Because so many things can cause confusion it is hard for me to know
what else was going on at the time if I had more history i might be able
to answer you better  If you want to send me email with more information
I would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might have
happened

The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital
but I can answer a few general points

Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after
being in hospital for a few days The drastic change of environment
will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home Even
young people find the change unsettling

Though we have thought that this decrement in function after  say 
anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip a common event in the
elderly was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the
change of situation is much more important Some hospitals have
tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures aiming to have the
patient back at home within  hours of admission The selection of
the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these
patients early

Anaesthetists who work with the elderly which is almost all of us
generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to
the individual patient Even so there is some evidence that full
mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return This is
the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult
tasks not the gross change that the original poster noted

Haloperidol Haldol TM is a long acting drug The plasma half life
of the drug is up to  hours If the decanoate a sort of slow
release formulation is used it may be weeks The elderly are
sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons Without knowing
more it is hard to comment

I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
demented during hospital stays In the examples I've seen drugs were
definitely involved 

My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
hospital He was fiftythree at the time and he was on  separate
medications The family protested but the doctors were adamant telling
us that none of the drugs interact They even took the attitude that if
he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well With
the help of an MD friend of the family we had all his medication
discontinued He had a seizure that night and was put back on one drug
Two days later he was his old self again I guess there aren't many
medical texts that address the subject of way interactions

I don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession It is an
aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me Docs seem to believe
that because they have close control of you it's quite all right to
take your bodily equilibria into their own hands That control reduces
the chance that the patient will make a mistake but health care
providers can make mistakes too and mistakes can be deadly under those
circumstances 

I grant you that sometimes there's no choice Nevertheless I suggest
you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss
it with an independent doc Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL
at all HALDOL may have been used validly or it may have been
prescribed because OTHER medication confused her and because the
hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly

Just my opinion

Larry obviously not a doc C

While I don't have an answer for you I reckon Blaise Pascal is generally
credited with inventing the syringe per se  I don't know much about the
needles however I do know of a southwest Virginia country doctor who
some thrity or more years ago invented patented used and sold a syringe
hypodermic needle combination that retracted injected with the flip of a
trigger then retracted giving a nearpainless injection  The fellow was
Dr Daniel Gabriel and it was termed the Gabrielsomebody else syringe 
Did you come across that one  Plastic disposable syringes came onto the
market about that time and his product went by the wayside to my knowledge

My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the

No wonder he became confused  With so many drugs it is almost impossible
to know which one is causing the problem  And because some drugs 
potentiate the effect of each other they can make the side effects
all the worse and even dangerous  kinda like mixing alcohol and 
antihistamines

he was disoriened the doctors thougt  they should put him on something
else as well

Unfortunately doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of
the drugs a patient is receiving  If one drug they are taking causes
the patient's blood pressure to go up many times an antihypertensive
is prescribed instead of reevaluating the need for the original drug
This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs
at home

procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss
it with an independent doc Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL
at all HALDOL may have been used validly or it may have been
prescribed because OTHER medication confused her and because the
hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly

I fully agree  In addition she proably should be examined by another
doctor who can reevaluate the need for the medications she is taking
I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during
a lecture but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have
the need for the drug reevaluated regularly  If her current physician
is unwilling to do this find one who will  Either check the phone 
book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology 
or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society
By finding a geriatric specialist he she will more likely be in tune
with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help

     Cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly  million of the 
approximately  million annual deliveries in the United States since  
Table  The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 
 reporting countries exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico  This 
report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital 
Discharge Survey NHDS for  and compares these data with previous years 
     Data on discharges from shortstay nonfederal hospitals have been 
collected annually since  in the NHDS conducted by CDC's National Center 
for Health Statistics For  medical and demographic information were 
abstracted from a sample of  inpatients discharged from  
participating hospitals The  cesareans and vaginal births after a prior 
cesarean VBAC presented in this report are based on weighted national 
estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately   women discharged 
after delivery The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were 
calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from 
national vital registration data Therefore estimates of the number of 
cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based 
solely on the NHDS  Stated differences in this analysis are significant at 
the  confidence level based on the twotailed ttest with a critical value 
of

in  and similar to rates during  Table  The primary cesarean 
rate ie number of first cesareans per  deliveries to women who had no 
previous cesareans for  also was stable ranging from  to

 Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to  years 
than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or 
government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than  beds than in larger 
hospitals and for deliveries for which Blue CrossBlue Shield  and other 
private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of 
payment Table  The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries 
     Since the early s the number and percentage of births to older women 
increased however if the age distribution of mothers in  had remained 
the same as in  the overall cesarean rate in  would have been  
essentially the same as the  observed

comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was  days 
and for a repeat cesarean  days  nearly twice the duration for VBAC 
deliveries  days or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs  
days In  the average hospital stay for all deliveries was  days for 
primary cesareans  days for repeat cesareans  days and for VBAC and 
nonVBAC vaginal deliveries  and  days respectively

Editorial Note The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 
 through  however the findings in this report indicate that rates 
have been stable since   Because there is little evidence that 
maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because 
cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of 
childbirth a national health objective for the year   is to reduce the 
overall cesarean rate to  or fewer per  deliveries and the primary 
cesarean rate to  or fewer per  deliveries objective  
     Postpartum complications  including urinary tract and wound infections 
 may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries 
than for vaginal births  Moreover the prolonged hospital stays for 
cesarean deliveries substantially increase healthcare costs For example in 
 the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were  and 
 respectively The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes 
 for physician fees and  for hospital charges  If the cesarean 
rate in  had been  the year  objective instead of  the number 
of cesarean births would have decreased by   versus  
resulting in a savings of more than  billion in physician fees and hospital 
charges 
     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since  several factors may 
impede progress toward the year  national health objectives for cesarean 
delivery For example VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women 
offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since   
Of women who are offered a trial of labor  could deliver vaginally  
a level already achieved by many hospitals  Trial of labor was routinely 
offered in  of hospitals surveyed in  the most recent year for which

national data are available  when the VBAC rate according to NHDS data 
was  The year  objective specifies a VBAC rate of  based on all 
women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was 
attempted To reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the 
VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary 
rate 
     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by 
applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean 
delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peerreview 
process  Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates 
include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing 
reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of 
physician and hospitalspecific cesarean delivery rates to increase public 
awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns 
which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean 
delivery

         Malaria Among US Embassy Personnel  Kampala Uganda 
         
                   SOURCE MMWR    DATE Apr  

     The treatment and prevention of malaria in Africa has become a 
challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance 
Although the risk of acquiring malaria for US citizens and their dependents 
stationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially and 
unpredictably During May  the Office of Medical Services Department of 
State OMSDOS and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases 
among official US personnel stationed in Kampala Uganda A review of the 
health records from the Embassy Health Unit EHU in Kampala indicated that  
cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 
 compared with two cases during the same period in  EHU OMSDOS and 
CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and 
identify potential risk factors for malaria among US Embassy personnel This 
report summarizes the results of the investigation 
     Malaria blood smears from  of the  reported casepatients were 
available for review by OMSDOS and CDC A case of malaria was confirmed if 
the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp Of the  persons  were slide
confirmed as having malaria 
     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to 
obtain information about residence activities use of malaria 
chemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures ie using bednets 
and insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing long 
sleeves and pants in the evening Of the  persons eligible for the survey 
  responded 
     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in 
Kampala Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less 
than or equal to  years   than among persons greater than  
years   this difference was not significant relative risk 
RR  confidence interval CI Eightytwo percent of the 
cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for  years 
compared with those living there less than  year Travel outside of the 
Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for 
malaria 
     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who 
participated in the survey mefloquine chloroquine and proguanil chloroquine 
alone and proguanil alone In addition   persons who responded were 
not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis The risk for malaria was significantly 
lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil  
 than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis  
 RR  CI Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported 
side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason 
     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets

used bednets   RR  CI The risk for malaria was 
also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening 
 compared with those who rarely used repellent   RR 
upper  confidence limit Risk for malaria was not associated with 
failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the 
evening 
     As a result of this investigation EHU staff reviewed with all personnel 
the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
regimens EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection 
measures and made plans to obtain insecticideimpregnated bednets and to 
provide window and door screens for all personnel

Editorial Note In Uganda the increase in malaria among US personnel was 
attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased 
malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in subSaharan 
Africa The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and 
continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in 
malariaendemic areas  preventive measures that are also important for 
shortterm travelers to such areas 
     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most 
other areas with chloroquineresistant P falciparum however in some areas 
eg Thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness In 
Africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in 
preventing infection with P falciparum is    Mefloquine is safe and 
well tolerated when given at  mg per week over a year period The risk 
for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis 
eg psychosis and convulsions is low ie  episodes per  
users  while the risk for less severe adverse reactions eg dizziness 
gastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances is similar to that for 
other antimalarial chemoprophylactics  
     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the need 
for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen 
 Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense 
chloroquine resistance eg Southeast Asia and Africa In Africa for 
persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline chloroquine and proguanil 
is an alternative although less effective regimen Chloroquine should be 
used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquineresistant P 
falciparum has not been reported

     Haemophilus influenzae type b Hib conjugate vaccines have been 
recommended for use in infants since  and their routine use in infant 
vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of Hib 
disease in the United States  Vaccines against diphtheria tetanus and 
pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the 
United States since the late s and has been associated with a greater than 
 reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these 
organisms Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely 
recommended for infants a high priority is the development of combined 
vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate 
injections

for vaccinating children against these diseases  the Haemophilus b 
conjugate vaccine tetanus toxoid conjugate ActHIB Trademark  for 
vaccination against Hib disease only and  a combined diphtheria and tetanus

all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b 
conjugate vaccines beginning at  months of age and a booster dose at age 
 months  The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a fourdose 
primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at  
  and  months of age and a booster dose at  years  A

            International Workshop Explores Oral Manifestations of
                                 HIV Infection

                                  March 
                     National Institute of Dental Research

     At the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV 
Infection held January February  in San Francisco participants explored 
issues related to the epidemiology basic molecular virology mucosal 
immunology and oral clinical presentations of HIV infection 
     The workshop was organized by Dr John Greenspan and Dr Deborah 
Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology School of Dentistry University of 
California San Francisco  An international steering committee and scientific 
program committee provided guidance 
     The conference drew more than  scientists from  countries including 
Asia Africa Europe Central America South America as well as the United 
States and Canada  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National 
Institute of Dental Research the National Cancer Institute the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases the NIH Office of AIDS Research 
and the Procter and Gamble Company 
     Among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of HIV lesions ethics 
professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provision 
of oral care to the HIVpositive population salivary HIV transmission and 
mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric HIV infection and 
women's issues 

                                Recommendations

     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association 
between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV to 
establish a universal terminology for HIVassociated oral lesions to look for 
more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology 
studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral 
lesions and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions 

                                 Epidemiology

     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV 
Infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of HIV infection has 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page

radically changed  In  HIV infection was detected and reported largely 
in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs  
Today more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in 
children and adolescents 
     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa a 
major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well  
Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more 
are appearing all the time 
     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions 
such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis  They also are beginning to explore 
the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression 
and prognosis 

                            Socialpolitical Issues

     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection 
focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for 
indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use  Speakers also addressed health 
care delivery for HIVinfected patients and the need to educate the public 
about what AIDS is and how it is acquired 

                          Saliva and Salivary Glands

     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIVinhibitory 
activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary 
secretions  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular 
secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid 
secretions  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible 
for salivary inhibitory activity  They attributed the HIVinhibitory effect 
of saliva to the  aggregationagglutination of HIV by saliva which may both 
promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and  
direct effects on the virus or target cells 
     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease 
in HIVinfected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity 

                               Pediatric Issues

     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest  With 
early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of HIV
infected children has tripled  The prevention of transmission of HIV from 
mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mother's 
serostatus is known prior to giving birth 

                    Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease

Volume   Number                                            April  

     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and 
gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection  Recommendations made at 
the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of 
diagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper consideration 
of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy 

                       Occupational and Treatment Issues

     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIVinfected individuals 
and treatment rendered by HIVinfected health care professionals still command 
considerable attention  Factors under consideration include the costbenefit 
of HIV testing patienttohealth care provider transmission of HIV infection 
and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the

              FDA Approves Depo Provera injectable contraceptive
                      P Food and Drug Administration
              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Susan Cruzan   


The Food and Drug Administration today announced the approval of Depo Provera 
an injectable contraceptive drug 

The drug which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone 
progesterone protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection 
The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is 
released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy It is more than  percent 
effective

This drug presents another longterm effective option for women to prevent 
pregnancy said FDA Commissioner David A Kessler MD As an injectable 
given once every three months Depo Provera eliminates problems related to 
missing a daily dose

Depo Provera is available in  mg single dose vials from doctors and 
clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive 
protection If a patient decides to become pregnant she discontinues the 
injections

As with any such products FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and 
risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional 
before making a decision to use it

Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive 
studies by the manufacturer the World Health Organization and health agencies 
in other countries US clinical trials begun in  also found Depo 
Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive

The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain In 
addition some patients may experience headache nervousness abdominal pain 
dizziness weakness or fatigue The drug should not be used in women who have 
acute liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding breast cancer or blood 
clots in the legs lungs or eyes

The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the 
drug due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug

Recent data have also demonstrated that longterm use may contribute to 
osteoporosis The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this 
potential effect

Depo Provera was Developed in the s and has been approved for 
contraception in many other countries The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo Mich 
which will market the drug under the name Depo Provera Contraceptive 
Injection first submitted it for approval in the United States in the s 
At that time animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause 
breast cancer Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer 
including breast cancer in humans to be minimal if any

       New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for LifeThreatening Illnesses
                      P Food and Drug Administration
                        Monica Revelle   

The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new 
rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life
threatening illnesses such as AIDS cancer and Alzheimer's disease 

These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious 
illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would 
otherwise be possible said HHS Secretary Louis W Sullivan MD The effort 
to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a longterm commitment and 
indeed a hallmark of this administration 

These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to 
approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers They apply when the 
drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies Such 
endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in 
themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified 
scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient 

Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval 
earlier than if traditional endpoints  such as relief of disease symptoms or 
prevention of disability and death from the disease  are used 

The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and 
effectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably established 
The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct 
postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate 
endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness 

One new drug  zalcitabine also called ddC  was approved June  using a 
model of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus HIV the 
cause of AIDS 

Accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when FDA determines that 
a drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be used 
safely only under a restricted distribution plan 

The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process 
without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight said FDA 
commissioner David A Kessler MD While drug approval will be accomplished 
faster these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and 
effectiveness standards required by law

The new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the 
postmarketing studies do not verify the drug's clinical benefit if there is 
new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective or 
if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal 
of the drug or biologic

               Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing
                       Blindness due to Retinal Disease

                   National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation

        Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests

     Baltimore MD  Researchers at the University of California San Francisco 
and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc NASDAQ REGN have discovered that 
certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can 
prevent the degeneration of lightsensing cells in the retina of the eye The 
degeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause of 
visual impairment 
     This research published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Science PNAS holds promise for people who may lose 
their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration  currently no drug 
treatment for retinal degeneration exists It is estimated that  million 
Americans have severe vision loss due to agerelated macular degeneration and 
 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary disease 
that causes blindness In addition each year more than  people undergo 
surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas 
     The research was funded in part by the RP Retinitis Pigmentosa 
Foundation Fighting Blindness Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye 
Institute It was conducted by Drs Matthew M LaVail Kazuhiko Unoki Douglas 
Yasurnura Michael T Matthes and Roy H Steinberg at UCSF arld Dr Ceorge 
Yancoooulos Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery Regeneron holds an 
exclusive license for this research from UCSF
     In the research described in the PNAS  a lightdamage model was used to 
assess the survivalpromoting activity of a number of naturally occurring 
substances Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week 
Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their 
photoreceptor cells  the rods and cones of the retina  after light 
exposure Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor BDNF and Ciliary Neurotrophic 
Factor CNTF were particularly effective in this model without causing 
unwanted side effects other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor NGF and 
Insulinlike Growth Factor IGF were not effective in these experiments 
     Discussing the research Dr Jesse M Cedarbaum Regeneron's Director of 
Clinical Research said BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that 
have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age
related macular degeneration one of the leading causes of vision impairment 
and for retinal detachment Following detachment permanent vision loss may

result frorn the death of detached retinal cells It is possible that BDNF 
could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached 
surgically 
     Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the 
retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades Vision decreases 
to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness It is our hope 
that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression 
and preserve useful vision throughout life stated Jeanette S Felix PhD 
Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness 
     In addition to the work described  Regeneron is developing BDNF in 
conjunction with Aingen Inc NASDAQAMGN as a possible treatment for 
peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy 
motor neuron diseases Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease By 
itself Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease 
     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals Inc based in Tarrytown New York is a 
leader in the discovery and development of biotechnologybased compounds for 
the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases peripheral neuropathies and nerve 
injuries which affect more than seven million Americans Drs LaVail and 
Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron

                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease

     Highfat highcalorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary 
heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have 
traditionally consumed diets low in fat  These findings according to 
investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland have 
serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing 
countries 
     This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and 
have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels  It shows also the 
importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body 
weight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing 
countries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator Dr 
William E Connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid 
metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University 
     Over the past  years Dr Connor and his team have characterized the 
food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico while 
simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism  
These native Mexicans number approximately  and reside in the Sierra 
Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua  The Tarahumaras have 
coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing  Probably as a result coronary 
heart disease which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations is 
virtually non existent in their culture  Loosely translated the name 
Tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on 
kickball races in which participants run distances of  miles or more 
while kicking a machetecarved wooden ball
     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas 
and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water 
together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables  The Tara humaras 
also eat small amounts of game fish and eggs  Their food contains 
approximately  percent of total calories as fat of which the majority  
percent is of vegetable origin  Dietician Martha McMurry a coinvestigator 
in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while 
low in cholesterol and fat
     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of  mg dL 
lowdensity lipoprotein LDLcholesterol levels of  mgdl and highdensity 
lipoprotein HDLcholesterol levels of  to  mgdl  All of those values 
are in the good lowrisk range according to the researchers  Elevated 
cholesterol and LDLcholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart

disease  HDLcholesterol is considered beneficial  In previous studies the 
Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although 
able to respond to highcholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL
cholesterol 
     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria 
Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school 
building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi  Food 
was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the 
investigators' direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food 
stipulated by the research protocol  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly 
and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr Connors laboratory for 
cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses  Regular measurements 
included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness  
Thirteen Tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were 
fed their native diet for  week followed by  weeks of an affluent diet 
     In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was  
percent of total calories  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that 
many Americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in 
fiber elaborates Dr Conners Such dietary characteristics are reflected in 
the cholesterolsaturation index or CSI recently devised research dietitian 
Sonja Conner working with Dr Connor  The CSI is a single number that 
incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in 
the diet  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol 
level particularly the LDL Dr Connor explains  The Tarahumaran diet 
averages a very low CSI of  Dr Connor's affluent diet used in the study 
ranks a CSI of  
     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of 
establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before 
exposing subjects to the experimental diet  The standard curve relating 
dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or 
plateau for consumption of large amounts of fat  Changes in dietary fat 
andor cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels  You 
must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put 
into the experimental diet  The Framingham study for example did not 
discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease 
because the diet was already high in fat  All subjects were already eating on 
a plateau Dr Connor says 
     After  weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects' mean plasma 
cholesterol levels had in creased by  percent primarily in the LDL 
fraction which rose  percent  HDLcholesterol increased by  per cent 
and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little  Plasma triglyceride 
levels increased by  percent and subjects averaged an pound gain in 
weight  According to Dr Connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon 
yielding nearly the same results after  days of affluent diet as after  
days

     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized 
nations  We think HDLcholesterol increased because we increased the amount 
of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic 
study  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary 
cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption  
In the present study we increased fat intake to  percent of the total 
calories  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects 
the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary 
cholesterol  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased 
quite a bit in this study Dr Connor explains
     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of 
coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of 
fat or cholesterol  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because 
of their usual high fat intake 
     Dr Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than  
percent of total calories as fat less than  mg of cholesterol and a CSI 
around  varying in accordance with caloric needs  Such a diet is low in 
meat and dairy fat high in fiber  Dr Connor also comments on recent 
suggestions that Americans adopt a Mediterraneanstyle diet  The original 
Mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of 
fat and very few animal and dairy products  We are already eating a lot of 
meat and dairy products  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to 
olive oil is not going to help the situation 
     The World Health Organization WHO is focusing much attention on the 
emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies 
undergoing technological development  Dr Connor says that coronary heart 
disease starts with a given society's elite who typically eat a different 
diet than the average citizen  If the pattern of afluence increases the 
entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease 
which places a termendous health care burden on a society  WHO would like the 
developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can 
concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public 
health measures to improve general wellbeing rather than paying for 
unnecessary expensive medical technology Dr Connors says
     The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move 
their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a highrisk range within a 
very short time by an affluent excessive diet  The present rate of coronary 
heart disease in the United States is  percent less than it was  years 
ago so a lot has been accomplished  We are changing rapidly he concludes

call for employers to keep  information about the HIV status of healthcare 
workers  confidential  But doctors who know of an HIVpositive colleague  who 
has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate 
professional regulatory body  The guidelines  also emphasize the significance 
of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an 
infected healthcare  worker  A model letter to patients who have come into 
contact  with such an individual is provided along with suggestions for  
health officials on how to deal with the media  In addition a  UK advisory 
panel on HIV infection in healthcare workers has  been formed to provide 
specific occupational recommendations to  those treating such patients 
    
Properties of an HIV 'Vaccine' Nature  Vol  No  P    
Volvovitz Franklin and Smith Gale 

     The questions raised by Moore et al about recombinant gp  envelope 
glycoprotein precursor from HIV produced by  MicroGeneSys are advantages 
rather than disadvantages write  Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of 
MicroGeneSys in Meriden  Conn  Moore et al says that gp in a baculovirus 
expression  system does not bind strongly to the CD receptor and that this  
recombinant gp does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV virus 
does in natural infection  But vaccination with  recombinant gp in 
patients infected with HIV broadens HIV  specific envelopedirected immune 
responses including  crossreactive antibodies to gp epitopes and CD and 
CD  cytotoxic Tcell responses  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never 
intended their gp molecule to be identical to the native protein  Antibody 
responses against native HIV proteins  including the types described by 
Moore et al exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not prevent

progression of HIV disease  In addition the binding of gp or gp
antibody complexes to  CD has been shown to interfere with antigen specific 
activation  of CD cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which  
may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection  The absence of CD 
binding by the MicroGeneSys gp vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added 
safety feature  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD counts 
stimulation of cytotoxic T cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune 
function  Based on  these and other clinical results MicroGeneSys gp was 
chosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first 
phase III vaccine therapy studies conclude Volvovitz and  Smith 
    
HIV Infection Breast Milk and HIV Transmission Lancet  Vol 
 No  P   Mok Jacqueline 

     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIVpositive 
women breastfeeding their babies writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet  The 
antiinfective properties of  milk are well documented  While the numbers of 
leukocytes  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA and lymphocyte mitogenic  
activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to 
barely detectable levels lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to 
twelve months with  percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA  
Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory 
illnesses in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIVpositive 
mothers  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV
 infected children had a longer median incubation time  months than 
bottlefed infants  months  Breastfed children also had a slower 
progression to AIDS  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer 
protection against HIV infection  Studies of  the biological properties of 
milk from  HIV infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA 
antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins as well as IgA antibodies against 
core antigens   Binding of HIV to the CD receptor can be inhibited by a 
human  milk factor  In the developing world where infectious disease  and 
malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality  breast milk is 
still the best food for infants regardless of the mother's HIV status  
Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early 
milk have been expressed  and discarded  The possibility remains that breast 
milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  
may even delay progression to AIDS concludes Mok 
    
Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients Journal

     If universal precautions are practiced the risk of HIV  transmission

et al of the University of Miami  School of Medicine in Miami Fla  The 
researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and 
attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing  Living patients 
with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed and DNA sequence  analysis 
was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the 
dentist  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the 
medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug 
abuse and those dying under the age of  years were examined in detail  
There were   patients who had undergone  procedures of whom   
were deceased  An examination of the death certificates of  patients 
identified five who had died with HIV infection all of  whom were either 
homosexuals or IVdrug users  The researchers  were able to detect  of the 
remaining  patients and   agreed to be tested  HIV infection was 
reported in five of the   patients including four who had clear evidence 
of risk  factors for the disease  One patient who had only a single  
evaluation by the dentist denied highrisk behavior  Comparative DNA sequence 
analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients 
were not closely related  The study  suggests the potential for HIV 
transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting 
in which  universal precautions are strictly observed conclude Dickinson  et

AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB Study Says Washington 
Post  P A 

     Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once which makes the 
resurging health hazard harder to control according to a  study published in 
today's New England Journal of Medicine   People who contract TB usually 
develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria 
again  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight 
off a  new TB infection doctors found  Peter M Small of the Howard  Hughes 
Medical Institute at Stanford University director of the  study said that in 
order to protect against reinfection it may  be necessary for some people to 
use TB medicines permanently   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB 
bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in  patients at Kings County 
Hospital  in New York

HIV and the Aetiology of AIDS Lancet  Vol  No  P   
Duesberg Peter 

     Because there is no proof that HIV is the cause of AIDS the  hypothesis 
that drug use leads to AIDS will hopefully become a  hindrance to the 
physiologically AZT and psychologically  positive AIDS test toxic public 
health initiatives writes  Peter Duesberg of the University of California
Berkeley  In the Lancet's March  issue Schechter et al call Duesberg's  
hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to 
AIDS a hindrance to public health initiatives   However their hypothesis 
that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits  
The US government spends   billion annually but no vaccine no therapy 
no prevention  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this 
hypothesis   Schechter et al conclude that HIV has a key role in CD  
depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies 
against HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals 
from Vancouver  However their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug
AIDS hypothesis because it  does not provide controlsie confirmed drug
free AIDS  casesand because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  
use altogether  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to 
produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to  years 
HIVpositive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same 
AIDS risks as  positives who do not do so  The  year period is claimed by

proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS  
Alternatively they could show that HIVfree  individuals who have used drugs 
for  years never get  AIDSdefining illnesses concludes Duesberg 
   
Rapid Decline of CD Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV  Infection 
Lancet  Vol  No  P    Vento Sandro et al 

     Interferon IFN which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases 
in some settings may hasten CD Tcell loss in some  HIV infected 
individuals through the amplification of harmful  autoimmune reactions 
write Sandro Vento et al of the A  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro Italy  
The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV infected individuals with 
hepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis CAH who had a rapid  
profound decline of CD cells after IFN  All three patients  throughout the 
observation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p antigen and had 
circulating antibodies to p  Sera from all three patients obtained at the 
end of IFN treatment and  testing in enzymelinked immunosorbent assay 
contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  
aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens 
homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV gp  
These autoantibodies which also  recognize native class II molecules and 
may contribute to the  elimination of CD T cells in vivo were at low tires 
  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN  Such  
autoantibodies were not detected in  other patients with HIV  infection and 
HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD Tcell loss 
in some HIV infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful 
autoimmune reactions  The subjects had A B DR and B DR HLA 
antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD cell 
counts and  clinical progression of HIV disease  IFN can induce a very  
rapid decline of CD cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with 
these HLA haplotypes the researchers conclude

TB Makes a Comeback State Government News  Vol  No  P    
Voit William and Knapp Elaine S 

     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United 
States it is emerging again among the homeless AIDS  patients immigrants 
minorities and prisoners  Dr Lee B  Reichman professor of medicine at the 
University of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung 
Association  said Right now it's a big city problem but potentially it's  
everyone's problem  The ALA predicts that  million Americans  are infected 
with TB and about  percent of them will develop  the disease because their 
immune systems are depressed  especially those with AIDS or HIV  Gene

Tammes a Centers for  Disease Control expert said that is why the CDC has 
issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS  with TB 
patients  State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because 
those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with 
treatment  In addition the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public 
health services   In New York City TB is an epidemic because the number of 
cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people said Dr George  
Diferdinando director of the New York State TB Control   According to 
Diferdinando curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping  percent or more of 
diagnosed TB cases in treatment   About  percent of infected New York City 
residents don't  complete therapy  When TB patients don't finish taking their  
medication multidrug resistant TB can develop which requires  taking more 
expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to 
treat
     
 Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern 
Florida Artifact or Reality American Journal of Public Health  Vol 
 No  P   Nwanyanwu Okey C et al 

     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in 
southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk write 
Okey C Nwanyanwu et al of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta Ga  
The researchers investigated  such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal 
Palm Beach counties  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual 
transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men injecting drug users 
or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route 
of HIV transmission  Medical records of patients  in addition to records 
from social services HIV counseling and  testing centers and sexually 
transmitted disease STD clinics  were reviewed  If no other HIV risk factor 
was found from  medical record review patients were interviewed using a  
standardized questionnaire  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were 
reviewed  men and  women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission 
categories  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification the 
percentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties 
between January   and March   that was attributed to 
heterosexual transmission  decreased from  percent to  percent among men 
and from   percent to  percent among women  While the percentage of  
heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after 
adjustment was made for reclassified cases it  still remained above the 
national average the researchers  conclude

 former patients on whom an HIVpositive orthopedic surgeon performed 
invasive  procedures between January   and June    The  
orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive 
for HIV  A total of  former patients  underwent HIV testing 
representing  percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon 
performed invasive procedures during  the year period  Patients were 
tested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure  All 
patients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzymelinkedimmunosorbent  
assay  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery  
The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect 
cases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients  The estimated cost of 
the initial patient  notification and testing was  with the single 
most  expensive activity being counseling and testing  This accounted  for  
percent of the total expense  The patient notification  and testing were 
conducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who 
was an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study  
Notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIVstatus is both disruptive 
and expensive  and is not routinely recommended the researchers conclude

guidelines over  percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to

 Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data New York Times  P C  
Kolata Gina 

     A total of  major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a  highly 
unusual move to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are 
undergoing early clinical testing  Dr Edward  Scolnick president of the 
Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway  NJ arranged the collaboration  He 
said that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it 
had  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective 
in fighting HIV than any drug used alone  The  researchers are hopeful that 
HIV when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at 
different sites for  resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the 
mutations at the same time  Therefore several drugs taken together or one 
after the other could halt the spread of HIV  Currently the  drug companies 
do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing  The new 
agreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data 
on new AIDS drugs  An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate

companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a 
much more  efficient way said Scolnick  He also said that the  
collaboration would not violate antitrust laws  In creating the  agreement 
Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups including ACTUP  
Dr Daniel Hoth director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute 
of Allergy and  Infectious Disease said We're delighted to see the  
pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the 
information flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for

The Next Step in AIDS Treatment Nature  Vol  No  P   
Maddox John 

     Although AZT was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives  of 
people infected with HIV the findings do not indicate that  AZT should not be 
administered in people with fullblown AIDS  writes columnist John Maddox  
AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIVpositive people on 
the basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of  
Tcell counts  However a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should 
not be used early in the course of disease  While the CD counts of the  
people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving 
only placebo the first three  years of followup have shown that the 
proportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to 
death were  not significantly different at roughly  percent  The  
conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIVinfected 
individuals and that CD cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the 
progression to AIDS in infected people   But nothing is implied by the study 
of the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already 
appearedthere  is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the  
evidence now available  It is much more alarming that the CD  count has 
proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV 
infection  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the 
beginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of 
disease  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself 
provide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS concludes

enrolled at delivery in Kigali Rwanda milk samples were collected  days  
months and  months post partum  HIV IgG secretory IgA and IgM were

infected cells in the milk   days post partum was strongly predictive of 
HIV infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis  
The  combination of HIV infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM 
response was the strongest predictor of infection  IgM and  IgA antiHIV in 
breastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV the researchers

Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on earlystage AIDS

BristolMyers Squibb Co Burroughs Wellcome Glaxo Inc  HoffmanLa Roche 
Eli Lilly  Co Pfizer Inc Smithkline  Beecham AB Astra Du Pont Merck 
Syntex Inc Boehringer  Ingelheim Miles Inc and SigmaTau  The 
participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they 
were aware  of had joined the collaboration and that any company actively  
involved in HIV antiviral development may participate  Scolnick said the 
collaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong

A   From some of the replies to my original posting it's evident that some
A   people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected
                        
 Include small amounts of hot spicy foods with your meals It's
 not a cure but many people find it helpful to create extra mucus
 You may also consider taking a few drops of iodine in juice or water 
 consult your doctor first which is available OTC in Canada
 If you have a sedentary lifestyle exercising sometimes helps

A   from environmental influences ie dry air But I've had no responses
A   from anyone with experience with Rutin Is there another newsgroup that
                      
A   might have specifics on herbal remedies
A  
A   Robert Allison

 I tried to email you but our board is having internet problems
 so I'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not
 
 Rutin is NOT a herb but part of the bioflavonoid complex You should
 generally not take rutin by itself but take the whole bioflavonoid 
 complex instead If you don't and there are some exceptions to that
 you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency which is the other
 major component of the bioflavonoid complex
 I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin after it
 showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be
 fore A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in 
 hesperidin which from then on made me always add bioflavonoids 
 to anyone that had very low levels of rutin
 Most of the time people are equally low in rutin and hesperidin so
 there is really no reason to take rutin by itself but use the whole
 bioflavonoid complex instead

 I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that 
 they had been helped with hemorrhoids varicose veins chronic nose 
 bleeds aneurysms gastrointestinal bleeding due to drugs etc
 One patient in desperation took a whole bottle 's in one day
 for his painful bleeding hemorrhoids without any ill effects
  
 They are also nontoxic in very high amounts that's why they can
 be safely recommended If you are allergic to citrus fruit they are
 made from their peels pine bark sources are available as well

 About  of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency 
 with the average daily dosage needed being about   mg
 For major complaints   mgday is common
 
 In case they cannot be taken because of their size and taste they
 are big and they don't taste that great a product made from pine 
 bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite
 small and taste much better however the cost is about seven times
 higher for the equivalent effect One mg tablet of the pine bark
 extract gives you about the same effect as mg of bioflavonoids
 The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol'
  
   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are
 
   Questmg   big bitter not chewable
   Swiss Herbalmg   smooth easier swallowing 
   Jamiesonmg   medium bitter chewable 

   SISUmg   Pycnogenol small easy swallowing
 
   Give them a try and see what happensand good luck

When I was a school boy my biology teacher told us of an incident

sexual intercourse  Somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm
cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation

Was my biology teacher misinforming us or do such incidents actually
occur

Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg  There is only one way for
pregnancy to occur intercourse  These days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques but we're speaking of
natural acts here  It is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is
deposited just outside of the vagina ie coitus interruptus but that's
about at far as you can get  Through clothes  no way  Better go talk
to your biology teacher

 I was just wondering if exercises specific to particular regions of the
 body such as thighs will basically only tone the thighs or if fat
 from other parts of the body such as breasts would be affected just as
 much

There are two different mechanisms here  toning of muscles and reduction of
fat  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles
exercised example look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching
arms and nonpitching arms in major league pitchers  However if exercise
also leads to reduction of body fat the loss of body fat will be equally
distributed over the entire body  There is no way to spot reduce body fat
other than surgically through liposuction Distribution of body fat is
genetically determined  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like fat
so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may appear as though the fat
is changing into muscle but really fat and muscle tissues are totally
separate and one does not ever change into the other

So if you have any evidence against the hypothesis  for example
controlled doubleblind studies showing that the antifungals don't do any
better than sugar water  then let's hear it  If you don't then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject
disbelief on the other

I don't have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS 
I'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does  Do you really think
that in the absence of a doubleblind study I should be indifferent
to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS

For what it's worth I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin
for candida hypersensitivity syndrome  It was published in the 
New England Journal I think  and showed no benefit on systemic
symptoms though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections not
surprisingly  As I recall the yeast crowd had some major objections
to the study though I don't remember what they were

Hi

Thought I'd add something to the conversation 

My girlfriend used to work in a lab studying different natural carcinogens
She mentioned once about the cancerous effect of barbecued food
Basically she said that if you eat barbecued foods with strawberries
a natural carcinogen the slight carcinogenic properties of both
cancel out each other

pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots

  I stated that psychotherapy meaning talking therapy and so on was used 
    to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder which though sometimes true is 
    misleading  It is not often found effective particularly by itself
    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug
    therapy  The most current theories of this condition attribute 
    it to more to biological causes than psychological in places where this
    distinction becomes important

  I mentioned that the DSMIIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible 
	diagnostic marker  However this might look like something
	people associate with psychotic conditions uncontrollable or
	unpredictable behaviors which is NOT the case with OCD  
	One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual
	can and does suppress some of their 'impulses' although they
	are an unending source of anxiety  
	The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with 
	OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable closer to
	a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part

	Some references one nontechnical and several technical
	that someone was kind enough to supply for me
	but was unable to post themself 

The boy who couldn't stop washing by judith rapaport   

	technical refs 

	pharmacotherapy of oc disorder
	donna m jermain and lynn crismon

	And thanks very much to those who supplied constructive  
	criticism to my first post on OCD  I hope this helps clarify
	the parts that were misleading

Summary Brief intro to mind machines in general


In article CsnwwGAtriposcom homertriposcom Webster Homer writes
I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific 
brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them 

The principle underlying these devices is a well establish principle in
psychology called 'entrainment' whereby external sensory stimuli
influence gross electrical patterns of brain function

They are 'experimental' in that people experiment with them and they
are not widely if at all used in medicine for therapeutic purposes  
Given the exception of TENS and similar units used for external electrical 
stimulation usually for pain relief not really a light and sound machine

They are not experimental in the sense of a specific medical 
category to that effect as with experimental drugs as the FDA does not 
specifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals   

I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful

There are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effects
for mind machines other than those relaxationrelated effects found with 
meditation or selfhypnosis as well  Reported benefits are mostly anecdotal and
subjective so far so it's hard to generalize about their potential value

A pretty good general nontechnical introduction to a wide variety
of these devices may be found in Would the Buddha Wear a Walkman 
Some interesting background material names of suppliers and capsule reviews
of specific equipment  

do these mind machines aka Light and Sound machines work can they induce
alpha theta andor delta waves in a person wearing them What research if
any has been done on them Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer
Or are they just another bit of quackery

A more important question might be whether they have enough additional
value to be worth investing in  'Biofeedback' was found to be a legitimate
and reliable effect experimentally under certain conditions in that
it demonstrated that we can influence physiological processes previously 
considered purely autonomic but never panned out as a particularly valuable 
therapeutic tool because of the skill level required and the subtlety and
temporary nature of the effects in most cases   Maybe someone else 
has more there used to be a whole mailing list devoted to mind machines
somewhere on the net

photography registers the electromagnetical fields around objects in simple
it takes pictures of your aura

Greg  Flame definitely intended here  Bill was making fun of the misspelling 
Go look up the word krill  Also the correct spelling is Kirlian  It
involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a highvoltage source not of some aura  It works equally well
with inanimate objects

As for how foods taste  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it why shouldn't I use it  Saying I shouldn't use
it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer

Julie it doesn't necessarily follow that you should use it MSG or
something else for that matter simply because you are not allergic
to it For example you might not be allergic to animal fats and
like their taste yet it doesn't follow that you should be using them
regularly MSG might have other bad or good I am not up on 
knowledge of MSG effects on your body in the long run maybe that's
reason enough not to use it 

Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms soya beans and brie cheese
which all have MSG in them  It occurs naturally

I'm not going to quit eating something that I like just because
it might cause me trouble later or causes problems in some
people  I would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over
what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting
reports of what is goodbad for you

I may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for me
Fine  I've made my decision and I don't think it's appropriate
for anyone to try to 'convert' me  It's for your own good are
the most obnoxious and harmful words IMO in the English or
any other language


Altho' your example of the ulcer is funny it isn't an
appropriate comparison at all

I think it is  I get tired of people saying 'don't eat X because
it's BAD'  Well X may not be bad for everyone  And even if
it is so what  Give people all the information but don't ram
your decisions down their throats

I don't like the term quack being applied to a licensed physician David
Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethicalin my opinion
 
	 Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has 
	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerouscyanide release by 
	   the NCI
 
 Hmm  This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack
 therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed
 laetrile whether licensed or not as a quack  There are unethical
 behaviors such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees
 which I would not lable as quackish but prescribing known ineffective
 therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a quack
  
 David Rind

One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical 
literature to keep up with changes in medical practice  All the clamor 
over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical 
trials which provedto me anyway that laetril was ineffective against 
cancer  A physician who continued to use it when better more effective 
treatments are available may deserve to be called a quack  Antifungals 
are in a different class  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to 
use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that could be due 
to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics  Gorden 
Rubenfeld through email has assured me that most physicians recognize 
the chance of candida blooms occuring after broadspectrum antibiotic use 
and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to 
restore competetion for candida in the body  I do not believe that this is 
yet a standard part of medical practice  He deals with critical care 
patients where fungal infectionsystemic is a real problem and just 
because he tries to keep good bacteria in his patients does not mean that 
all physicians do this  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be 
found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida  Women have been known 
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a 
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and 
not give give her advise to use the OTC antifungal creams  Since candida 
colonizes primarily in the anorectal area GI symptoms should be more common 
than vaginal problems after broadspectrum antibiotic use

The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by 
a candida bloom  The arguement is that without proof no action is 
warrented

Medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way  There 
has always been the use of conventional wisdom  A very good example is 
kidney stones  Conventional wisdombecause clinical trails have not been 
done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the 
intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones 
from forming  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to 
breakdown the stone once it formed  Through the recent New England J of 
Medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong 
increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is 
restricting calcium intake

The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to 
be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy
If it makes sense for livestock why doesn't it make sense for humans 
David  We are not talking about a dangerous treatmentunless you consider 
yogurt dangerous  If this were a standard part of medical practice as 
Gordon R says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline

 An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file'
 This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves  This
 is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural
 form so maybe that's how they evade Delany  Or maybe a special exemption
 was made to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats

One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves while root
beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark  The leaves contain either
no
or less saffrole than the bark

There is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from
sassafras products  I have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which
is
claimed to have the saffrole removed

 I think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to
 commercially producesell food with carcinogenic substances it is not illegal
 for people to do such to their own food smoking etc  Is this true

Well the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make 
root beer there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human
consumption
Also when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen
bark
she made a point of telling me that I couldn't buy sassafras for human 
consumption

I find the fact that some people reckless enough to step into an automobile
live
in fear of dropping dead because of a pork rib quite funny in a sick way

I use a ZYGON Mind Machine as bought in the USA last year  Although
it's no wonder cure for what ail's you  It is however VERY good at
stopping you thinking

Sound strange  Well suppose you're tired and want to go to bedsleep
BUT your head is full of niggling problems to resolve you lay in the
bed and quickly they all come to the surface churning around from one
unresolved thing to the next and then back again  Been there bought
the tshirt

I slip on the Zygon and select a soothing pattern of light  sound and
quickly I just can't concentrate on the previous stuff Your brain's
cache kinda get's flushed and you start on a whole new set of stuff

A useful addition is the facility to feed the output of a tape player
or CD through the box I use New Age elevator muzak to enhance the
overall effect

DEFFO better than a pill

Any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there 

The doctor thinks a friend might have this
The question is doesn't the tick have to bite you 

You frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk
in the woods around here but you tend to notice it before
it bites you pulling one out of your skin is something
you're not likely to forget

Can you get the fever without it biting you   Do they
sometimes bite you and then let go so you don't realize
you were bitten   I know they will let go once they've had
their fill but you certainly would notice this arggh

So how do you get the fever if you never pulled a tick
off yourself as opposed to finding one merely crawling
on you

to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics

I guess I'm still not clear on what the term candida bloom means
but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal
infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use
This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack
diagnosis that has been being discussed


found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida  Women have been known 
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a 
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and 
not give give her advise to use the OTC antifungal creams

Lucky how  Since a recent article randomized controlled trial of
oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis I've mentioned to a 
number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
could try eating  ounces of yogurt daily  It turns out most would
rather just use antifungal creams when they get yeast infections

yogurt dangerous  If this were a standard part of medical practice as 
Gordon R says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline

Again this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and
has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed
There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with
bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in
reducing diarrhea but I don't think anyone would view this as a
quack therapy

I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss A recent rough test
showed a gently sloping loss to db down at cps Then it falls off
a cliff to dbs down from cps on  This type of loss is difficult
to fit I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which
keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired

Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q behind the ear aids for
several weeks These have four independent programs which are intended to
be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed I
found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about
to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of
another programmable system called ReSound

Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for
about  minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex
Nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and I was
impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I
will give in a separate posting They also carry the Widex aids and had one
patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound
even though he had purchased the Widex only  months ago

The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the
Widex and other programmable aids I could take a trip to Europe on the
difference  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money I am
having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds I would
appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections
about when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite
so expensive

Could the people discussing recreational drugs such as mj lsd mdma etc
take their discussions to altdrugs Their discussions will receive greatest
contribution and readership there The people interested in strictly
smart drugs ie Nootropics should post to this group The two groups
altdrugs  altpsychoactives have been used interchangably lately
I do think that altpsychoactives is a deceiving name altpsychoactives
is supposedly the smart drug newsgroup according to newsgroup lists on
the Usenet Should we establish an altnootropics or altsdn smart drugs 
nutrients I have noticed some posts in scimednutrition regarding
smart nutrients We may lower that groups burden as well

I beg to disagree with you on this subject  If I recall correctly
altdrugs was being flodded by posts like how do I grow MJ How do I
use a bong wow man I just had the coolest trip etc  There were
quite a few people out there who were versed in pharmacology and biology
who wanted to discuss centrally active substabces at a higher level
without all the other crap filling the bandwidth    I would suggest
that you proceed to create a newsgroup dedicated to Nootropics if you
must have one dedicated to them and leave altpsychoactives to the
discussion of psychoactives including nootropics which are but a small
portion of the realm of centrally active substances

I was wondering if a group called 'scipharmacology' would be relevent
This would be used for a more formal discussion about pharmacological
issues pharmacodynamics neuropharmacology etc

Just an informal proposal I don't know anything about the netpolitics
for adding a newsgroup etc

more altpsychoactives stuff deleted

The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in
Hearing Instruments I would appreciate any comments about this and other
'new' technology for hearing aids

The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at ATT and
appears to take a different approach from other aids It appears to me that
a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible and
programmable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of
the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help
out in 'noisy' situations

The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the
spectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmable
apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in
the low frequencies while the important consonant information
unfortunately for me is in the high frequencies The two bands then are
treated with different compression schemes which are programable They have
also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call
'abnormal growth of loudness'

This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though I
think the phrase is missleading What appears to be the case is that as you
exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficit
becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach
the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge  This means
that if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the high
end for people with hearing losses Hence what you want is progressively
less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point
You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially
differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum specially
for someone like me who is relatively normal up to  cps and then falls
off a cliff

Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low
and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency
information because of high volume of low frequency components
Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech
and in simulated restaurant noise situations

to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics  Gorden 
Rubenfeld through email has assured me that most physicians recognize 
the chance of candida blooms occuring after broadspectrum antibiotic use 
and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to 
restore competetion for candida in the body  I do not believe that this is 
yet a standard part of medical practice  

  Nor is it mine  What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly
understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections
 which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections 
Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and
biochemists  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns
this At some centers preop liver transplant patients receive bowel
decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt
to prevent fungal colonization in this soontobe high risk group  I also
use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may
be in part due to alterations in gut flora  However it is NOT part of
my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after
antibiotics  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating
fungal infections in at risk patients  Whether or not it is a logical
extension from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who
base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of
clinical trials 
  One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly
recalcitrant cases of C difficile colitis NOT a fungal infection There
are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate
the patients flora  Don't try this at home 

not give give her advise to use the OTC antifungal creams  Since candida 
colonizes primarily in the anorectal area GI symptoms should be more common 
than vaginal problems after broadspectrum antibiotic use

  Except that it isn't At least symptomatically apparent disease

Medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way  There 
has always been the use of conventional wisdom  A very good example is 
kidney stones  Conventional wisdombecause clinical trails have not been 
done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the 
intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones 
from forming  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to 
breakdown the stone once it formed  Through the recent New England J of 
Medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong 
increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is 
restricting calcium intake

  Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal
conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical
trial like 

AU   DismukesWE  WadeJS  LeeJY  DockeryBK  HainJD
TI   A randomized doubleblind trial of nystatin therapy for the
     candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments
SO   NEnglJMed   Dec     P 
     psychological tests RESULTS The three activetreatment regimens
     and the allplacebo regimen
     significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms P less than
      but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms
     significantly more than placebo     
     CONCLUSIONS In women with presumed candidiasis
     hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or
     psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo Consequently
     the empirical recommendation of longterm nystatin therapy for such
     women appears to be unwarranted

  Does this trial address every issue raised here no  Jon Noring was not
surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use Sporanox despite
Crook's recommendation for Nystatin  Maybe they didn't avoid those
carbohydrates    

The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to 
be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy
If it makes sense for livestock why doesn't it make sense for humans 
David  We are not talking about a dangerous treatmentunless you consider 
yogurt dangerous  If this were a standard part of medical practice as 
Gordon R says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline

  Marty you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric
itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic
hypersensitivity symptoms Noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin
therapy of undocumented candida enteritis Elaine Palmer syndrome with
systemic symptoms  There is significant difference between the cost and
risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials  Are we talking about real
candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy
of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally
effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm
an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc  We can't seem to
focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion

This question came up in Sci Med Nutrition and I'm posting my answer 
here  Only  medical schools in the US teach courses on human 
nutrition  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do 
when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community
I think that the best example of where US medicine is really missing the 
mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS  So many womenand 
their husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that 
most physicians in the US are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by 
diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening  Before shooting 
your flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming is 
justified

From A Poster In Sci Medi Nutrition
 	In a psychological anthropology course I am taking we got 
 sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS  Some rumors shared
 by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels sugar
 intake and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms
 	Is there any data on this or is it just so much hooey
 
 Many thanks
 
 Michael I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got 
sidetracked with candida  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms most 
physicians don't recognize it as a specific disease entity  Here is 
everything that you would ever want to know about PMS

Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups

	PMTAAnxiety		PMTDdepression
	anxiety			depression
	irritability		forgetfulness
	insomnia		confusion
	depression		lethargy

	PMTCCraving		PMTHHyperhydration
	craving for sweets	weight gain
	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness
	sugar ingestion causes abdominal bloating and tenderness
	  headache		edema of the face and extremities
	  palpitations
	  fatigue or fainting
 
PMTA is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low 
progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle

PMTC is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple 
carbohydrates  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle there is 
increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose 
challenge  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMTC are 
a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E  This condition of hypoglycemia 
is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of 
hypoglycemia magnesium and PGE seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia
	A Am J Psychiatry 
Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar magnesium 
supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementationincreased to  of 
the total calories using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources 
of alpha linoleic acid

PMTD is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal 
phase of a women's cycle  Another cause of PMTD has been found to be lead 
toxicityin women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal 
phase Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human 
endometrial cystol Fertil Steril 

PMTH is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated 
serum aldosterone level  Salt restriction B magnesium and vitamin E 
for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMTH

This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form

	    a nutritional approach  A Year in Nutritional Medicine

Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can 
find a doctor who will treat you for PMSjust about as hard as finding one 
that will treat you for candida blooms  While progesterone will work 
supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better  There really 
has been an awful lot of research done on PMSmuch more than candida 
blooms  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental 
controlled studiesthe type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to 
see done

Here are a few of these studies

	CARBOHYDRATE Experimental Controlled Study Effect of a lowfat 
	highcarbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy Lancet 
	   pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy 
	of at least  years duration were randomly selected to receive 
	specific training to reduce dietary fat to  of total calories 
	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary 
	advise with no training  After  months there was a significant 
	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in 
	the trained group as reported by selfreported symptoms as well as 
	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling 
	tenderness and nodularity

	VITAMIN A Experimental Controlled Study The use of Vitamin A in 
	premenstrual tension Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand   
	 pts with severe recurring PMS received  to IU 
	vitamin A daily or a placebo  Serum retinol levels were monitored 
	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of 
	toxicity occuredserum retinol above ugml  The intent of the 
	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool 
	sizeIU to IU and then see if this 
	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS   getting the high dose 
	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS  Only  
	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms
  	 of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS 
	symptoms

	Experimental Controlled Study Premenstrual tension treated with 
	vitamin A J Clinical Endocrinology   pts 
	received IU of vitamin A daily starting on day  of their 
	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms
  	After  months all  pts reported a significant improvement in 
	PMS symptoms  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of 
	toxicity was demonstrated and all  pts were followed for one year 
	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped  PMS symptoms 
	did not reoccur in any of these  pts for upto one year after the 
	vitamin A supplementation was stopped

Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver  
These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal 
store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS  Of all the vitamins 
given for PMSvitamin A B and vitamin E vitamin A has shown the best 
single effect  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid 
estrogenprogesterone metabolism in the liver  Getting your liver full 
of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent 
the symptoms of PMS  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying 
to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin 
A toxicity

	VITAMIN B Experimental Doubleblind Crossoverr Study Pyridoxine
	vitamin B and the premenstrual syndrome A randomized crossover 
	trialJR Coll Gen Pract    women aged  
	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received mg B daily or placebo
  	After  months the groups were switched and followed for another 
	 months  B had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of 
	PMSdepression irritability and tiredness  Other symptoms of PMS 
	were not significanttly affected by B supplementation

	Experimental Doubleblind Study The efects of vitamin B 
	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms Obstet Gynecol 
	   pts with moderate to severe PMS received 
	mg B daily or placebo for  months  Analysis of convergence 
	showed that B significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related 
	to the autonomic nervous systemdizziness and vomiting as well as 
	behavior changespoor mental performance decreased social interaction
  	Anxiety depression and water retention were not improved by B 
	supplementation

Vitamin B is below the RDA for both American men and women  Birth control 
pills and over  different drugs increase the B requirement in man  
Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with  mg of B per 
day  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear  Dr David R 
Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in 
Clin Psychiatry News December  as stating that B should be 
considered the firstline drug for PMSover progesterone and if the 
patient does not respond then other treatments should be tried  Vitamin 
B can be toxicnerve damage if consumed in doses of mg or more each 
day 


	VITAMIN E Experimental Doubleblind Study Efficacy of alpha
	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome J Reprod 
	Med   pts received IU vitamin E daily for  
	cycles or a placebo  Vitamin E treated pts had  who reported a 
	significant reduction in physical symptomsweight gain and breast 
	tenderness while the placebo group had  who reported a significant
 	reduction in physical symptoms The vitamin E group reported that  
	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus  for the placebo 
	group  For depression the vitamin E group had  with a significant
	decrease in depression compared with  for the placebo group

	Experimental Doubleblind Study The effect of alphatocopherol on 
	premenstrual symptomalogy A double blind study J Am Coll Nutr 
	 pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly 
	received vitamin E at IU IU or IU daily or placebo  After 
	 months of supplementation IU of vitamin E or higher significantly 
	improved PMTA and PMTC  The IU dose was needed to significantly 
	improve PMTD  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMTH
	other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve 
	PMTH symptoms
	
	MAGNESIUM Experimental Doubleblind Study Magnesium prophylaxis 
	of menstrual migraine effects on itracellular magnesium Headache 
	  pts with perimenstrual headache received  mg 
	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a 
	placebo  Treatment was started on the th day of the cycle and 
	continued until menstruation After  months the Pain Total Index 
	was significantly lower in the magnesium group  Magnesium treatment 
	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual 
	Distress Questionnaire scores  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  
	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower 
	in this group of  pts compared to control women who did not suffer 
	from PMS  After treatment magnesium levels in these cells was raised 
	into the normal range

	Experimental Doubleblind Study Oral Magnesium successfully 
	relieves premenstrual mood changes Obstet Gynecol  
	pts aged  randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 
	mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the th day of the cycle to the 
	onset of the menstrual flow  After  cycles both groups received 
	magnesium  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster 
	pain was significantly reduced during the second cyclemonth for the 
	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were 
	switched to magnesium supplementation  In addition the total score on 
	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by 
	magnesium supplementation  The authors suggest that magnesium 
	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes 
	that occur during PMS

There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the 
medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder 
that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature  But 
since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci Med 
to be anecdotal in nature I have not bothered to cite them  There are 
also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on 
multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS  I've chosen the 
best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out 
that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder  But doctors don't recognize 
nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathologyberiberi 
pellagra scruvy etc  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor 
being trained in the US should get a good course on human nutrition  PMS 
is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional 
disorders  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses

Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitaminmineral 
supplementation andor diet change in preventing PMS

	Experimental Study Effect of a nutritional programme on 
	premenstrual syndrome a retrospective analysis Complement Med 
	Res  pts were given dietary instructions and 
	supplemented with OptiviteR plus additional vitamin C vitamin E 
	magnesium zinc and primrose oil  The dietary instructions were to 
	take the supplements and switch to a low fat complex carbohydrate 
	diet  On a retrospective analysis  of the pts reported an 
	improvement in their PMS symptoms with  of the sample stating that 
	they no longer suffered from PMS

When I was a school boy my biology teacher told us of an incident
in which a couple were very passionate without actually having
sexual intercourse  Somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm
cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation

Was my biology teacher misinforming us or do such incidents actually
occur

Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg  There is only one way for
pregnancy to occur intercourse  These days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques but we're speaking of
natural acts here  It is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is
deposited just outside of the vagina ie coitus interruptus but that's
about at far as you can get  Through clothes  no way  Better go talk
to your biology teacher

Hi
	I'm an avid dieter and the new miracle drug seems to involve thermo
genics The drug is claimed to stimulate the brown fat to burn food 
creating eat as opposed to the fat being stored There are all sorts of
warnings about fevers elevated blood pressure and heart rate ect
	The silver lining is that apparently some weight loss does not 
require a change in diet Is this possible Are the pills dangerous or just
hoaxes

Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine or the two in
combination can reduce the body's ability to make use of 
available water  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike
recently becoming dehyrated after about  hours of rigorous
hiking despite having brought   gallons of water c  liters
I drank close to twice as much as anyone else and no one else was
dehydrated  I don't think general physical condition was an issue
since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general
stamina so far as I could tell

It may be that I just plain need more water than most people  But I am
wondering if theophylline andor ephedrine might be aggravating things
I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma
 mg ephedrine  mg theophylline  I gather that both those
drugs are diuretics  So now I'm wondering does that mean they can
reduce the body's ability to utilize available water  Would it be a
particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hotweather
exercise  I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot but
that wasn't the case yesterday

 Does anyone here know anything about chelation therapy using EDTA  My
 uncle has emphesema and a doctor wants to try it on him  We are
 wondering if
 
   Is there any evidence EDTA chelation therapy is beneficial for his
 condition or any condition
 
   What possible side effects are there  How can they be mimimized
 
 Please respond via email to    rmecornelledu
 
 Thanks
 Renee

EDTAchelation therapy has been used by some physicians to try to remove 
calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial systemnot approved for such 
use  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung 
disease has become calcifiedchest xrays would show this  There are side
effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calciumit also 
binds other minerals  I think that there have been some deaths when 
EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that 
were not detected and corrected  In animal studies the best way to remove 
calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C 
and magnesiumrabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C the extra 
vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium 
from the plaques

The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably 
can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form  Most patietns 
with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium

	 Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease A review
	   Am J Clin Nutr   Supplementation with 
	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels 

	 The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular 
	    disease Am Heart J   The need to measure the 
	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be 
	    overemphasized  This is a review article

	 Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis 
	   in cholesterolfed rabbits Atherosclerosis   
	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of 
	   plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had  by weight cholesterrol

Since EDTA will also bind magnesium I've never really liked it's use for 
the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients

are in a different class  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to 
use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that could be due 
to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics
 
 I guess I'm still not clear on what the term candida bloom means
 but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal
 infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use
 This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack
 diagnosis that has been being discussed
 
 
found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida  Women have been known 
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a 
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and 
not give give her advise to use the OTC antifungal creams
 
 Lucky how  Since a recent article randomized controlled trial of
 oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis I've mentioned to a 
 number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
 could try eating  ounces of yogurt daily  It turns out most would
 rather just use antifungal creams when they get yeast infections
 
yogurt dangerous  If this were a standard part of medical practice as 
Gordon R says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline
 
 Again this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and
 has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed
 There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with
 bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in
 reducing diarrhea but I don't think anyone would view this as a
 quack therapy
  
 David Rind

Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L bulgaricus  L 
acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily 
responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free  Most of 
the commercial yogurt sold in the US has a very low L acidophilus and L 
bulgaricus count  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are 
much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem  Gordon R has told 
me through email that he gives his patients L acidophilus and several 
different obligate anaerobeswhich setup shop in the colon but he hasn't 
told me which ones yet  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative 
anaerobes and will setup shop where they have access to oxygen if given a 
chancemouth anus sinus cavity and vagina  Having these good bacteria 
around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal 
region or the vagina  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida 
blooms  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from 
the evil yeast blooms in the body  I'm not ready to buy that yet  I do 
believe that complications at specific sitesvagina anal and maybe lower 
colon sinus and mouth can result from antibiotic use which removes the 
competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked
Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best wayin my opinion to get 
rid of the problem  Antifungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A 
supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the 
good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the 
pH to basically starve the candida out

to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics  Gorden 
Rubenfeld through email has assured me that most physicians recognize 
the chance of candida blooms occuring after broadspectrum antibiotic use 
and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to 
restore competetion for candida in the body  I do not believe that this is 
yet a standard part of medical practice  
 
   Nor is it mine  What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly
 understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections
  which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections 
 Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and
 biochemists  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns
 this At some centers preop liver transplant patients receive bowel
 decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt
 to prevent fungal colonization in this soontobe high risk group  I also
 use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may
 be in part due to alterations in gut flora  However it is NOT part of
 my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after
 antibiotics  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating
 fungal infections in at risk patients  Whether or not it is a logical
 extension from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who
 base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of
 clinical trials 
   One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly
 recalcitrant cases of C difficile colitis NOT a fungal infection There
 are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate
 the patients flora  Don't try this at home 
 
not give give her advise to use the OTC antifungal creams  Since candida 
colonizes primarily in the anorectal area GI symptoms should be more common 
than vaginal problems after broadspectrum antibiotic use
 
   Except that it isn't At least symptomatically apparent disease
 
Medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way  There 
has always been the use of conventional wisdom  A very good example is 
kidney stones  Conventional wisdombecause clinical trails have not been 
done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the 
intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones 
from forming  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to 
breakdown the stone once it formed  Through the recent New England J of 
Medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong 
increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is 
restricting calcium intake
 
   Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal
 conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical
 trial like 
 
 AU   DismukesWE  WadeJS  LeeJY  DockeryBK  HainJD
 TI   A randomized doubleblind trial of nystatin therapy for the
      candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments
 SO   NEnglJMed   Dec     P 
      psychological tests RESULTS The three activetreatment regimens
      and the allplacebo regimen
      significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms P less than
       but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms
      significantly more than placebo     
      CONCLUSIONS In women with presumed candidiasis
      hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or
      psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo Consequently
      the empirical recommendation of longterm nystatin therapy for such
      women appears to be unwarranted
 
   Does this trial address every issue raised here no  Jon Noring was not
 surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use Sporanox despite
 Crook's recommendation for Nystatin  Maybe they didn't avoid those
 carbohydrates    
 
The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to 
be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy
If it makes sense for livestock why doesn't it make sense for humans 
David  We are not talking about a dangerous treatmentunless you consider 
yogurt dangerous  If this were a standard part of medical practice as 
Gordon R says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline
 
   Marty you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric
 itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic
 hypersensitivity symptoms Noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin
 therapy of undocumented candida enteritis Elaine Palmer syndrome with
 systemic symptoms  There is significant difference between the cost and
 risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials  Are we talking about real
 candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy
 of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally
 effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm
 an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc  We can't seem to
 focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion 
           
                            I'm lost

Candida can do that to you   Gordon I think that the best clinical 
trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal 
candida blooms L Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the 
frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the 
candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L acidophilus 
should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the 
intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to 
oxygenjust like it does in the vagina  As much stuff as there is in the 
lay press about L acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections I'm really 
amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out


The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all 
conventional wisdom out the window  Where would medicine be if 
conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard 
medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials
The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical sceneand a very 
important one  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria 
after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason 
to dismiss it outofhand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply 
and safelylike it is in animal husbandry

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause
pregnancy even in the presence of a hymen I doubt that sperm could make 
it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum
but it might be possible

So it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant
Also some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow nearnormal intercourse
without rupturing The problem when investigating these phenomenae is
of course getting an honest account of what exactly happened

You need to use your shoulder muscles to push the mower If you haven't been
doing much exercise as I suppose you haven't then a constant  minute
long effort can cause stiffness and cramps

County and Municipal Employees

 Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces AFSCME Other Unions
Commemorate Workers Memorial Day
 To National Desk Labor Writer
 Contact Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State County
and Municipal Employees AFLCIO 

   WASHINGTON April   The American Federation of State 
County and Municipal Employees AFSCME and other unions
of the AFLCIO on Wednesday April  will commemorate the fifth
annual Workers Memorial Day  a day to pay homage to the 
million workers who are killed injured or diseased on the job
   This year AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an
the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work
Earlier this month an AFSCME corrections officer Robert
Vallandingham was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections
facility in Lucasville Ohio
   The law and order agenda of the s has resulted in a steady
increase in the prison population for the past five years  On
Jn   the prison population was  Projections
show a continued increase in the number of inmates with an
expected prison population of  in 
   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has
created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the
number of assaults by inmates against staff  Assaults against
staff increased dramatically between  and  and remain
high  In  there were  assaults by inmates against staff
compared to  such assaults in 
   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous
combination of overcrowding and understaffing  For example in Ohio
officertoinmate ratio is  to   the second worst ratio in
the nation The national average is  to   Other health and
safety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS Hepatitis
B tuberculosis stress and chemical hazards
   AFSCME has more than  members who work in the nation's
federal state and local correctional facilities
   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under
lifethreatening conditions  Every year  American workers
die from jobrelated injuries and tens of thousands more die from
occupational disease  Public employees do some of the nation's
most dangerous jobs Perilous occupations include

    Highway Workers  Highway workers are often injured and
      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are
      not barricaded or don't have proper lighting
    Health Care Workers  Hospitals have the highest number of
      jobrelated injuries and illnesses of any private sector
      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth  There were more
      than  jobrelated illnesses and injuries in private
      sector hospitals in  up almost  percent over the
      previous year  It is generally believed that health care
      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes
      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses
      than do their private sector counterparts  Health and safety
      issues facing health care workers include exposure to
      tuberculosis and the HIV virus back injuries and high
      levels of stress
    Social Workers  Social workers who work in mental health
      institutions are often the victims of assaults and
      sometimes fatal attacks  For instance last October a man
      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler
      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn NY
      and fatally shot social services workers before turning the
      gun on himself  There are two basic problems  First is a
      growing lack of support services for people who don't have
      the help they need  Because workers are overworked some
      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling
      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated
      The quality of the clients is also becoming more violent
      as more are moved out of the institutions

   Nearly  million workers have been killed by workplace hazards
since OSHA was passed  Moreover as AFSCME President Gerald W
McEntee explains OSHA does not provide workplace safety
protections for public employees
   More than  public employees are killed each year on the
job yet  states still provide no federallyapproved OSHA
coverage for public employees said McEntee  This despite the
fact that public employees  highway workers health care workers
corrections officers to name but a few  do some of the most
dangerous work in our society  This year we are fighting for
passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater
rights and protections and finally guarantee all public employees
safe workplaces  We need the public support to be successful
   Government workers suffer  percent more injuries than private
sector workers and these injuries are almost  percent more
severe
   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed
in  and today public employees in more than half the states
have no OSHA coverage

                           I'm lost

Point 

I'm beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the whole
yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings
of words  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon
necessary for precise communication within their field which I'm fully
cognizant of since I too speak jargonese when with my peers  For the
situation in scimed many times the words or phrases used by doctors can
have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the
world at large causing significant miscommunication  One example word
and very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemic
It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific much
more so than its meaning to a nondoctor  There is also the observation of
this newsgroup that both doctors and nondoctors come together on essentially
equal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fan
the flames  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get
really beat up by nondoctors for their views on medicine which they
otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional
difficult patient

Point 

I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not
prescribe any treatmentstherapies for their patients unless such treatments
have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from wellconstructed
clinical trials usually doubleblind or that such treatmentstherapies are
part of an approved and funded clinical trial  To these doctors to do any
differently would in this belief system be unethical practice  And it
follows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a non
therapy  it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis or
theory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation
of what is currently known  Anecdotal evidence has no value either from
a treatment pointofview

And by and large as a scientist myself I am glad that medical practice
science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment  However as
also being a human being last I checked and having been one of those people
that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment where
standard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back and
wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is in
itself unethical from humanitarian considerations  After all the underlying
intent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health of
the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so the
patient should come first when considering treatment

What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both
the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints  In an earlier post I
outlined a crazy idea for doing just that  The gist of it was to give any
physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe
alternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidence
for patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted
and not until then  The patient would be fully informed that such
therapiestreatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that
there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived
from them

This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor  It also satisfies
the humanitarian needs of the patient  And the reality is that many patients
who have reached a deadend in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted
medicine will go outside the orthodox medical community  either to the
doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing
their license or worse to nondoctors who have not had the proper medical
training  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control
more within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleaned
could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most
productive way  Everybody wins in this admittedly rosecolored approach  I'm
sure there are real problems with this approach as well  it is presented
more as a strawman to stimulate discussion

Hopefully what I write here may give the scimed doctors a better idea as to
why I am open to alternative therapies as well as why I have real
difficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the  pure
scientific approach to medicine  I believe the best approach to medical
treatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with and
by the scientific aspects  Anything else is just not good medicine imho
Just my 'NF' leanings I guess

Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg  There is only one way for
pregnancy to occur intercourse  These days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques but we're speaking of
natural acts here  It is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is
deposited just outside of the vagina ie coitus interruptus but that's
about at far as you can get  Through clothes  no way  Better go talk
to your biology teacher

 what is the likely hood of conception if sperm is deposited just outside
the vagina  ie   chance
 

Hmmm I really don't know  Probably quite low overall  Why don't we
get a couple hundred willing couples together and find out

Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are 
much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem

THE diarrhea problem  WHAT diarrhea problem  First candidal overgrowth is
not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy and not all cases of
antibioticrelated diarrhea have anything to do with candida  But a case
of vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy isn't going
to surprise anyone either  That's not what people are disagreeing with

Antifungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A 
supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the 
good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the 
pH to basically starve the candida out

Oh really  Where'd you come up with this  You know it's really
appalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters
in a bizarre synthesis from reading reports in the literature
Bobbing for citations in the research literature isn't medicine
I hope you're not giving the wrong idea to your medical students

         Hello

         Just one quick question
         My father has had a back problem for a long time and doctors
         have diagnosed an operation is needed Since he lives down in
         Mexico he wants to know if there is a hospital anywhere in
         the United States particulary famous for this kind of surgery
         kind of like Houston has a reputation for excellent doctors
         in eye surgery Any additional info or pointers will be
         appreciated a whole lot

There is one hospital that is here in New York City that is famous for its
orthopedists namely the Hospital for Special Surgery They are located on
the upper east side of manhattan If you want their address and phone let
me know i'll get them i dont know them off hand

III  NEWS FROM THE WIRES 

Sender Jonathan Lord jmlsuvapcmailvirginiaedu
Subject RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC
Date Thursday April  

ATLANTA UPI    A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly
emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's
health care system federal health officials said Thursday

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting its latest
findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that
sickened hundreds in  states and killed at least four said it will
put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases

Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled Emerging
Infectious Diseases to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity  Mortality
Weekly Report which has a wide circulation in the health community
The issue also will top the agenda of a twoday meeting of scientific
counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing
threat of infectious ailments

This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility
to deal with it said Dr Ruth Berkelman deputy director of the CDC's
National Center for Infectious Diseases

There were more cases of malaria in the US in  than in any year
since the s and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic
the first in this century she said

Resistance of diseasecausing agents to antibiotics is also a problem
We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past
Berkleman said  She said even common ear infections frequently seen in
children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment

Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases
would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases
remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness
and death in the United States the CDC said

It  cited  the  emergence since the s of a myriad of newly
identified pathogens and syndromes such as Escherichia coli OH a
deadly bacterial infection the hepatitis C virus HIV the virus that
causes AIDS Legionnaires disease Lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome

The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control
such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis have increased in many areas
the CDC said  It said efforts at control and prevention have been
undermined by drug resistance

HEADLINE LymeDisease Ruling Raises Liability Issues

The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause
damage legal liability

A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not
doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much
attention as the latest medical study on the disease a flulike
illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in
rare instances death The decision last week has put property owners
on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from
the ticksthey also may have to protect themselves from litigation if
someone becomes infected while on the property

The decision by US District Judge Robert J Ward in New York came
after a weeklong trial in a case involving four track workers for the
Long Island Railroad Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the
disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job He ordered
the New York stateowned commuter line to pay the workers more than
 to compensate for pain and suffering in addition to medical
expenses and lost wages

Summer camps schools companies with facilities in rural or
semirural areas and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the
groups that need to be worried about this ruling says Stephen L
Kass an attorney at New York law firm Berle Kass  Case who wrote a
legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential
liability Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard
barbecue might be potentially liable

Lawsuits for insect bites while rare aren't unheardof A summer
vacationer in Southampton NY last year sued the owner of the home
she rented claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky
Mountain spotted fever In  also on Long Island a jury ordered
an outdoor restaurant to pay more than  million to a patron who was
stung by a bee causing an allergic reaction and permanent
quadriplegia The judge later threw out the award citing no evidence
that a beehive was near the restaurant

But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the
country  it's most prevalent in New England the Middle Atlantic
states Wisconsin Minnesota and the Northwest  may make this
particular insect bite a particularly litigious one

The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the
courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will
cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not
diagnosing the disease

Lawyers say worker'scompensation claims related to Lyme disease
have become common in some states in recent years Payments in
worker'scompensation cases however are limited to medical costs and
lost earnings

The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more
lucrative avenue for damages because it involved the question of
negligence Unlike the worker's compensation process the law governing
injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and as a
result for additional payments for pain and suffering Property
owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many
other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the
disease

Ira M Maurer a partner at New York law firm Elkind Flynn 
Maurer who represented the rail workers says the decision will help
to establish the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect
against Lyme disease

Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision winning a
lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult For
one thing victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when
and where they got the tick bite Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs
in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned
by the railroad even though none of the men remembered being bitten
The workers who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to
the insects said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded
some work sites

A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that
the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is
considering an appeal The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding
that it didn't do enough to protect employees The spokeswoman says
the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special
pants to protect against bug bites

Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up
some legal defenses for property owners such as questioning whether a
victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness
Earlier this week the Journal of the American Medical Association
reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease
And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical
disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes

Because of health and safety concerns some groups and companies
already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease Last
year at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes NJ Becton Dickinson 
Co began using Damminix a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc of Boston
that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease The medical
supply company's headquarters include a acre park and the company
was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might
get infected

Ruth Lister a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in
Indianapolis says that many youth camps accredited by her
organization also have begun to check children for ticks And Carole
Katz a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners
Association says her group spends  each year to treat their
acre site off the coast of New York with the tickkilling
pesticide



TITLE Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease
AUTHORS Chancellor MB McGinnis DE Shenot PJ Kiilholma P Hirsch IH
Department of Urology Jefferson Medical College Thomas Jefferson
University Philadelphia Pennsylvania
REFERENCE J Urol  Jan   

Lyme disease which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is
associated with a variety of neurological sequelae  We describe  patients
with neuroborreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction
Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in  patients and
detrusor areflexia in   Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not
noted on electromyography in any patient  We observed that the urinary tract
may be involved in  respects in the course of Lyme  disease  voiding
dysfunction may be part of neuroborreliosis and  the spirochete may
directly invade the urinary tract  In  patient bladder infection by the
Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy  Neurological and urological
symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was
protracted  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological
deficits were common  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme
disease need to be aware of B burgdorferi infection in the differential
diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction  Conservative bladder
management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic
evaluation is recommended

Can men get yeast infections Spread them What kind of symptoms

My ENT doctor told me that it is not uncommon for the wife to get a vaginal
yeast infection after the husband takes antibiotics  In fact this recently
happened to my wife  Explanation is that the antibiotics kill the yeast's
competition they then thrive and increased yeast around the penis spread
the infection during intercourse  I was on ceclor for  days then my wife
got the yeast

Does the Proventil inhaler for asthma relief fall into the steroid

Nonsteroid  Proventil is a brand of albuterol a bronchodilator

 hi all Ive applied for the class of  at quite a number of schools 
 and have gotten  rejects  interviews and  no responses

Three possible results after interview
 rejection outright
 acceptance outright
 the infamous 'wait list' 

If you are on a 'wait list' your entrance into medical school
is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their
acceptance  This can happen as late as day  of starting
classes  

 Any one know when the heck these people send out their acceptance letters
 According to the med school admissions book theyre supposed to send out
 the number of their class in acceptances by mid March Whats going on I
 am losing my sanity checking my mailbox every day

You can always call the admissions office  The secretaries
should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your
application  Be calm respectful and friendly secretaries
have more power than you might realize and you never know
could be the dean of admissions answering the phone

 Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in i

If you don't get in this year sit down and reevaluate
yourself your motives desires and goals that are directing
you into medicine your academic and extracurricular
accomplishments  Make a decision about whether you really
want to be a medical doctor  I had classmates who dropped out
in the first semester of med school because they found it was
not what they wanted to do I have friends who applied four
years in a row before they were accepted  Medicine as a
career is a choice you must make for yourself DON'T be
pushed into it because of your parentsfamilysignificant
other  

If you still want to be a medical doctor determine how you
can improve your application  A letter of recommendation from
a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive
recommendation is far better than one from a 'bigshot' famous
professor who only vaguely remembers your face  Also don't
be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest
and positive recommendation give them a chance to say 'no
sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no sorry'  I
have turned down writing recommendations for some students
because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful
comments and some because I honestly could not recommend them
at that point  

Rewrite your personal statement take it by an English
professor or some other friendly person with skill and
experience in writing and proofreading and get their
criticism both about what you are saying as well as how you
say it

Review your academic accomplishments  If your grades are poor
in some area don't be afraid to spend some time in further
coursework  Evidence of determined committment will help
here  If you filled your premedicine curriculum with gut
courses it usually shows

Look at your extracurricular involvements  Participating in
local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus
substantial leadership roles in an organization help also
Beware of 'resume padding' such things are not difficult to
spot and weed out

Overall a clear conception of where you wish to head and why
you want to get there combined with an honest selfappraisal
of skills and aptitude will be the best path to take in
applying to any program medical or whathaveyou

Good luck with the process  as Tom Petty says 'the waiting
is the hardest part' at least emotionally

My ENT doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses  I have a very deviated
nasal septum probably the result at least partially from several fractures
One side has approximately  of normal flow  Of course I have known this
for years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection
discovered during an MRI after a severe migraine  A CT scan subsequently 
confirmed the problems in the sinuses

He wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid maxillary frontal
and sphenoid along with nasal septoplasty

He explained the procedure and the risks  What I would like to know is if
there is anyone out there who can tell me I had this surgery and it helped
me

I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't
really help them

I am a moderately severe asthmatic  ENT doc says large percentage see some
relief of their asthma after sinus surgery  Also he said it is not unheard of
that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved

I am 

Any relevant information is appreciated

I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in   There 
is a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in the
groin  The bullet after passing through one of his testes then entered
the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby  Later  when she a young
woman of unimpeachible virtue was shown to be pregnant the soldier did
the honorable thing of marrying her  According to this story they lived
happily ever after  
Perhaps the most famous of Mr Rau's classes was the time he would come
into class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  tapering from about
 to  over a  inch length  He would say Boys do you know
what this is  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's
used to unclog your penis when you have VD  They just ram it up there
without an anesthetic  Needless to say this had a chilling effect
I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour  Later in life
as I perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible
urethral sounds that are actually used I could not escape thinking
that I might one day see Reamer Cock style of Rau

 MSG is common in many food we eat including Chinese though some oriental

 a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards  This happens to many
 of my friends and relatives too  And heh we eat Chinese food all the
 time at home  but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves

        Heck I seem to feel like that every time I eat out Including 
in the cafeteria at work About half the time the headache intensifies 
until nothing will make it go away except throwing up Ick

        As you might imagine I don't eat out a lot I guess my tolerance 
for food additives has plummeted since I switched to eating mostly 
steamed veggies They're easy to fix that's all

It isn't bogus  I had chronic vaginal yeast infections that would go away
with cream but reappear in about  weeks  I had been on  rounds of
antibiotics for a resistant sinus infection and my husband had been on
amoxicillin also for a sinus infection  After six months of this I went
to a gynecologist who had me culture my husband seminal fluid  After 
days incubation he had quite a bit of yeast growth it was confirmed by
the lab  A round of Nizerol for him cleared both of us

 I need information on the medical including emotional  pros and
 cons of circumcision at birth 

I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues
such as this  This issue has been rehashed in scimed time and
time again  The bottom line is this in normal circumstances
both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of
circumcision are minor  This means that the decision is left to
the religious cultural ethical and aesthetic mores of the
parents at best or to the habit of the concerned hospital or
caregivers at worst 

As prospective parents you should do what you want in this
regard and not worry about it too much  In terms of decisions
you make for your child it will have far less importance than
many  such as which schools you choose  that most parents
think about only a little 

This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who
feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a
momentous medical decision  It is not

Secondly your description sounds just like dinitrophenol  This is an
uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation  Put in layman's
terms it shortcircuits the mitochondria causing food energy to be
turned into heat

DNP was popular in the 's for weight reduction  In controlled
amounts it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the
reduced amount of useful energy available  It is very dangerous
It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form rather than
play around with DNP

But if you insist I suggest you look up the literature in your own
university library  You can obtain DNP by taking a first year
organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies it's

I've mentioned this study a couple of times now Ingestion of yogurt
containing Lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal
vaginitis Annals of Internal Medicine    Do you
have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than
capsules of lactobacillus even though it had positive results

The study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of  ounces of
yogurt  There was a marked decrease in infections while women were
ingesting the yogurt  Problems with the study included very small
numbers  patients enrolled and many protocol violations only
 patients were analyzed  Still the difference in rates of infection
between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly
believable

can harm the unborn fetus Does anybody know about it Is it a problem to 
have a cat in the same apartment

The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis  It is a protozoan that 
lives and multiplies within cells  In cats the protozoan multiplies in the
intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces  The protozoa can
cross the placenta to infect the fetus  The disease may be asymptomatic
after the baby is born or it may be very severe  Toxo may cause blindness
and mental retardation

Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem however pregnant
women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox  In addition whoever
does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash hisher hands before handling
anything else especially food

Information came from The Merck Manual th Ed

I hope this information is helpful to you

This request goes out to medical students who have done
or are planning to sit the USMLE or National Boards Part 

My wife is sitting this examination in early June this year and would
like to have a look at some old National Boards Part  questions
found in the following books These books are currently out of print
 

The books are

 Retired NBME Basic Medical Science Test Items NBME
    Published by NBME in 

 Selftest in the Part  Basic Medical Sciences NBME
    Published by NBME in 

I would appreciate if anyone who has these books is willing
to loan it to her for a couple of days Obviously I would
reimburse for you all postage and related charges Failing
that it would be beneficial if anyone could point to any
library in the NY NJ or PA area that may have these books

Please respond by email since I do not read this newsgroup

Need info on Circumcision medical cons and pros

In article CyGtHcsuiucedu Gunnar Blix blixmiltoncsuiucedu
writes
I need information on the medical including emotional  pros and
cons of circumcision at birth  I am especially interested in
references to studies that indicate disadvantages or refute studies
that indicate advantages  A friend who is a medical student is
writing a survey paper and apparently the studies she has run into
are all for circumcision the main argument being a lower risk of
penile cancer

Please email responses as I am not a frequent reader of either group
I will summarize to the net

I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision
of newborn males on the population Since your friend is not a man she
can't imagine what it's like to have a penis much less a foreskin I
guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance

The penile cancer thing has been completely debunkedshe must be
going to school on a South Pacific island Tell her to check the Journal
or Urology for circumcision articles I remember at least  on an old
Jewish man cut at birth who developed penile cancerI mean if the
cancer risk was that great the Europe who have been circumcising like
crazy too Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue a
little proper hygiene goes a long way  Americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it that's just way too much like
mastubation So you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary

 UNLESS I plan on getting sick  I won't eat the stuff without my
 Seldane  And did I ever learn to read labels

  it might not please a medical researcher  but it pleased my own
 personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine 
 
Allergy medicine huh  Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or
whatever or does it actually suppress allergic reactions ie like an
antihistamine does  As far as doctors over here are concerned if you slip up
and eat something you're allergic to even if they won't test you to tell you
what to avoid then tough if a cheap medicine will alleviate your symptoms
then fine otherwise you just suffer  One doctor did prescribe me imigran costs
the NHS  for  tablets after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwing
up for four solid days and couldn't even drink water  but I got taken off it
again when I moved and had to change doctors  Reasoning they did not know what
the sideeffects were because it was new  OK fine  but it has passed the
safety tests to get on the prescription list and anyway I was prepared to take
the risk to have quality of life now  The only alternatives I have is to get it
prescribed privately which I cannot afford or to pay a private allergy
specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid  I am fairly certain I am
allergic to more than one chemical additive as a lot of things I can't eat have
nothing in common except things I know are safe so testing myself isn't really
an option there are too many permutations

 I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG  I've noticed that I
 have a certain tolerance level  like a small bag of bbq chips once
 a month or so it not a problem  but that same bag of chips will
 bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of
 the Chinese restaurants the day before  

Yes I've noticed that  and I can work it up by eating just under the tolerance
level fairly regularly  If I don't eat anything except home cooking for a month
or so I lose it and have to work it up from scratch a bad experience  Now I
know what the earlywarning symptoms are though I can usually tell whether I am
allergic to food before I've eaten too much of it usually

GregFlame definitely intended here  Bill was making fun of the misspelling 
Go look up the word krill  Also the correct spelling is Kirlian  It
involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a highvoltage source not of some aura  It works equally well
with inanimate objects

True but what about showing the missing part of a leaf  Is this
corona discharge

Yup  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates and taking a Kirlian photograph of it  You then cut off part of
the leaf put the top plate back on and take another Kirlian photograph  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases  Turns out the effect isn't
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity  Surprise surprise

I saw this a few years ago on Tomorrow's World lowbrow BBC
technology news program  The patient is lowered into a bath of
deionized water and carefully positioned  High intensity pressure
waves are generated by an electric spark in the water you don't get
electrocuted because deionised water does not conduct  These waves are
focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to
break up  This is completely painless

Of course you then have to get these little bits of gravel through

Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly  Does 
shortterm use of the drug ever produce longterm sideeffects after
the use of the drug  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized
and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks  Although the
drug has been terminated she has changed from a perky slightly
senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone
and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance  It
seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the
course of just one and onehalf months  I have to believe that the
combination of the hospital stay and some drugs are in part
catalysts for this  Any comments

 I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
 demented during hospital stays In the examples I've seen drugs were
 definitely involved 

 My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
 hospital He was fiftythree at the time and he was on  separate
 medications The family protested but the doctors were adamant telling
 us that none of the drugs interact They even took the attitude that if
 he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well With
 the help of an MD friend of the family we had all his medication
 discontinued He had a seizure that night and was put back on one drug
 Two days later he was his old self again I guess there aren't many
 medical texts that address the subject of way interactions

I saw the same thing happen to my father and I can more or less validate your
take on hospitals  It seems to me that medical science understands precious
little about taking care of the human machine  Drugs are given as a
response to symptoms and I guess that makes sense since all the studies that 
validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow
assessment of the degree of particular symptoms  But there seems
to be very little appreciation for the wellbeing of a person
outside of the numbers that appear on a test  I watched my dad
wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue
while in the hospital  There is something a little crazy about a
system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every
latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you
have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue  It is
really really bizarre

FLAME ON

Reading through the posts about Kirlian whatever spelling
photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the
narrowminded I know it all I don't believe what I can't see or
measure attitude of many people out there

I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to
socalled paranormal stuff but as far as I'm concerned it is just
as likely as the existence of for instance a god which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies  without any scientific basis

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something ANYTHING simply because it doesn't fit your current frame
of reference History shows that many great people great scientists
were people who kept an open mind  and were ridiculed by sceptics

Especially the USA should be grateful after all Columbus did not
drop off the edge of the earth

FLAME OFF or end sermon

Dear Netters

Maybe one of you can explain this  From time to time I experience 
a strange kind of feeling I have all kinds of weird feelings which 
can be best described as the feeling of losing gravity like that one 
experiences in a descending elevator  Needless to say it is not 
enjoyable  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme 
fatigue  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts 
that long it makes me sweatening

Initially I called it palpitation spelling until I later learnt that 
the terminology has been reserved for the selfawareness of heart beats

So is there a specific term for this feeling or am I a stragne person
I always believe I am unique 

Thanks

Ping

but what about women 

For example might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for
say cervical cancer  Adverse effects from sperm antibodies  Changes in the

Outside of study results how about informed speculation

I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better  I applied
to about  schools got two interviews got one offer and am waiting to
hear from the other school

Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical
school admissions process  Numbers GPA MCATs are not everything 
but they are probably more important than anything else  In fact some
schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look
at your other qualities  Of course when this happens don't expect a refund
on your  application fee

But the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers
and are very well qualified academically  You mentioned one response was it
an acceptance denial or waitlist  If I assume the worst that it was a
denial then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere  How
did your interviews go

As for how long you have to wait I've called a few schools who never contacted
me for anything  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was
over and that if I haven't heard by now I can assume a denial  Many rejection
letters are not sent out until May or as late as June  But some schools are
still interviewing I really don't think you should worry  Don't become
fixated on the mailbox go out have fun be very proud of yourself

What do people think of the medical school admissions process  I had a very
mediocre GPA but high MCAT scores and I have been working as a software
engineer for two years  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford  Still
I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted
is something like this

VERY IMPORTANT

GPA	 or better
MCAT   top  in all subject

MEDIUM IMPORTANCE

WritingSpeaking ability
Maturity
Motivation for going into medicine
Activities

LESS IMPORTANT

College or University
Major
Work experience
Anything else you want them to know


Anyway you are in good shape  I think admissions committees are bound in
many ways by the numbers but would like very much to understand each
person as an individual  Sometimes thats just not practical  But getting 
four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers  Hopefully you
were able to impress them with your character


Good luck
Jeff

general or regional anesthesia  Afterwards it feels like someone

 I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss A recent rough test
 showed a gently sloping loss to db down at cps Then it falls off
 a cliff to dbs down from cps on  This type of loss is difficult
 to fit I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which
 keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired
 
 Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q behind the ear aids for
 several weeks These have four independent programs which are intended to
 be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed I
 found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about
 to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of
 another programmable system called ReSound
 
 Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for
 about  minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex
 Nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and I was
 impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I
 will give in a separate posting They also carry the Widex aids and had one
 patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound
 even though he had purchased the Widex only  months ago
 
 The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the
 Widex and other programmable aids I could take a trip to Europe on the
 difference  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money I am
 having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds I would
 appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections
 about when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite
 so expensive
 
 

Your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine thanks Uncle Sam  I've been
wearing Miracle Ear canal aids for about  months now and I find them to be
acceptable  They are molded to the shape of your ear canal and tuned to 
your hearing curve  They are comfortable to wear and almost invisible if
you're worried about that although if you're currently wearing behind the
ear models that's not an issue  The cost  I paid  each for mine
through the Miracle Ear counter at Sears  I've heard that there is a
substantial discount for senior citizens but I haven't researched that because
I'm not a senior citizen yet

Give them a try you might be pleasantly surprised

oxygenjust like it does in the vagina  As much stuff as there is in the 
lay press about L acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections I'm really 
amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out
 
 I've mentioned this study a couple of times now Ingestion of yogurt
 containing Lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal
 vaginitis Annals of Internal Medicine    Do you
 have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than
 capsules of lactobacillus even though it had positive results
 
 The study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of  ounces of
 yogurt  There was a marked decrease in infections while women were
 ingesting the yogurt  Problems with the study included very small
 numbers  patients enrolled and many protocol violations only
  patients were analyzed  Still the difference in rates of infection
 between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly
 believable
  
 David Rind

David this study looks like a good one  Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline 
search and also sent me the same reference through email  Since 
commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a or 
bulgaricus culture a negative finding would not have been too informative
This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are 
recommended rather than yogurt

I guess the next question is why would this introduction of good bacteria 
back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the 
anus was not serving as a candida reservoira fact that Gordon R vehementy
denys  I see two possible theories  One the L acidophilus which is a 
facultatively anaerobic bacterium could make it through the gut and 
colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida  This would not explain 
the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion 
was stopped though  The other is that the additional bacteria in the 
intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida 
looses it's major food source

Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tractwhere it is 
normally found would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal 
yeast blooms though  An acetic acid Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has 
been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in 
the medical literature  This would be an example of physicians conducting 
their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their 
patients  When this is done in private practice the results are rarely if 
ever published  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age 
emerged with clinical trials  It really raises a big question  Does the 
medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to 
help patients or does it look the other way

This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous 
therapy is involvedeven the antifungals are not all that dangerous  But 
there are some areaslike EDTA chelation therapy where the fire is pretty 
hot and somebody could get burned  It's really tough  Do I follow only 
well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or 
do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to 
work yet

My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities especially if they 
involve little or no risk to the patient  Getting good bacteria back into 
the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility  The other 
is getting L acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a 
problem with recurring yeast infections

Yup  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates and taking a Kirlian photograph of it  You then cut off part of
the leaf put the top plate back on and take another Kirlian photograph  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases  Turns out the effect isn't
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity  Surprise surprise

	This is true but it's not quite the whole story  There were 
	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect'

    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography
    is a Theosophist and threfore presumably willing to entertain the
    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura electromagnetic
    or otherwise professor of electrical engineering at London's
    City University and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research 
    named A J Ellison

    After years of studying the method and the claims Ellison
    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we
    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures' an effect of intermittent ionization of
    the air around the object  It's a bit more complicated than
    'not wiping off the plates' but it comes down to the same thing
    in the end Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited
    value if any than was previously widely thought  Electrical and
    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be
    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and
    usually also tracer chemicals

I need information on the medical including emotional  pros and
cons of circumcision at birth  I am especially interested in
references to studies that indicate disadvantages or refute studies
that indicate advantages  A friend who is a medical student is
writing a survey paper and apparently the studies she has run into
are all for circumcision the main argument being a lower risk of
penile cancer

Please email responses as I am not a frequent reader of either group
I will summarize to the net

I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision
of newborn males on the population Since your friend is not a man she


Money probably has a lot to do with keeping the practice of routine 
circumcision alive It's another opporitunity to charge a few hundred
extra bucks for a completely unnecessary procedure the rationale for 
which until recently has been accepted without question by most
parents of newborns  

One could also imagine that complications arising from circumcision
infections sloppy jobs etc are far more common than the remote chance
of penile cancer it is purported to prevent  
 

can't imagine what it's like to have a penis much less a foreskin I
guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance

The penile cancer thing has been completely debunkedshe must be
going to school on a South Pacific island Tell her to check the Journal
or Urology for circumcision articles I remember at least  on an old
Jewish man cut at birth who developed penile cancerI mean if the
cancer risk was that great the Europe who have been circumcising like
crazy too Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue a
little proper hygiene goes a long way  Americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it that's just way too much like
mastubation So you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary

FLAME ON

Reading through the posts about Kirlian whatever spelling
photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the
narrowminded I know it all I don't believe what I can't see or
measure attitude of many people out there

Where have you seen that attitude

I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to
socalled paranormal stuff but as far as I'm concerned it is just
as likely as the existence of for instance a god which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies  without any scientific basis

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something ANYTHING simply because it doesn't fit your current frame
of reference History shows that many great people great scientists
were people who kept an open mind  and were ridiculed by sceptics

Fine jackass  Suppose you point out even ONE aspect of Kirlian photography
that's not explained by a corona discharge

Hi We are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull  The problem we are having is that we cannot obtain D data for the skull  We can just video a rotating skull but that will only give us  dimensions

Anyone out there got any suggestions

Yup you can get a skull contained in the Cyberwaredemo from the
following location

In order to get the Cyberwaredemo via ftp do the following

	 ftp tauruscsnpsnavymil
	 login as anonymous guest as the password
	 cd pubdabro
	 binary
	 get cyberwaredemotarZ

Once you get the demo onto your workstation

	 uncompress cyberwaredemotarZ
	 tar xvof cyberwaredemotar

The skull data is called 'phred' and resides in the data directory

I heard a short blurb on the news yesterday about an herb called feverfew 
that some say is good for preventing migraines I think the news said there
were two doubleblind studies that found this effective

Does anyone know about these studies Or have experience with feverfew
I'm skeptical but open to trying it if I can find out more about this
What is feverfew and how much would you take to prevent migraines if 
this is a good idea that is Are there any known risks or side effects
of feverfew

occur

Ohboy Here we go again And one wonders why the American

Actually this was a school in England  This same biology teacher also

 Hi All

 Would anyone out there in 'netland' happen to have an
 authentic surefire way of making this great sauce that
 is used to adorn Gyro's and Souvlaki

 Thanks

I have a receipe at home that was posted to me by one of our fellow
netters about a month ago  I am recalling this from memory but
I think I'm fairly close by the way it was GREAT

 	pint of plain yogurt 
	med sized cucumber finely shredded
	cloves of garlic more or less by taste
 tsp	dill weed

The yogurt is dumped into a strainer lined with a coffee
filter and allowed to drain at least  hours you can
adjust the consistancy of the sauce by increasing this time
up to  hours

The shredded cuc is drained the same way

Mix it all together and let it steep for at least
 hours it's better the next day and enjoy

Steve

I think I can explain the missing part of a leaf story

I have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirlian
photograph in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of
Kirlian photography  That particular photograph    That's
right the effect has been observed only once  Even the writers of
the book were inclined to disbelieve in it  

I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing
a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo
For his next experiment he cut the leaf in half put one half down
between the same two plates and took another K p  The
missing half effect was created by water oils etc left behind 
after the first photo

This explanation must be tentative because after all I wasn't there
when it happened

moisture left by the original whole leaf for example

This homeopathic remedies  I tried the dander one for a month  drops
three times a day  I didn't notice any change whats so ever  How long
were you using the drops before you noticed a difference

It is NOT a homeopathic remedy Improvement began in a few months

Yup  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates and taking a Kirlian photograph of it  You then cut off part of
the leaf put the top plate back on and take another Kirlian photograph  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases  Turns out the effect isn't
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity  Surprise surprise

	This is true but it's not quite the whole story  There were 
	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect'

You can also replicate the effect with a rock  Take your first Kirlian
photograph  Then moisten one edge of the rock  Lo and behold  Phantom rock

I used to be on lopid  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol 
down to around  as well as LDL and triglycerides  Then I got
pneumonia and for some reason the Lopid stopped working very well
cholesterol and triglycerides soared  The levels might have stabilized
over time but a new doctor had me quit wait a month then switch
to Mevicore  

On Mevicore my total cholesterol was down to   LDL was  
and HDL was  but the trig's were still
very high around  and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal 
SGOT   N    GGTPhard to read copy   N    

He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him
concern and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol
figures  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal Just
to be extra cautious though I'm sure it's not a problem
and wants me to go back on it after that  I suggested maybe Lopid might
be the better choice and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what
I want to do  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of

Should the above liver and trig figures be feared  What happens to
folks with high trig levels  Is my liver in danger with the above
results  Would I be better off on Lopid despite its inconvenient 
side effect or perhaps some other drug  Niacin affected my 
liver too

True but what about showing the missing part of a leaf  Is this
corona discharge

This effect disappears if you clean your apparatus after you kirlianed
the whole leaf and before kirlianing the leaf part

hi all i got several emails and a couple news replies and i guess i
shoulda went into more detail Being my anxiety level is peaking and you
folks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see what
you people think regarding my previous post
To recap i applied to  schools total  of which were MD and  DO

as it stands now i have had  rejects  interviews  MD and  DO the
results of which are  waiting lists  MD and one DO

 schools i heard nothing from at all

I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no
info whatsoever to tell me

I have taken a good mix to apply to  top schools a bunch of middles
and a few safety  funny that most of my safety schools were the first
to reject me

my index is at like a  mcats were R P B WQ and R P B WR
I couldnt get the damn reading score up i never stuff like art
history politics etc 

Ive done medical research at the undergrad level done clinical lab work
for years now but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience

I cant think of what else i left out but thats the summary What
percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average
I felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm
acceptance in my hand anyone have any suggestions as to calm the
mailbox anxiety  

If you premeds out there or med students have any questions or comments
for me feel free to send them down Typing is a form of antianxiety

 med students are

 Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization  I 
 have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like
 thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things  But I have
 never applied them to large amounts of data

 Has anyone had luck with any particular books memory systems or

 Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques  Being an
 older student who returned to school this year organization another
 one of my weak points has been a major help to my success

 Please no griping about how all you have to do is learn the material
 conceptually  I have no problem with that it is one of my strong 
 points  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is
 rote memorization  

 Thanks for your help
The only suggestion i can think of off the top of my head is get a large
supply of index cards and memorize small amounts of info at a time making
flash cards and quesitons Everytime i get a question wrong I always
manage to get the damn thing right the next time

 There is one hospital that is here in New York City that is famous for its
 orthopedists namely the Hospital for Special Surgery They are located on
 the upper east side of manhattan If you want their address and phone let
 me know i'll get them i dont know them off hand

I know in one case a year old person developed bruise at the base of her
left thumb after wearing the copper bracelet on her left wrist for several
months  She was told the bruise is normal and would disappear 

Is the bruise reason to be concerned
Should the person discontinued wearing the copper bracelet

Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the
following two health problems

First I was recently diagnosed using a UGI series as having a
Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia As I understand it
the hernia is a relatively minor problem though I do occasionally
have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it The Schatzki
ring on the other hand is causing swallowing difficulty In particular
if I'm not careful about eating slowly and thoroughly chewing food
food occasionally gets stuck before reaching my stomach This results
in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction
Fortunately the food has always managed to pass but this is annoying
and causes frequent discomfort

My doctor wants to dilate the ring using the
following procedure use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach
for any inflammation then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing
some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous I would like to know
if anyone out there has had this or a similar procedure doneif so
was it painful successful etc Also can anyone  comment on
safety advisability and success rate of this procedure Has it become
a common procedure I am kind of leery of having such an invasivesounding
procedure performed for a currently nonthreatening condition such as this
especially considering the possible side effects bleeding perforation
reaction to anesthesia

The second issue for the past  years I have had a large number
of extra heartbeats In particular during the past month or so there
has been a dramatic increasea Holter monitor recently showed  PVC's in 
hrs along with a few PAC's Many days there are far more than this
howeverfive to ten per hour All of them were isolated and the cardiologist
indicated that such a number was normal It certainly doesn't
feel normal In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of
extended runs of these beats one of which lasted long enough to cause
severe lightheadedness I am relatively young ish thin and in good
health recent bloodtests were all normal and do not smoke use drugs or
caffeine etc I'm willing to accept the extra beats as normal but don't
want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom The number
of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day and with exercise or something
as simple as climbing some stairs Also if I get up after sitting or lying
down for a while I tend to get a couple of extra beats Could they possibly
be related to the esophagous problems Both seemed to develop at about the
same time

Thanks for any helpadvice

A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones a
cyst on one kidney and a kidney infection  She was upset because her
condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall and she has been ill all
this time  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents'
HMO clinic she said that about FORTY xrays were made of her kidney
When she asked why so many xrays were being made she was told by a
technician that they need to see the area from different views but she
says that about five xrays were made from EACH angle  She couldn't help
feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something  She
is a premed student and feels she could have understood what was
happening if someone would have explained  When nobody would she got
worried
	Also she is told that thre are  surgery patients ahead of her
and that they cannot do surgery until August or so  It is now April
She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids  But she has to go to
classes  She wonders why they have given her no medicine  She plans to
call back her doctor's office  clinic and try to get answers to these
questions  But I told her I would also write in to scimed and see what I
could find out about why there were so many xrays and whether it seems
ok to wait in line  or more months for surgery for something like this
or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care  She does plan to
get a second opinion too 

	I will pass info on to her  It never hurts to get information
from more than one source  

You can email me or post

Thanks

ANNOUNCEMENT	The HyperKnowledge PROJECT for NeXTSTEP

Motivation

We are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our  
work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by  
incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages too often  
claiming to do everything  Rather than being able to use different tools  
together in a flexible interactive system we find ourselves spending too  
much time converting between different data formats writing throwaway  
tools and IO parsers and worrying about how to get to a particular goal  
rather than what it means to have attained it

What we need is an objectoriented scientific environment where the tools  
we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system  
highly interactive and extendable both by the addition of our own  
specialized objects and by combining the available tools  graphically   
The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work  
requiring a very short learning phase and practically no  
userdocumentation  The user should feel encouraged to explore different  
possibilities testing hisher own scientific ideas without worrying too  
much about whether the system is able to cope within reason of course   
By building an open and objectoriented system each user should be able  
to draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a  
particular task we all need to organize and archive our data display  
results and combine information from many different sources

Currently the group consists of people from very different fields  
Molecular Biology Computer Science Physics and Astronomy and Geography   
While many of our needs for such an environment diverge the underlying  
motivation is the same no matter what you want to call it we need a  
system which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific  
data and daily work


Why NeXTSTEP

What else is there  No other system offers the same power a totally  
objectoriented developers environment UNIXcompatibility  
highlyinteractive and standardized userinterface  With the advent of  
NS and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range  
of hardware platforms such a system will soon be nearly universally  
available  Classical workstation vendors SUN IBM HP and the rest now  
have little to offer no similar tools exist for the standard XWindows  
GUI if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware and the  
massmarket WindowsDOS world is a developer's nightmare either despite  
or more probably because of OLE

In order to progress we need an open discussion of how best to develop  
such an environment  In NeXTSTEP parlance do we simply have to put  
together a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our  
Hyperknowledge servers Should be use distributed objects  What  
minimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the  
environment  What toolneeds do we all have in common and which ones are  
best developed by specialized subgroups  How many already existing tools  
canshould be integrated into the system eg Mathematica  Do we need  
an AVSlike tool for dataflow manipulation

 New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at
Huntington Medical Research Institutes Results to Be Reported
 To National Desk Health Writer
 Contact John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber  or
           for the Huntington Medical Research
          Institutes

   LOS ANGELES April    A new method for diagnosing 
and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain
which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been
discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research
Institutes HMRI in Pasadena Calif  Results of their research
will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal
Radiology
   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging MRI
called magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS a research team led
by Brian D Ross MD D Phil conducted a study on  elderly
patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of
dementia The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special
software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS  Clinical
Proton MRS is easily applied giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses
in less than  minutes  An automated version of Clinical Proton
MRS called Proton Brain Examination PROBE reduces the examination
time yet further providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 
minutes  By comparison the current standard of care in testing
for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and
neuropsychological tests which can be very upsetting to the
patient are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy
   In addition to Alzheimer's disease the new Clinical Proton MRS
exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias including
AIDSrelated dementia Parkinson's disease and Huntington's
disease
   We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly
and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted
with either the MRS or PROBE software said Dr Ross adding
this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and
intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease
causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain
   Dr Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the
brain known as inositols and myoinositol MI acted as a marker
in the study  In comparison to healthy patients those diagnosed
with Alzheimer's showed a  percent increase in MI while their
level of another chemical called Nacetylaspartate NAA was
significantly lower indicating a loss of brainstimulating neurons
believed to be associated with the progression of the disease
   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely
considered to be inadequate  This is attributable Dr Ross
believes to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an
interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to
the nerve cells This belief has been adhered to over the last 
years and consequently most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based
on the changing receptors for acetylcholine
   Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate
Alzheimer's from other dementias to provide the patient and his or
her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment
protocols for the treatment of this disease  For this reason we
consider this test a major advancement in medicine said Bruce
Miller MD a noted neurologist at HarborUCLA MRS researcher
and a coauthor of the study
   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A Moats
PhD Truda Shonk BS Thomas Ernst PhD and Suzanne Woolley
RN  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 
General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States
and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon
   For interviews with Dr Ross advance copies of the Radiology

   Q  A on Alzheimer's Disease

   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused
   Alzheimer's disease AD is an incurable degenerative disease of
the brain first described in  by the German neuropathologist
Alois Alzheimer  As the disease progresses it leads to loss of
memory and mental functioning followed by changes in personality
loss of control of bodily functions and eventually death
   How many people does it affect
   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated  million adults in
the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death taking
approximately  lives each year  While Alzheimer's
debilitates its victims it is equally devastating both
emotionally and financially for patients' families  AD is the
most common cause of dementia in adults  Symptoms worsen every
year and death usually occurs within  years of initial onset
   What are its signs and symptoms
   Although the cause of AD is not known two risk factors have
been identified advanced age and genetic predisposition  The risk
of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 
yars old but increases steeply in each successive decade of life
to reach  percent by the age of   In patients with familial
AD immediate family relatives have a  percent chance of
developing AD  One of its first symptoms is severe forgetfulness
caused by shortterm memory loss  Dr Herman Weinreb of the School
of Medicine at New York University says whether forgetfulness is
a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree and
suggests the following criteria

    Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is
      normal
    Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious
    Forgetting where you left your keys is normal
    Forgetting how to get home is serious

   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be
evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms
of dementia

I am starting work on a project where I am trying to make strain gages
bond to bone in vivo or a period of several months  I am currently
using hydroxyapaptite back gages and I have tried Mbonding the gages
to the bone  Apart from those two application methods there doesn't
seem to be much else in the literature  I have only an engineering 
background not medical or biological  I would be interest in any
ideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone

It sounds as though you might want to try a product such as superglue
The active ingredient is cynoacrylate the same compound used to reconstruct
bones  I have successfully used superglue for a number of procedures on many
different species of animal If you are simply trying to adhear something
to bone for several months this would be ideal It bonds almost immediatly
is resistant to infection and is nonirritating to surrounding tissue

I've had the usual skin prick tests for the
common allergies but reacted to none of the substances
So for the last two seasons I've received cortisone shots
but the doctors seem reluctant to give more than two or
three shots  Why  What are the dangers

Hello a friend is under going kemotherapysp for breast cancer I'm
trying to learn what I can about it Any info would be appreciated
Thanks

You've asked a toughie of a question  There are many different drugs which
are used for chemotherapy

The overall purpose of chemotherapy don't worry about the spelling  Some of
these crazy medical words are impossible to spell  is to either destroy
cancer cells or to keep them from growing  Different drugs have different
effects on cancer cells and therefore it is not uncommon to use more than
one drug at a time

Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle
of a cell  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle

The first phase of the cell cycle is G it is when the protein synthesis
and RNA systhesis occurs  In the second phase S synthesis of DNA occurs
The third phase is G The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized 
aagain  In the fourth phase M or Mitosis the cell may divide

There are drugs which are effective in each phase  Some stop DNA synthesis
Others stop the cell from dividing Others wreck protein synthesis
At any rate the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells
to stop growing

If what you are seeking is practical advice I apologize for rambling
on the techno stuff  Some side effects are pretty common  Chemo drugs
are rather nasty  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to 
experience nausea and vomiting  Things to help this include eating small
frequent meals  It is also suggested that if nauseavomiting hereafter
known as nv occurs that the person notify the doctor there are medicines
tthat help nausea  Diarrhea can be an effect  Antidiarrheal medications 
can be given and good skincare and fluid intake are important

Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss  This does not always
happen  It depends on what drugs are being given and on the person 
themself  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different
side effects  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug
headband andor wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss presumably
by reducing blood flow to the scalp  If anyone has seen research on this
too I would love to see it and possibly some bib data

I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society
They have a vast selection of literature and information  In addition
if your friend has had a mastectomy I highly recommend Reach for Recovery
It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast 
because of cancer  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions

If you have further questions please send me Email  I hav some good
access to information and I enjoy trying to help other people

I wish the best to you and your friend

We're about to have our first baby and have a few questions that we
dont seem to be able to get answered to our satisfaction 
 
Reguarding having a baby boy circumsized what are the medical pros
and cons  All we've heard is 'its up to the parents'
 
Unfortonately that truly is about the best summation of the research
that there is  Advantages stated of circumcison included probably
prevention of penile cancer which interestingly occurs mostly in men
whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor simplicity of personal
hygiene prevention of urinary tract infections and prevention of
a unretractible foreskin  Disadvantages include infection from the 
procedure pain etc  I apologize I am trying to pull this off
the top of my head  I will post what I discovered in research I did
a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school
It really is a decision that is up to the parents  Some parents use
the reasoning that they will look like Daddy and like their friends
as justification  There is nothing wrong with this just be sure it is
what you want to do since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise
a male although a major surgical procedure exists

How about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water  We've heard 
stories of infection etc  How about after the water has broken
 
As long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any
problems with your pregnancy it should be OK to sit in a tub of water
HOWEVER I WOULD RECOMMEND USING YOUR OWN BATHTUB IN YOUR OWN HOME
It is nearly impossible to guarantee the cleanliness and safety of public
hot tubs  A nice warm bath can be very relaxing especially if your back
is killing you  And it would possibly be advisable to avoid bubble bath
soap  esp if you are prone to yeast infection

Hope these tips help you some

 Marty I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article 
 on kidney stones as gospel First of all I would want to know who
 sponsored that study
 I have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from
 local newspapers magazines to TVguide with disclaimers on the
 bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us
 compliments of the Dairy Industries
 There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive
 financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous 
 benefits of increasing one's calcium intake

 Secondly were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved 
 in that project analysed for their chemical composition  The study
 didn't say that it only claimed that most kidney stones are large
 ly calcium
 Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact
 opposite findings A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they
 are oftentimes just plain wrong It wouldn't be the first time
 
 Sodiummagnesiumcalciumphosphorus ratios are in my opinion still 
 the most reliable indicators for the cause treatment and prevention 
 of kidney stones
 I for one will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
 one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
 stones of either type and they definitely won't include an INCREASE
 in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium
 type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit
 from a PHOSPHORUSraising approach instead

Could anyone give me information on Umbilical hernias
The patient is over weight and has a protruding hernia

Surgery may be risky due to the obesity
What other remedies could I try


Unless the patient has a very short life expectancy the possible complications
from a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery
The risks of surgery anyway are minimal Unless they are exceedingly large
hernias can be fixed under local anesthesia 
Don't forget that hernias are one the leading causes of small bowel obstruction
And the smaller the hernia is the higher the chances that a loop of bowel will
become incarcerated or strangulated

What is the state of affairs about this I went to a doctor and

I believe this From now on it looks like  shots per week for
 months followed by  shot per month or so Each shot costs
 Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system I would
call that a racket We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses
here but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office
Apart from this issue I was somewhat disappointed to find out
that you have to keep getting the shots forever Is that right

Greeting

I am starting work on a project where I am trying to make strain gages
bond to bone in vivo or a period of several months  I am currently
using hydroxyapaptite back gages and I have tried Mbonding the gages
to the bone  Apart from those two application methods there doesn't
seem to be much else in the literature  I have only an engineering 
background not medical or biological  I would be interest in any
ideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone

Thanks for oyur help in Advance

Does anyone know about these studies Or have experience with feverfew
I'm skeptical but open to trying it if I can find out more about this
What is feverfew and how much would you take to prevent migraines if 
this is a good idea that is Are there any known risks or side effects
of feverfew 

Thanks in advance for any info
Brenda

I've tried it and so has one friend of mine  No known side effects or
risks  It didn't seem to work for us but several studies now have 
suggested it does work for many people so I think it's worth a try

You can find it in capsule form at health food stores  Up to six capsules
a day was recommended if I remember correctly  It can also be prepared 
as a tea

Good luck

I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't
really help them

I am a moderately severe asthmatic  ENT doc says large percentage see some
relief of their asthma after sinus surgery  Also he said it is not unheard of
that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved

Did your ENT also tell you that this procedure may remove warts from the soles
of your feet and improve your sex life

Actually severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses plugged ostia are
possible and sinus surgery which widens the ostia  from the normal 
mm to about  mm  should relieve this  There are nonsurgical ways
however to keep the ostia open however in a few individuals their
ostia are naturally very small and Dr Ivker's book talks about this
The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of
sinus surgery though

About asthma that's a little more controversial  Dr Ivker in his book
Sinus Survival speculates and says it's not proven that many cases
of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage
postnasal drip from the sinuses  He's had many patients who've found
relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated 
not clinical proof but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation

Before doing any sinus surgery first get THE BOOK  it discusses surgery
as well as a good nonsurgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis

 A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones a
 cyst on one kidney and a kidney infection  She was upset because her
 condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall and she has been ill all
 this time  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents'
 HMO clinic she said that about FORTY xrays were made of her kidney
 When she asked why so many xrays were being made she was told by a
 technician that they need to see the area from different views but she
 says that about five xrays were made from EACH angle  She couldn't help
 feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something  She
 is a premed student and feels she could have understood what was
 happening if someone would have explained  When nobody would she got
 worried
 	Also she is told that thre are  surgery patients ahead of her
 and that they cannot do surgery until August or so  It is now April
 She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids  But she has to go to
 classes  She wonders why they have given her no medicine  She plans to
 call back her doctor's office  clinic and try to get answers to these
 questions  But I told her I would also write in to scimed and see what I
 could find out about why there were so many xrays and whether it seems
 ok to wait in line  or more months for surgery for something like this
 or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care  She does plan to
 get a second opinion too 
 
 	I will pass info on to her  It never hurts to get information
 from more than one source  
 
 You can email me or post
 
 Thanks
 
 Alice

My opinionfor what it's worth is that  xrays is way too many  
Guidleines have been set on the number of dental xrays and chest xrays 
that one should have over a given period of time because of all the 
environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans ionizing radiation 
is one of the most potentsplits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical 
formation in tissue cells  Ultasoundlike that used in seeing the fetus 
in the uterus has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors 
in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder  But kidney tissue may 
be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stonesany radiologists care 
to comment

Most stones will passbut it's a very painful process  Unlike gallstones 
I don't think that there are many drugs that can help dissolve the 
kidney stonewhich is probably calciumoxalate  Vitamin C and magnesium 
have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the 
aterial wall  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could 
speed up the process of kidney stone passagebut I'm pretty confident that 
a diet change andor supplementation can prevent a reoccurance  If surgery 
is being contemplated the stone must be in the kidney tubule  A second 
opinion is a good idea because there are betterless damaging ways to break 
up the stone if it's logged within the kidneysonic blasts  HMO's are 
notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments

Can anyone out there tell me the difference between a persistent disease
and a chronic one For example persistent hepatitis vs chronic
hepatitis

I don't think there is a general distinction  Rather there are
two classes of chronic hepatitis chronic active hepatitis and chronic
persistent hepatitis  I can't think of any other disease where the
term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic

Much as these two terms chronic active and chronic persistent
sound fuzzy the actual distinction between the two conditions
is often fairly fuzzy as well

FLAME ON

Reading through the posts about Kirlian whatever spelling
photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the
narrowminded I know it all I don't believe what I can't see or
measure attitude of many people out there

I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to
socalled paranormal stuff but as far as I'm concerned it is just
as likely as the existence of for instance a god which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies  without any scientific basis

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something ANYTHING simply because it doesn't fit your current frame
of reference History shows that many great people great scientists
were people who kept an open mind  and were ridiculed by sceptics

Especially the USA should be grateful after all Columbus did not
drop off the edge of the earth

FLAME OFF or end sermon 

We know that sermon  It is posted roughly every month or so by different
persons and that doesn't make it any better

How did you get the idea that skeptics are closedminded  Why don't you
consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the
proper methods  Besides one can come to a conclusion without closing
one's mind to other possibilities

I you don't agree with a person please ask him why he thinks like that
instead of insulting him  Perhaps he's right  Follow your own advice
be openminded

If you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims I'll complain that
it's always those neither a real believer nor a disbeliever types who 
narrowmindedly judge others without knowing their motives

Do I ever  After  years of having health problems that had been
cleared up wallery shots and not knowing why I went and was retested
I actually did better than when I had been tested  years ago
Then putting    together I realized that it all started back up
when the laser printer came into the office  I kept track of the usage and
on hi use days I was worse  I got better over the weekends

The laser printer is gone I'm  better Whether it is the toner
dust or chemicals I dont know I am highly allergic to dust but
it definitely was the laser printer

Forgive me but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a
physician's posting about the theraputic uses of vitamin B  I can't
seem to locate the article but I recall there was mention of some safe
limits

I looked at a Balanced  time release formulation from Walgreen's
and noted that the  mg of B was some thousands times the RDA  Is
this safe

Also what was the condition that B was theraputic for

	Millipedes I understand are vegetarian and therefore almost
certainly will not bite and are not poisonous Centipedes are
carnivorous and although I don't have any absolute knowledge on this I
would tend to think that you're in no danger from anything but a

 summarized
A person with a Schatzki's ring a membrane partially blocking the 
espphagus has worsening dysphagia difficulty swallowing and the 
doctor proposes dilation by balloow or bougie using an inflatable
balloon to rupture the ring or a rubber hose to push through it  

Question is balloon dilation safe common and indicated  It sounds
pretty invasive
 end summary

Yes this is a common and safe procedure  The majority of Schatzki's
rings described by xray however wnd up being due to inflammation
instead of the congenital Schatzki's ring  Occassionally a cancer
masquerades as a ring  You should have the endoscopy to see if it
is due to the heartburn and if so you will need treatment for the
heartburn ong term  The balloon dilation is an alternative to cutting
open your chest and cutting out a section of the esophagus so dilation
is not at all invasive considering the alternative  


 The second issue summarized  He has had extra heartbeats for the past
 to  years and once was symptomatic from them with some
lightheadedness
He is young ish thin and in good
 health recent bloodtests were all normal and do not smoke use drugs or
 caffeine etc I'm willing to accept the extra beats as normal but don't
 want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom The number
 of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day and with exercise or something
 as simple as climbing some stairs Also if I get up after sitting or lying
 down for a while I tend to get a couple of extra beats Could they possibly
 be related to the esophagous problems Both seemed to develop at about the
 same time

I' not an expert on heart problems but PVC's are common and have been
overtreated in the past  My personal experience and I have the same 
history an build you do related to the heart that is is that my PVC's
come and go with some months causing anxiety  Taking on more fluids
seems to help and they seem worse in the summer  Remember that a slow 
heart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent so perhaps it is an 
indication of a healthy cardiac system but ask an expert about that
last point especially

Good luck hope we don't die of arrhythmias  God what a happy thought

 Oh yes I did have a point  A few years ago an MD with a thriving
 practice in a very wealthy part of Silicon Valley once recommended that
 I take such treatments to clear up a skin condition  Not through his
 office I might add  Although I'm sure that's not conclusive it was
 sure an unusual prescription
 

The bacteria in your gut are important  But colonic flushes are not the 
way to improve gut function  Each person has almost a unique mix of 
bacteria in hisher gut  Diet affects this mix as does the use of 
antibiotics  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in 
your gut than is colonic flushes  Cross contamination has been a real 
problem in some of the outfits that do this treatment since the equipment 
is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient treatments
Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've 
picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his 
instrumentsmore clostly but much safer  Full sterile technique is 
also used just like that practiced in an ORmask gloves and gowns worn and 
disposed of between patients  Each visit costs me  dollars more than 
the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket  His much 
higher fees do not drive away patients

I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to 
this colonic flush procedure  For very little if any benefit you 
subject yourself to hepatitis cholera parasitic disease and even HIV
Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment
Could they be having GI distress  Could this distress be due to a 
pathogenic organism  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not 
cleaned properly between patients  Do I really want to take this risk
Food for thought

 My wife had hives during the first two months
 of her pregnancy  My son  months old breastfed
 now has the same symptoms  She has been to a skinspecialist
 but he has merely prescribed various medicines one
 each visit as though by trial and error 
 
 Antihistamines worked on both of them but looks like
 becoming less effective
 
 Are there other solutions  Thanks

Food products can get through breast milk and cause allergies in the
young  Since the son is allergic it would be best not to go to
bottle feedings but rather eliminate foods from mother's diet  Your
pediatrician should be able to give you a list of foods to avoid

Good luck Steve

First off I would consider the severity of the pain I had stones
several years ago and there's now way I could have made it without
heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the
hospital I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would
dissolve them If the stones are passible the best thing she could do
is drink LOTS of water and hope that they pass but every time they
move a little the pain will be excrutiating I was told by my doctor
at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth Yes
by a male doctor so I'm sure some of you women will disagree I'd
really like to know the truth in this so maybe some of you women who
have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in

I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't

I am a moderately severe asthmatic  ENT doc says large percentage see some
relief of their asthma after sinus surgery  Also he said it is not unheard of
that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved



 Did your ENT also tell you that this procedure may remove warts from the soles
 of your feet and improve your sex life



You probably were trying to be facetious but just for the record partial nasal
obstruction is correlated with a number of chronic disorders such as migraine
hyperthyroidism asthma peptic ulcer dysmenorrhea and lack of libido

So before you post your inane comments it would be nice if you'd run a MEDLINE
search on the topic say back to  There's been extensive literature on this

I may be in cardiology but I've had a very good working relationship with

What is the healthiest way to deal with earwax  Should one just leave
it in your ear and not mess with it or should you clean it out
every so often  Can cleaning it out damage your eardrums
Are there any tubes in your ear that might get blocked

Assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss congestion or popping
in the ears you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a
bulb syringe but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or
may even make things worse  My wife would disagree she does it
successfully every six months or so  In any case DO NOT ATTEMPT
ANYTHING WITH QTIPS

My experience has been that this is initially best handled by a
EarNoseThroat person  I say initially because an ENT can evaluate
whether or not you might have success on your own with a little
instruction

I am not a physician obviously because I eschew the term
otolaryngologist this posting is based only on personal experience

Greeting

I am starting work on a project where I am trying to make strain gages
bond to bone in vivo or a period of several months  I am currently
using hydroxyapaptite back gages and I have tried Mbonding the gages
to the bone  Apart from those two application methods there doesn't
seem to be much else in the literature  I have only an engineering 
background not medical or biological  I would be interest in any
ideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone

Thanks for oyur help in Advance

About two years ago I posted the following
 
I am planning to write a new book called Great Canadian Scientists
Please forward your nominations to me shellcssfuca
 
The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen They don't have
to be born in Canada or even live in Canada but they must have or have
had if they are dead Canadian citizenship while they arewere great
Canadian scientists
 
About  people have been nominated already and they are listed at the
end of this posting
 
I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness and there may be a
gray area here If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness I would be
pleased to hear them In any event please nominate people even if you are
not sure they are great I would like as big a list as possible
 
Please give me a name and email address phone number or mail address so
that I can contact the person If you don't know any of the above then
give me their last known whereabouts Also please give your reason for why
you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist
 
After I have the list I will choose about six of the most interesting ones
and do indepth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy
Kidder's Soul of a New Machine or some other dramatic technique
The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with 
one paragraph biographies
 
If you have any other ideas about this project I am interested to hear
them

The list is growing nicely It's amazing to see just how much was discovered
by Canadians Actually there are many more who were born in Canada but
became Americans after graduate school
 
Please note a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I
feel he was really a ScottishAmerican with a summer home in Canada Now
I know this is debatable but please don't nominate him again
 
If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list please drop
me a line

 
That was two years ago Since then I have received a grant from Science
Culture Canada a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the
book Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book
for kids aged    though this may change again It will have about
 twopage spreads with a large graphic in the middle and textgraphic
boxes all around on the following subjects Vital statistics and photo of
the scientist Personal statement from the scientist Narrative of a few
moments in the life of the scientist What I was doing when I was 
So you want to be a insert kind of scientist Experiment you can do There 
will be an appendix with    more scientists with one paragraph
biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads The whole thing
will then be published on CDROM with video and sound clips for added
richness I am looking for a CDROM publisher as well The text part may
also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in
Canada as well
 
I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close 
to being it Hope to find one soon 
 
I would like to again ask for more nominations especially in the
pure sciences of Physics Chemistry and Biology Also criticisms of 
the list are welcomed Also women and FrenchCanadian scientists are needed
 
I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian
Scientists and to discuss what is great what is Canadian and what is
scientist

FLAME ON

Especially the USA should be grateful after all Columbus did not
drop off the edge of the earth

WITHCOUNTERFLAMEENABLED

 Columbus was indeed a crank but not in the manner you think

 The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail  It was
 also well known that the circumference was about K miles and that you could
 not reach Asia bo going west with current technology  you would neither be
 able to carry enough supplies nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing
 weather  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world  Instead
 they expected him to die at sea

 Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only K miles
 making the trip practical

 Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates the Earth's circumference is
 indeed K miles

 Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates there was a stopping place right
 about where Asia would have been had the circumference been K miles


 My source is the recent PBS series on Columbus

Actually I am entering vet school next year but the question is 
relevant for med students too

Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically
Since this is a major portion of medical education  anatomy 
histology pathology pharmacology are for the most part mass 
memorization  I am a little concerned  As I am sure most 
med students are

Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization  I 
have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like
thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things  But I have
never applied them to large amounts of data

Has anyone had luck with any particular books memory systems or
cheap software   

Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques  Being an
older student who returned to school this year organization another
one of my weak points has been a major help to my success

Please no griping about how all you have to do is learn the material
conceptually  I have no problem with that it is one of my strong 
points  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is
rote memorization  

Thanks for your help

There have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological 
esp neurological conditions induced by playing video games
eg Nintendo Apparently there have been reported several cases of
photosensitive epilepsy due to the flashing of some
patterns and the strong attention of the young players
One poster to comprisks reported some action from
the British Government

A quick search in a database reported the following two published
references

 EJ Hart Nintendo epilepsy in New England J of Med  
 TK Daneshmend et al Dark Warrior epilepsy BMJ  

I would appreciate if someone could post or email 
any reference to preferably published further work on the subject
Any pointer to other information andor to possible technical tools

As a child i can remember picking up a centipede and getting a rather painful 
sting but it quickly subsided Much less painful compared to a bee sting 
Centipedes have a poison claw one of the front feet to stun their prey but
in my single experience it did not have a lot of bite to it

I do believe that depression can have a dietary component

Depression can also have various chemical environmental components
I noticed that I became depressed in various buildings and at home
when the air conditioning was on Subsequent testing revealed that
I was allergic to stemphyllium a mold commonly found in air conditioners
After I began taking antigens that problem disappeared

As I recall from my bout with kidney stones there isn't any
medication that can do anything about them except relieve the pain

Either they pass or they have to be broken up with sound or they have
to be extracted surgically

When I was in the Xray tech happened to mention that she'd had kidney
stones and children and the childbirth hurt less

Demerol worked although I nearly got arrested on my way home when I barfed
all over the police car parked just outside the ER

Some of the MD's in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good
maybe in some cases with good reason  In this post on depression I'm 
laying it all out  I'll continue to post here because I think that I have 
some knowledge that could be useful  Once you have read this post you 
should know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future

In article netnewsupennedu lchaplynmailsasupennedu Lida Chaplynsky writes
 
 A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on
 by menopause as well as a mental break down  She is being treated with
 Halydol with some success but the treatments being provided through her
 psychiatrist are not satisfactory  Someone suggested contacting a
 nutritionist to
 discuss alternative treatment  Since she is sensitive to medication I
 think this is a good suggestion but don't know where to begin  If anyone
 can suggest a Philly area nutritionist or else some literature to read
 I'd appreciate it
 
Lida
I can emphasize with your situation  Both my wife and I suffered from 
bouts of depression  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a 
rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and 
chemotherapy  Lida I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through 
her six months of chemotherapywith the approval of her oncologist  When 
severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped I tried to 
use supplements to bring her out of it  I had cured her PMS using 
supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet 
in depression to take care of her depression as well  It didn't work and 
she was put on Prozac by her oncologist  Two Winters agothree years after 
by wife's breast cancer I got hit with severe depressionpretty typical and 
one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another 
stressor  I tried to take care of it for several months with 
supplementation  Didn't work  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac 
I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using 
B niacin folate and B to cure depression  I'm not going to do that 
because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was

Lida I do believe that depression can have a dietary component  But the 
problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use 
an approach which will fix the problem  For chemotherapy I knew exactly 
what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be 
affected  Same thing for PMS  I was flying blind for both of these 
stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was 
pretty good  Depression is just too complicated  What you really need is 
a nutritional scan  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your 
bodies nutrient reserves  For every vitamin and mineralexcept vitamin C 
you have a reserve  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any 
nutrient to keep these reserves full it is only designed to keep them from 
being emptied which would cause clinical pathology  Stress will increase 
your need for many vitamins and minerals  This is when your reserves become 
very important

Lida without your permission I'm going to use your post as a conduit to 
try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci Med where I'm coming 
from  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic 
Medical schools for ten years now  I've written my own textbook because 
none was available  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry  I 
preach nutrient reservesyes my lectures in this course are referred to by 
my students as sermons  Here is what I cover

Indroduction and Carbohydrates 			Lipids

Proteins I					Proteins II

Energy Balance					Evaluation of Nutritional
						Status I A Clinical

Other Nutrient Factors				Enteral Nutrition

Parenteral Nutrition

Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature 
to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook  I last did this 
in the Summer of   I read everything that I can find and then sit down 
and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books 
that have   and  pages  Opposite each page of written textwhich 
I write myself I've pulled figures tables and graphs from various 
copyrighted sources  Since this material is only being used for 
educational purposes I can get around the copyright laws so far  I can not 
send this material out to newsgroup readersas I've been asked to do

I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition 
assessment lab  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need 
to make my education program complete  This lab will let me measure the 
nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to 
be required in humans  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to 
design supplement programs for their cancer patients  Cancer Treatment 
Centers of America which is a private forprofit organization with 
hospitals in Illinois and OklahomaTulsa also operates a 
nutritional assessment clinical lab  I also believe that the Pritikin 
Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup

For physicians reading this post I would suggest that you get the new 
Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been publishedFeb by Mosby  I 
have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeuticsa Little Brown 
series book as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more 
to residency training  Two MD's have written this new Clinical Nutrition
textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it 
does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a 
patient's nutritional status  Let me quote a few sentences from the 
Preface of this new text

Socalled nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists 
hematologists or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge 
of nutrition as it related to their field of practice  

Unfortunately about two thirds of the medical schools in the United 
States require no formal instruction in nutrition

But times and medical practice have changed  More than half of the 
leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related

 this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives  it 
should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of 
nutrition to your medical practice and  it should heighten your 
awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important 
for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially 
every organ system

Roland L Weinsier MD DrPH 

Lida my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find 
a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals
yes even magnesium may play a role in depression play in depression and 
who could get a nutritional profile run  Menopause is often a time when 
women suffer depression  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are 
occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS  A 
nutritionist may also be able to help  Not too long ago a poster mentioned 
that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red 
cell glutathionine peroxidase testthe specific test for the selenium 
reserve  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to 
try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified  There are 
also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral 
analysis but these labs are not regulated  Checks of these labs using 
certified standards and also those doing water lead analysis showed some 
pretty shoddy testing was going on  If you or anyone else finds someone 
who will run these speciality nutrition tests make sure that they are 
using a lab that has been certified under CLIAthe Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Act  

A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown 
to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging 
and software analysisNutritionist IV and other software programs  But 
there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not 
show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status
Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the 
US and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional 
profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses 
diet changes and supplementation antidepressants will probably continue 
to be the best approach to depression

Hi Stephen
Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections both by preventing
a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties  Too much can block the
external auditory canal the hole in the outside of the ear and cause some 
hearing problems  It is very simple and safe to remove excess wax on your
own or at your physician's office  You can take a syringe no needles and
fill it with  warm water cold can cause fainting and  OTC hydrogen
peroxide  Then point the ear towards the ceiling  about  degrees up
and insert the tip of the syringe helps to have someone else do this and  
firmly expell the solution  Depending on the size of the syringe and the
tenacity of the wax this could take several rinses  If you place a bowl 
under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier   You can buy
a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy or just use whatever
you may have  If wax is old it will be harder and darker  You can try
adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
the wax  Do this for a couple days then try syringing again  It is also
safe to point your ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse
it out
Good Luck

  Marty I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article 
  on kidney stones as gospel First of all I would want to know who
  sponsored that study
  I have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from
  local newspapers magazines to TVguide with disclaimers on the
  bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us
  compliments of the Dairy Industries
  There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive
  financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous 
  benefits of increasing one's calcium intake
 
  Secondly were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved 
  in that project analysed for their chemical composition  The study
  didn't say that it only claimed that most kidney stones are large
  ly calcium
  Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact
  opposite findings A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they
  are oftentimes just plain wrong It wouldn't be the first time
  
  Sodiummagnesiumcalciumphosphorus ratios are in my opinion still 
  the most reliable indicators for the cause treatment and prevention 
  of kidney stones
  I for one will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
  one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
  stones of either type and they definitely won't include an INCREASE
  in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium
  type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit
  from a PHOSPHORUSraising approach instead
 
      Ron Roth

Ron you are absolutely right  Not all kidney stones have calcium and not 
all calcium stones are calciumoxalate  But the vast majority are calcium
oxalate  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle  I cited that NEJM article 
as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that 
conventional wisdom is used in medicine always has been and probably 
always will be  If one uses conventional wisdom there is a chance that 
you will be wrong  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of 
damage what's the big dealwhy call a physician who gives antifungals to 
sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack

On the kidney stone problem  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical 
chemistry lab  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of 
calcium  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to 
measure mineral balance in the body  I know that you don't think that the 
serum levels for minerals are very usefulI agree  If I can get a good 
nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue 
reserve for minerals I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see 
how your technique compares with mine

The millipede's around here Austin have no sting  Some of the

asking How venomous are snakes  One either wants to ask which
snake or point to some reference on the many different species

millipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment while

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to

were people who kept an open mind  and were ridiculed by sceptics

a problem with one of these diseases don't use what I'm going to tell you 
or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor  You have to go
Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help 
you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment 
programbut the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here  When 
my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say don't worry my vitamin 
E will take care of it  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician 
plan and simple  If it's begninwhich most are fine then maybe a diet 
change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring
But let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementation 
and another lump returns get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as 
your little feet can carry youbetter yet have a mammography done on a 
regular basis my wife kept putting her's off both myself and her 
gynocologist told her she needed to have one done  Her gynocologist even 
scheduled one but she didn't show uptoo busy running the Operating Room for 
the biggest Hospital in Tulsa

One more thing I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist  This group uses 
high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease  There is 
absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have 
drug actions in the body  But you talk about flying blind man this is 
really blind treatment  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and 
minerals are being used  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't 
be right on the money it may well be  But my approach to nutrition is a 
lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan the two MD's who wrote the new 
Clinical Nutrition textbook  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab 
tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet 
changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you 
handle stress  That's where I'm coming from folks  Blast away if you want
I'm not going to change  Put me in your killfile if you want I really 
don't care  I'm averaging  email messages a day from people who think 
that I've got something important to say  But I'm also getting hit by a 
few with an axe to grind  That's life

Chromium is one of the trace elements  It has a very limitedbut very 
important role in the body  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor
GTF  GTF is made up of chromium nicinamideniacin glycine cysteine 
and glutamic  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to 
form GTF  Some foods already have GTFLiver brewers or nutritional yeast
and black pepper  When chromium is in GTF a pretty good absorption is 
seenabout   But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral 
chelatechromium picolinate it's absorption is much lower to  lowest 
for all the minerals  I've been posting in Misc Fitness and chromium has 
come up there several times as a fat burner  Chromium is among the least 
toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really 
do any harm  I wouldn't do it though  The adequate and safe range for 
chromium is  to ug per day  The average American is getting about 
ug per day from hisher diet  Chromium levels decrease with age and many 
believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency  I 
can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in 
Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one there 
also seems to be a negative one as well  I'm convinced that the problem is 
bioavailability  When yeastGTF is used good results are obtained but when 
chromium itself is used the results are usually negative  In addition to 
Type II diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and 
glucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is 
concerned

Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease 
this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising  Glucoma is a little 
more interesting  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin 
responsive glucosedriven metabolic function  If this eye focusing activity 
is impairedby a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocular 
pressure is believed to be elevated  In a fairly large study of  pts with 
glaucoma the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium J Am Coll 
Nutr   But this one preliminary study should not prompt 
people to go out and start popping chromium supplements  For one thing 
just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless 
they have been taking chromium suppleemntsyeast  Since glucoma is often 
found in older people it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the 
RBC's  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would 
prompt some attention  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to 
check out this possible chromium link to glucoma

You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC 
chromium test or hair analysis  Most clinical labs are not going to run a 
RBC chromium  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail 
analysis for you but I wouldn't use them  There is just too much funny 
business going on in these unregulated labs right now

Here's Weinsier and Morgan advise on chromium  They do not consider 
chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is 
availablethey don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either and they 
also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not 
routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs  This has to change 
and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum it will  What then do they suggest
Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical 
response to chromiumrun a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium 
supplementation  Once you make the diagnosis put the patient on ug of 
CrCl orally each day or grams of yeast per day

What's my advise  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight
they just do not work that way  If you want to take them and then 
exercise that would be great  Do include yeast as part of your dietmost 
Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet  If you do have 
a poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status  
When he or she says what in the world are you talking about just say 
please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook 
and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose 
tolerance  If you can't do that I'll find a doctor who can thank you 
very much

First because I distributed the message to so many newsgroups I did
       not check the crosspostings of the article I followed up on

Second for not making my argument clear enough I reacted to the tone
        of many of the antiKirlian posts not to their content Right
        or wrong I found the arguments set in arrogant and sneering words
        that includes jokes which I still think is unwarranted

And obviously I should not have done the same

In a previous article banschbachvmsocomokstateedu  says
least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the US  It's really 
too bad that most US medical schools don't cover nutrition because if 
they did candida would not be viewed as a nondisease by so many in the 
medical profession

Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as
well as covering it in other sections as they apply ie B
deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy B deficiency in
hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia yet I sill
hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine  candida can cause
mucocutaneous candidiasis and in already very sick patients
with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients
systemic candida infection  I think The Yeast Connection is
a bunch of hooey  What does this have to do with how well
nutrition is taught anyway

Here is a brief primer on yeast  Yeast infections as they are commonly 
called are not truely caused by yeasts  The most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a 
yeastlike fungus  

Well maybe I'm getting picky but I always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in the other being the
mold form  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds 
depending on environment  Candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism  it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment  Should we maybe
call it a mold infection  a fungus infection  Maybe we
should say it is caused by a moldlike fungus

 want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom The number
 of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day and with exercise or something
 as simple as climbing some stairs Also if I get up after sitting or lying
 down for a while I tend to get a couple of extra beats Could they possibly
 be related to the esophagous problems Both seemed to develop at about the
 same time

I' not an expert on heart problems but PVC's are common and have been
overtreated in the past  My personal experience and I have the same 
history an build you do related to the heart that is is that my PVC's
come and go with some months causing anxiety  Taking on more fluids
seems to help and they seem worse in the summer  Remember that a slow 
heart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent so perhaps it is an 
indication of a healthy cardiac system but ask an expert about that
last point especially

I too have had premature ventricular heartbeat starting in   These 
are not by the way extra heartbeats  This is how they feel and 
this is how I described them initially to the doctor but they're 
actually premature heartbeats  I would sometimes experience a lapse 
after one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time 
making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again 

I had them persistently for eighteen years  Then I went on a lowfat 
diet and they just stopped  I haven't had a single episode of PVH 
for almost two years  I know  correlation does not imply causation 
This is just FWIW

 Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor
 
 Last Saturday evening my  year old son cut his finger badly with a knife
 I took him to a local Urgent and General Care clinic at  pm  The 
 clinic was open till  pm  The receptionist went to the back and told the 
  other good stuff about the Drs idiocy

Ok much as I hate to do it here I am posting an EVEN BETTER Dr Idiot
story


I was in my th hour of labor had been pushing for  hours and was
exhausted  My OB and I decided to go for a csec  The OB called in
the anesthisiologist sp and asked him to help prep me for surgery

AFTER watching me go through a couple contractions the anes or anus as
I like to refer to him said Well I am off duty now still staring
between my legs at that  The OB asked to go call whomever it was who
was on duty and ask himher how long it would takeand if it was going
to take more than a few minutes to please stay even though he was off duty

The anes went out supposedly to call the oncall anes   In a couple of
minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes had left
without even trying to get ahold of the oncall  It was the only time 
during my labor that I swore  The oncall anes took  minutes to get
there

Come to find out the anes had only just gone off duty about  minutes
before and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the
next oncall got there  Good thing for all of us especially him that
it was not a critical emergency  But boy would I love to knock that
fellow's ouchie places just to let him be in pain a
few little minutes

can't imagine what it's like to have a penis much less a foreskin I
guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance

The penile cancer thing has been completely debunkedshe must be
going to school on a South Pacific island Tell her to check the Journal
or Urology for circumcision articles I remember at least  on an old
Jewish man cut at birth who developed penile cancerI mean if the
cancer risk was that great the Europe who have been circumcising like
crazy too Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue a
little proper hygiene goes a long way  Americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it that's just way too much like
mastubation So you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary

First off use some decent terms if ya don't mind  This is scimed not
altsex

Secondly how absolutely bogus to assume that American's are just too hung
up on the penisblahblah  I think most American's don't care about
anything so comlicated as that  They just think it looks nicer  Ask 
a few of them and see what response you get  Others still opt for
circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs  Some think it is
easier to clean  Still others do it because Daddy was

Dont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality 

My son is not circumcised and I can vouch for the argument that it is
more difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids'  Not so much that
the foreskin is difficult to pull back it isn't but because my son
doesn't want to wait long enough for a thorough check for smega or misplaced
feces  So many times it just gets a once over dab  It worries me
that he might get an infection due to his lack of cooperation  I am
sure however that he will be able to handle cleaning under the foreskin
himself once he is old enough  Until there is always the decision at
each diaper changeis this the time to clean or can we wait till next
time

will increase muscle mass and decrease fat  Of course chromium is also used t

 What is the healthiest way to deal with earwax  Should one just leave
 it in your ear and not mess with it or should you clean it out
 every so often  Can cleaning it out damage your eardrums
 Are there any tubes in your ear that might get blocked
 
 Assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss congestion or popping
 in the ears you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a
 bulb syringe but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or
 may even make things worse  My wife would disagree she does it
 successfully every six months or so  In any case DO NOT ATTEMPT
 ANYTHING WITH QTIPS

I'll agree with your wife  While I was a student I had doctors remove
rather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple
times usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason and
said something like Gee you've got a lot of wax in there  In my case
removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing and
I've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with
warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months  You can buy little
bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store 
I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything

One question I do have  a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated
a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining
trapped water  said he told swimmers to do this after swimming too  It
works but it stings like the devil so I've always been content to let any
water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get
out by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick  Any

In article rppdusenetINSCWRUEdu esdpoCWRUEdu Elisabeth S Davidson writes
 
 In a previous article banschbachvmsocomokstateedu  says
least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the US  It's really 
too bad that most US medical schools don't cover nutrition because if 
they did candida would not be viewed as a nondisease by so many in the 
medical profession
 
 Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as
 well as covering it in other sections as they apply ie B
 deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy B deficiency in
 hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia yet I sill
 hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine  candida can cause
 mucocutaneous candidiasis and in already very sick patients
 with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients
 systemic candida infection  I think The Yeast Connection is
 a bunch of hooey  What does this have to do with how well
 nutrition is taught anyway

Elisabeth let's set the record straight for the nth time I have not read 
The Yeast Connection  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing 
by this hated book  It's okay I guess to hate the book by why hate me
Elisabeth I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology th Edition
A book that you should be familiar with and not hate Candida species 
colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly 
thereafter  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present  
Indeed candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic 
mycosis  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic 
infectioncandidiasis so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or 
sick neutrophils to see a systemic infection  Poor diet and persistent 
parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis
Your assessment of candidiasis in the US is correct and I do not dispute 
it

What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms without systemic 
infection  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation
GI tract mouth vagina and sinus cavity  Knocking down the bacterial 
competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida 
blooms  Let me quote from Zinsser's again However some factors such as 
the use of a broadspectrum antibacterial antibiotic may predispose to 
both mucosal and systemic infections  I was addressing mucosal infections
I like the term blooms better  The nutrition course that I teach covers 
this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the cure  I guess that 
your nutrition course does not too bad  


Here is a brief primer on yeast  Yeast infections as they are commonly 
called are not truely caused by yeasts  The most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a 
yeastlike fungus  
 
 Well maybe I'm getting picky but I always thought that a yeast
 was one form that a fungus could exist in the other being the
 mold form  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds 
 depending on environment  Candida exibits what is known as
 reverse dimorphism  it exists as a mold in the tissues
 but exists as a yeast in the environment  Should we maybe
 call it a mold infection  a fungus infection  Maybe we
 should say it is caused by a moldlike fungus

 You're the chairman of Biochem and Micro and you didn't know 
 that a yeast is a form of a fungus  shudder
 Or maybe you did know and were oversimplifying

My my Elisabeth do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you  If you 
noticed my faculty rank I'm a biochemist not a microbiologist
Candida is classifed as a fungusaccording to Zinsser's  But as you point 
out it displays dimorphism  It is capable of producing yeast cells 
pseudohyphae and true hyphae  Elisabeth you are probably a microbiologist 
and that makes a lot of sense to you  To a biochemist it's a lot of 
Greek  So I called it a yeastlike fungus go ahead and crucify me

You know Elisabeth I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small 
little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in 
Sci Med  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too
I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what 
I've said that it will make sense  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into 
The Yeast Connection book because I don't know what's in that book plain 
and simple And to be honest with you I'm beginning to wish that it was never 
written

ANP is secreted by the atria in response to increases in fluid volume
and acts to facilitate sodium and water excretion from the kidneys
Can someone tell me the molecular mechanism by which this is done

 I recently heard of some testing of a new migraine drug called sumatripton
 I have no idea of the actual spelling that supposedly utilizes a chemical
 that trips neurotransmitters  My mother has regular migraines and nothing
 seems to help  does anyone know anything about this new drug  Is it in
 a testing phaze or anywhere near approval  Does it seem to be working
 
My girlfriend just started taking this drug for her migranes  It really
helped her get through the rebound withdrawl when she got off analgesics 
She doesn't have a mail account but asked me to forward this

Glaxo is the distributor Imitrex is the drug's brand name  It works 
She can call her pharmacy for more info The miracle drug has been used
for years in Europe and for some time in Canada  Trials in the US were
completed and the drug hit the US market at the end of March  Some
pharmacies don't stock it yet  Presently it needs to be injected
subcutaneously although testing is starting with a nasal spray form  It
mimics serotonin its molecular structure that fits onto pain receptors
looks identical to serotonin on a model I saw

Opinions are mine or others but definately not MDA's

          Kervran  Edition is BEST and in Chapter  of the 
          book THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS by Peter Tompkins and 
          Christopher Bird  

                Obtain a good sample of plant seeds all of the same 
                   kind  Some kinds might work better that others

                Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight 
                   and number

                Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper 
                   for three or four weeks

                Separately incinerate both groups

                Weigh the residue from each group  The residue of 
                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least 
                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group

                Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for 
                   mineral content  Some of the mineral atoms of the 
                   sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier

          carbon such as horsetail extract or radishes can SPEED 
          HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si  C  Ca much 
          faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly  
          
               Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro
          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon carbon nitrogen 
          oxygen hydrogen etc 
          
               The two reactions Si  C  Ca by microorganisms 
          cause STONE SICKNESS in statues building bricks etc  
          
               The reaction N  CO catalysed by very hot iron

 Outside of study results how about informed speculation

I've heard of NO studies but speculation

Why on earth would there be any effect on women's health  That's about

I'm not asking anyone here to buy into The Yeast Connection book
because I don't know what's in that book plain and simple And to be honest
with you I'm beginning to wish that it was never written

I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way
it was  My doctor  who claims to have introduced Dr Crook to the
possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in
 I have no reason to doubt him on this  does not like the book
because  it makes too many unfounded claims and  is horribly written
from a scientific viewpoint  On the other hand my doctor has always kept
an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the yeast
connection

But I believe there is some truth to the book  Hopefully the right
clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction  In
the meantime I'd still encourage people who have incurable chronic sinus
problems especially if they overused antibiotics to find a doctor to
administer a systemictype antifungal such as itraconazole along with
liver panels before during and after treatment just to play it safe  It
is an empirical approach for sure but when all else fails and your ENT
says sorry you'll just have to live with it it is time to step out and
try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence
Dr Ivker supported by plausible theories outlined by Marty  At
this stage you have little to lose particularly if you use itraconazole and
have the proper monitoring  the health risk has been shown through extensive
clinical studies both in Europe and the US to be very minimal with
relatively healthy ie nonAIDS patients  I'm glad I did this since I
saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox itraconazole  Of
course your mileage may vary a lot  everyone is different so it may not
work for you  Talk to your doctor

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy
of cancer  I was just wondeing since you mentioned thhat she has an
oncologist

A bone scan is a nuclear scan  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a
dose of a radioactive tracer and an imaging device is used to track the
distribution of the tracer wwithin the body  The tracer is usually given
intravenously  IV This means that the physician or his assistant will
insert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein 

After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the
body the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high 
concentrations of the tracer  The radiologist or doctor is looking for
areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it

As far as pain the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required
to start the IV line

What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may
have resulted from cancer  This is also why I was wondering if your mother
has had cancer since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the
skeletal system

I hope I have answered some of your questions  Feel free to email me if
you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related
to your mother's care  I'm a newly graduated nurse and I enjoy sharing
information with other people to help them understand things that they did
not know about before

My thoughts are with you both

	For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful
when I try to get up in the morning  My sleep latency at night is also
pretty long  ranging from  min to an hour  I get about  hours of
bedtime maybe  of actual sleep a night and more on the weekends  I
will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can  because
I feel so tired when I wake up  even more tired than I was when I
went to bed  which is usually too tired to work

	Anyway  I recently had a really bad flu  so I called a friend to
get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant
but he got Vicks formula M which has everything but an expectorant  So
I used that anyway  and the three nights I used it  I fell asleep rapidly
and felt that I got really good quality sleep  that is  I actually
felt refreshed the next morning

	So  I am now trying to look into  both in the literature and
experimentally  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids  since I am
presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect  The
antihistamine in Vicks formula  is Chloriphenamine maleate  so I bought
some generic tablets of that  and tried one last night and didn't
notice any improvement  I might try one with a little alcohol about
 beer to see if it is a synergism effect  Also  library research
seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest
sedative effect of what is availible OTC  So I might also buy a generic
form of that and try that  the PDR seems to suggest that  mg is a good
dosage level to try

	For other medical information  I have allergies but rarely have
an allergic reaction living in New Mexico  I also have chronically dry
eyes  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants  I did
guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia  so I made some
changes in my diet consistent with that  and it didn't help  so I
went back to a normal diet Pretty diverse  also taking vitamin supplements

	Anyway  I am looking for advice for the use of
antihistamines as sleep aids  and if there are any dangers of such use
Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by
millions  I don't want to try BZs  because BZ addiction seems to be
a serious threat  and from what I hear  BZ sleep quality is not good
whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me  I have

Have I mailed this to the correct newsgroups Are there other newsgroups
which cover the following topic


Has anyone with myopia shortsightedness ever done the Bates eyeexercises

If so could you please email me the following information

	 age and state of sight before exercises were commenced

	 type frequency and length of time spent on exercises performed

	 improvements noticed immediately after performing exercises

	 length of period before any improved sight deteriorates

Thanks in advance for any replies I'll summarise and post results if there's
enough interest

When I was a school boy my biology teacher told us of an incident
in which a couple were very passionate without actually having
sexual intercourse  Somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm
cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation
Was my biology teacher misinforming us or do such incidents actually
occur

Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg  There is only one way for
pregnancy to occur intercourse  These days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques but we're speaking of
natural acts here  It is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is
deposited just outside of the vagina ie coitus interruptus but that's
about at far as you can get  Through clothes  no way  Better go talk
to your biology teacher

I have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings  Some say
the lead mercury leeches into your system and this is bad  And I have
recently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breeding
ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics   

My dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where I have
two cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both
He says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large
So I would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam
and composite  And should I really even be worried about amalgam  I
heard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more 
is this true

Any information you can give me will be greatly appreciated


Thanks

I'm interested in this from the other angle what antihistamine can I
take at bedtime for relief of allergies with the assurance that its
sedative effect will have completely worn off by the next morning but
preferably with the antiallergy effect lasting longer

I'm thinking mainly of OTC products Which has the least duration of
sedative action Benadryl ChlorTrimeton or what
Note that I'm asking about duration not intensity

I recently heard of some testing of a new migraine drug called
sumatripton I have no idea of the actual spelling that supposedly
utilizes a chemical that trips neurotransmitters  My mother has
regular migraines and nothing seems to help  does anyone know anything
about this new drug  Is it in a testing phaze or anywhere near
approval  Does it seem to be working
 
I just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting
where the consensus was that sumatriptan Imitrex has no advantages
over DHE nasal spray which is much less expensive has fewer side
effects is as effective and works more quickly  minutes vs 
Besides who wants to give themselves a shot sumatriptan when a nasal
spray works  DHE nasal spray is not widely available yet  it has to
be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country  but most
neurologists now know about it and know how to order it

 actually happens beneath the skin I would like to know if there is any

As a matter of fact I just saw a dermatologist the other day and while I 
was there I asked him about dry skin I'd been spending a small fortune
on various creams lotions and other dry skin treatments
He said all I needed was a large jar of vaseline Soak in a lukewarm tub
of water for  minutes ONLY  minutes then massage in the vaseline
to trap the moisture in That will help I haven't tried it yet but you
can bet I will The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the
vaseline properly If it's not done right you remain greasy and stick
to your clothes
Try it It's got to be cheaper then spending  for  oz of 'natural'
lotion

every so often  Can cleaning it out damage your eardrums
Are there any tubes in your ear that might get blocked

The best thing to do is leave it it will work its own way out to the surface
Anything you stick up there to try and clean it is just going to push the wax
up against your eardrum and pack it on there solid thus impairing your

One question I do have  a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated
a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining
trapped water  said he told swimmers to do this after swimming too  It
works but it stings like the devil so I've always been content to let any
water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get
out by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick  Any
comments

When I have trouble it's usually because of water trapped by some
remaining wax  I don't see why you can't just let it evaporate it
should do this eventually

Reading through the posts about Kirlian whatever spelling

narrowminded I know it all I don't believe what I can't see or
measure attitude of many people out there

I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to
socalled paranormal stuff but as far as I'm concerned it is just
as likely as the existence of for instance a god which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies  without any scientific basis

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something ANYTHING simply because it doesn't fit your current frame
of reference History shows that many great people great scientists
were people who kept an open mind  and were ridiculed by sceptics

Especially the USA should be grateful after all Columbus did not
drop off the edge of the earth

It is one thing to be openminded about phenomona that have not
be demonstrated to be false and quite another to believe in
something like Krilian photography where all the claimed effects
have be demonstrated to be artifacts  There is no longer any reason
to adopt a wait and see attitude about Krilian photography it
has been experimentally shown to be nothing but simple coronal
discharge  The auras shown by missing leaf parts came from 
moisture left by the original whole leaf for example  

That's what science is son

Hi

My wife has aquired some thyroidal sp deficiency over the past year
that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep coldness and proneness
to gaining weight She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary 
tests and her values were regarded as low The doctor and my wife are
not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the 
gland giving lifelong dependency to the drug hormone The last couple of 
monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath sp and been given
some drops to reactivate either her thyroidal gland andor the 
'messagecenter' in the brain sorry about the approximate language
but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are but the 
brainarea is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian 

My questions are has anyone hadheard of success in using this approach
Her values have been slowly but steadily sinking any comment on the
probability of improvement Although the doctor has told her to 'eat
normally' my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
that is part of keeping an edge over the illnesscondition may this
affect the treatment development

I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested and I
will greatly value any informationopinionexperience on this topic

I don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established
medical profession or a praise for alternatives I am just relaying
events as they have happened

Sincerely

A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital
because of suspected meningitis  Serious business  They wanted to do
a lumbar puncture for which a CT scan is a prerequisite

I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned
from the CT   She was in tears  Evidently the technicians in the CT
lab had been very unpleasant to her

To begin with they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the
machine itself and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the
machine without any explanation  Imagine this  You worried you may
have a deadly disease and next thing you know you're being put into
this big scary machine without a word of explanation about what is
going to happen to you  I believe this is inexcusable   She waved her
hand as if to say what are you doing to me and they responded with
annoyance and anger  Next they inserted or tried to insert an IV
catheter  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained
of the pain  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare
without any words of explanation

Is there anything I can do about these pigs 

I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day
out  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative
But this is simply no excuse  Their purpose for existing is to help
sick people and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior
Fortunately my friend is fine  But I imagine a large proportion of the
people who get CT scans are not fine at all  They have cancer and that
sort of thing  They don't need this kind of shit

Also since I named the hospital involved I should also point out that
neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion
of any of the other personnel at NCMH

Thanks for listening

Robert

I'm so glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion  I've 
been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci Med
I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your postsjust 
like I haven't read The Yeast Connection

Let me just start by stating that the authors of the Cold Fusion papers of 
recent years are now in scientific exileI believe that one has actually 
left the country  Scientific fraud is rare  I'm still not sure that if a 
review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually 
proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation

Your sources do not seem to be research articles  They are more like lay 
texts designed to pique human interest in a subject areajust like the food 
combining and life extension texts  Robert I try to keep an open mind
But some things I just can't buyone is taking SOD orally to prevent 
oxidative damage in the body

Your experiment if conducted by readers of this news group would prove 
that you are rightmore ash after seed sprouting than before  Unless you 
use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperatureabove  degrees 
I believe you will get organic residue in the ash  Even the residue in 
commercial incinerators contains organic residue  I remember doing this 
kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I 
couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really 
guessing at  degrees F it may actually be much higher  The point is 
that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to 
produce only a mineral ash  They also could not measure the minerals so 
they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct 

Chemical reactions abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water and 
in our soil  Are these fusion reactions  Yes many of them do involve 
fusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics  Do we 
really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with 
silicon  Not in my book Robert

Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet  I've seen speculation 
that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon 
based lifeform  I like reading science fiction as many people do  But I 
know enough about biochemistryand nutrition to be ablein most cases to 
separate the fiction from the fact

Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in 
humans  We have several grams of the stuff in our body  What's it doing 
there  Only the Lord knows right now  But I will tell you what I do know 
about silicon and why as you state it helps bone healingand it is not 
because silicon is transformed into calcium

Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective 
tissuecollagen and elastin  There have been studies published which show 
that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective 
factor against atherosclerosisthe higher the silicon content in elastin 
the more resistant the elastin is to a an agerelated loss of elasticity 
which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as 
part of the ageing process in humans

For bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into which 
calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts  A high level of silicon 
in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation  This first step in the 
bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going
Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming 
cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in 
the gapor gaps between the ends of the broken bone  A vitamin C deficiency
by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of 
defective collagen does slow down both bone and wound healing  Zinc is also 
another big player in bone and wound healing  And so is siliconin an  
undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not 
transformation of silicon to calcium  For you to take this bone healing 
observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into 
calcium is an interesting little trick

But Robert I have the same problem myself when I read the lay pressand 
yes even some scientific papers  Is the explanation reasonable  Without 
a very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news group 
are flying blindyou have to take it on faith because you don't know any 
better

If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base 
I'm inclined to consider itthis usually means trying to find other sources 
that come to the same conclusion  If the idealike a candida bloom seems 
to make sense to me I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm 
going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up  If this makes us 
kindred souls Robert then I guess I'll have to live with that label

For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's 
interesting post I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric 
neurosurgeon last night on US TV  I can't remember the network or his 
namelike many nights I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in 
our Den where I have my computer setup  This neurosurgeon takes kids with 
brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he usesunconventional
treatmentshis own words  He says that he has a  success rate  The one 
case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiationconventional 
treatment  He was going to go in and cut  You guys complain about the 
cost of the antifungals  What do you think the cost difference between 
radiation treatment and surgery is guys 

I'm going to ask you guys one more time why blast a physician who takes the 
chronic sinus suffererlike Jon and the chronic GI suffererlike Elaine
and tries to help them using unconventional treatments  Treatments which 
do not result in deathlike those that the neurosurgeon uses  Is it 
because candida blooms are not lifethreatening while brain tumors are
How about quality of life guys  May the candida demon never cross your 
sinus cavity or gutif it does you may feel differently about the issue

Antihistamines have been the active ingredient of OTC sleep aids for
decades  Go to any drugstore and look at the packages of such sleep
aids as Sominex Nytol etc  The active ingredient is
diphenhydramine the same antihistamine that's in Benadryl

 constipation chronic cough colon cancer and you're not too young for

Well that post was not that accurate  People with early life hernias
are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias
The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining  
However the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is 
high enough that it ought to be repaired  The risk of cancer is probably
no higher than the general population but since you are near  it would
be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening such as a flexible
sigmoidoscopy  Sorry for the misleading info

Hi

My wife has aquired some thyroidal sp deficiency over the past year
that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep coldness and proneness
to gaining weight She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary 
tests and her values were regarded as low The doctor and my wife are
not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the
gland giving lifelong dependency to the drug hormone


My questions are has anyone hadheard of success in using this approach
Her values have been slowly but steadily sinking any comment on the
probability of improvement Although the doctor has told her to 'eat
normally' my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
that is part of keeping an edge over the illnesscondition may this
affect the treatment development


There are several different types of Thyroid diseases which would cause
a hypothyroid condition reduction in the output of the thyroid mainly
thyroxin Except for ones caused by infections the treatment is
generally thyroxin pills Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections
usually disappear when the infection doesthis doesn't sound like the
case with your wife
Thyroxin orally does shut down the thyroid through a feedback loop
involving the pituitary I believe The pituitary thinks that the
correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to
tell the thyroid to produce more This process is reversable I have
Hashimoto's thyroiditis an autoimmune condition and was on thyroxin
for approx  mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills
for  wks When I was retested for thyroxin levels they were normal
I still get tested every mo because the condition might reappear
The pills are safe and have very few sideaffects  those mostly at
beginning of treatment Having a baby might be a problem and would at
least require closer monitoring of hormone levels
Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness coldness
and weight gain There is also water retention possibly around heart
changes in vision and coarser hair and skin among other things

I am not a doctor so I'm sure I mistated something but the important
thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they
aren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body Get a
second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have himher explain
things in detail to you and your wife

I've sent Gordon R my posts on protein vitamin C and vitamin A prior to 
posting on internet as a professional courtesy  Somehow I've managed to 
delete my vitamin A post from my text file  Gordon R had promised to send 
it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it
Since digging through all my references is very time consumingtook me all 
day for that PMS post I'm not going to cite any referencesGordon R has 
them  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and 
Morgan's new Nutrition textbookwhich was not in my original material to 
point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical 
community

Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long 
time  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've 
already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection
Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in 
the US as far as infection is concernedvitamin A

When vitamin A was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as 
the antiinfection vitamin  Many peopleLinus Pauling being one have 
decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C
which I've already covered  Big mistakein my opinion  Vitamin A is 
also getting a reputation as an anticancer vitaminwith good reason
The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if 
vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well  It's role in 
both cancer and infection is almost identicalbut not quite

Vitamin A comes in two completely different formsretinol and 
betacarotene  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic betacarotene 
is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic  Both retinol and beta
carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present
  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other 
tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding proteinRBP  A normal human 
adult liver should have IU to IU of retinol stored  We 
are born with IU in our liver  US autopsy has shown that about 
 of Americans die with the sameor less amount of vitamin A as they 
were born with  If you don't believe that nutritional reserveslike that 
of retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin A reserve is 
not going to affect you  But if you believelike I do that the nutrient 
reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin A in the US

The US RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is  RE or IU of 
vitamin A  For adult feamles its  RE or IU of vitamin A  Diet 
surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A
either retinol or Betacarotene from their diet  But the NRCNational 
Research Council was going to release a new RDA table in  that had the 
RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raisedC to mg per day and A to 
IU per day for adult males  That report and it's recommendations was 
killed  Why Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main 
reason  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient 
reserves full  Many scientist in the US feel that the time has come to 
move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move 
towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have 
some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely 
important during periods of stress  The nutritonal concervatives won that 
battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 
 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the 
dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 
'sget enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill 
the reserves

We know from autopsy that only about  of Americans have a liver with a 
normal vitamin A reserveIU to IU  I preach nutrient 
reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients
But for vitamin A only a liver biopsyor autopsy data will tell you how 
much somebody has stored  We can tell very easily if someone has 
overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol 
levellevels above ugdl are highly suggestive that you have filled your 
liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol  The normal 
range of serum retinol will be ugdl  Hypervitaminosis A is 
diagnosed with a serum retinol level of ugdl or higherInterpretation 
of Diagnostic Test Wallach MD a Little Brown Series book  This level 
of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to 
vitamin A toxicity  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative 
approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach as you will see later in 
this post  Between ugdl and ugdl you should have plenty 
of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your dietheadache 
redness of the skin hair loss joint pain

I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they 
had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear 
signs that the liver is full  You will never really know if the patient 
needs the vitamin Abecause you can not measure the pool in liver but you 
will always know when it's time to stopjust like in those vitamin A for 
PMS studies

Betacarotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will 
never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of betacarotene to 
retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow downstops in the 
liver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol  But 
taking Betacarotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to 
fill the liver upI've seen estimates of  years if you are in the  
that only has as much as you were born with in your liverIU  One 
other problem with betacarotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not 
convert as much betacarotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the 
enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc  In addition the release of 
retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will 
cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A

Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection  The body 
uses vitamin Aretinol for many different things  Visionthe first to be 
nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyde
retinal and alcoholretinol form of vitamin A  Reproduction uses the 
retinol form  and some retinal  Infection and cancer protection uses 
retinoic acid  How do you convert retinolwhich your white blood cells 
and the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid  You use enzymes 
one of which requires vitamin Cthis is why Pauling has tried to pull the 
title of antiinfection vitamin away from vitamin A  Vitamin C does play 
a role in infectioninterferon production for example but it's biggest role 
is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid  If you increase your intake 
of vitamin C you will increase your formation of retinoic acid  But 
retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinolas retinal can and once 
it's formed it's used and then lost to the body  This is why the  NRC 
group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's

Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are 
helping themselves  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and 
they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A they actually do 
themselves more harm than good

Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation
In the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus 
production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from 
entering the blood system  The mucus membrane is referred to as the first 
line defense against infection  For cancer retinoic acid has been shown 
to act as a cell brakeit counteracts the effect of cell promoters which 
stimulate cells to divide  Cancer has two distinct steps DNA alteration 
and cell promotion  For cells that normally divide all the time promoters 
are not that important  But for lung and breast tissue which does not 
normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant process
This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials 
in progress using retinol andor betacarotene

Chronic infectionirritation of the mucus membranes is a signal that 
vitamin A may not be adequate  I tell my students that any patient who 
walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be 
worked up for vitamin Aalong with the other factors that medicine already 
has on it's list of causes for chronic infection  I drive this home in my 
course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa when I teach at the allopathic 
medical school in TulsaOU's branch campus and when I give CME lectures

Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night 
vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to IU of retinol  The 
serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver 
reserves drop below  to IU  Asking a patient if they have 
trouble seeing at night is a good initial screenif cataracts are ruled 
out  In one study done on US SpanishAmericans where serum retinol levels 
were measured  of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 
ugdl

As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of 
the US that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably 
see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low 
serum retinol levels

What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A  Here are excerpts
from their book

Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for 
growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for 
reproduction embryonic development and bone growth  Proteincalorie 
malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and 
metabolism of vitamin A  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid 
which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not 
in reproduction or vision  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A 
status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum  The normal 
range for vitamin A content for a child is  to ugdl  Lower values are 
indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores  Serum levels greater 
than ugdl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A  Dark adaptation 
tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to 
perform on young children  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to 
vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state  The 
bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal 
tract and sweat glands are adversely affected  A daily intake of more than 
mgabout IU of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts 
over mgIU can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation 
erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostois
bony depositis headaches anorexia edema and fatigue  

They recommend mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A 
deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults  Their toxic serum retinol 
level is very conservative  I recommend that my students try IU in 
adults that are having problems with chronic infection  They have to rule 
out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc runor if their clinical 
lab can't run it I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest give 
them the zinc along with the vitamin A  At IU per day toxicity 
should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the 
patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol

Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A
Recall that the PMS papers were using IU to IU of vitamin A
I don't suggest that my students use these high doses  If you wanted to 
fill the liver up fastas part of a clinical trial and were monitoring the 
serum retinol level then you would be okay  But my knowledge of the 
vitamin A literature suggests to me that IU for patients with a 
demonstrated vitamin A deficitdark adapatation test or serum retinol will 
provide a good and steady improvementas long as zinc and vitamin C status 
are good without having to worry about toxicity  If they want to get more 
agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol  But 
vitamin Aretinol should never be given in high dose to women who could 
become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human 
fetus  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 
IU of retinol per day  Betacarotene will never have this effect on 
the human fetus

Could just taking Betacarotene instead of retinol supplements help  Yes 
but the effect will take a long time to develop  My advise is to use 
retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to betacarotene to keep it 
full  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to 
prescription by doctors  But when we have the MD's in this newsgroup 
jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A 
supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress I 
think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market 
but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general 
public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation

I am quite near sighted

I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal
holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment In my
left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the
laser was used to weld this back in place as well

My right eye seems fine In my left eye I was seeing occasional
flashes of bright light prior to the treatment Since the
treatment two weeks these flashes are now occuring more often
 several each hour

The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the
vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it He
says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own
accord  if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment

I am seeking via scimed additional info on retinal detachments
The Dr did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations
so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide Of most
interest to me

If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course
of action

If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is
the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect
afterwards

Do the symptoms fairly frequent flashes imply that detachment
maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm

Many thanks

Well I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with
sleep disturbances because antihistamines only help induce sleep when
they're used intermittently they lose their sedative effect if they're
used on a nightly basis  Their anticholinergic effects drying of secretions
relaxing effects on smooth muscle can be problematic in some people such as
those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement

Antihistamines like diphenhydramine Benadryl or doxylamine Unisom
are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally  Chlorpheniramine
ChlorTrimeton is said to be less sedative but mg seems to work
well in some people  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long
halflives compared to diphenhydramine and so may produce a residual
hangover or drugged feeling the next morning

This is ridiculous and your doctor sounds like a nut if what is
reported here is what the doctor actually said  If your wife's
pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic she'll
need insulin replacement  That doesn't mean she's dependent on
insulin anymore than she was beforehandif her body doesn't make
enough she'll have to get it elsewhere  Oral thyroid replacement
hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism and
it's really the only effective therapy available anyway  Plus it's
cheap  Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your
thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone but that's a
feature not a bug and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of
hypothyroidism because her problem that her gland isn't producing
enough  There isn't a clinical phenomenon of thyroid insufficiency
caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone
analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of
prolonged administration of corticosteroids so there should be no
worry about inappropriately suppressing the thyroid gland

The last couple of 
monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath sp and been given
some drops to reactivate either her thyroidal gland andor the 
'messagecenter' in the brain sorry about the approximate language
but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are but the 
brainarea is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian 

Homeopathy is nonsense  Tell her to stop wasting her money health and time
and get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make
a proper diagnosis and recommend the right therapy

One question I do have  a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated
a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining
trapped water  said he told swimmers to do this after swimming too  It
works but it stings like the devil so I've always been content to let any
water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get
out by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick  Any
comments

Perhaps diluting the rubbing alcohol in some water until you
feels comfortable will do the trick

But after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights doesn't it start
to have a paradoxical effect  I used to take one every night for
allergies and couldn't figure out why I developed bad insomnia  Finally
figured out it was the antihistamines  I would fall asleep for a few
minutes but would awaken at the drop of a pin a little later and could not
get back to sleep  I don't have that problem since I stopped the
antihistamines at bedtime

Hi scimed folks

I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium

I have a  year old son that lives with my exwife  She has been having
difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin Tofranil and now
wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion  I would like to 
know whatever is important that I should know  I worry about this sort of
thing and would like proscons regarding Lithium therapy

I have a booklet from the Lithium Information Center based at the 
University of Wisconsin but feel that it is prolithium and would be
interested in comments from the not necessarily PRO side of the fence

I am a concerned father and just wish to be well informed

Thanks for any information you can provide

Please email me directly

Friend's unpleasant experience uring CT scan deleted
Is there anything I can do about these pigs 

I'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to the
hospital administrator Specify the date and time If possible the
names of the technicians 

Send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was
admitted I say this because though your friend has no argument
with the doctor I have found that administrators sometimes ignore
complaints until the patient becomes litigious Clinicians may not
have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find
themselves named in a suit

If there is no response within a week send a follow up letter
Attach a photocopy of the original letter Do this weekly until you
do get a response

CAT scans are noninvasive but they can be very scary The scanner
can be a bad place for the claustrophobic There was an interesting
study in the BMJ about  years ago which found that around  of
people who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would
never have another This compares with  who said the same about a
lumbar puncture

How is it that placebos are legal  It would seem to me that if as a patient
you purchase a drug you've been prescribed and it's just sugar or whatever
there's a few legal complications that arise

	 
If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren't given accepted
treatment for it it seems like intentional medical malpractice

	
A placebo should fall legally under the label of quackery why not

	
Getting what you pay for  Deceptive bait and switch to an extreme  False
advertising  what if McDonalds didn't put  pure beef in their hamburgers


	So I'm mystified  Are these assumptions erred  If they aren't why the
hell can a doctor knowingly or unknowingly prescribe a placebo

Thanks

I originally posted this to altsuicideholiday but it was recommended
that I try you guys instead

My friend insists that NyQuil can be deadly if enough is taken  he
suggested something like  of the Nighttime gelcaps would do someone
in  Being a NORMAL user of NyQuil  I checked the 'ingredients' and
have a very hard time believing it  They are

 g acetaminophen
 mg Pseudoephedrine HCl
 mg Dextromethorphan HBr
 mg Doxylamine Succinate

per softgel

Can someone settle our bet a package of NyQuil of course   what 
effect would  of these babies have

Recently I completed a  week juice fast with  days of water and had
two colonics as part of it  My motivation was primarily spiritual to
detoxify from all the crap I've been putting in my body not like thats
enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect  Personaly I
didn't find it an uncomfortable experience the colonic lost about
lbs of beer belly which hasn't come back over the last month and
feel great  One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was
seeing my  year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis  from
years of indulgence

Why should it  Placebos are effective under certain circumstances  That's
why they're used  

Actually I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a sugar pill
I don't know how it could be done since prescription drugs are always
labeled and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the
name

It's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something just
not for what you have  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most
common such placebo 

	
Getting what you pay for  Deceptive bait and switch to an extreme  False
advertising  what if McDonalds didn't put  pure beef in their hamburgers

I'm not sure what you mean by this  What do you think you're paying for
You're not entitled to a prescription drug just because you pay for a
doctor's appointment

Claude I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A
retinol could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damageusually caused by 
high sound levels but also occassionally due to severe infection  The 
types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells 
and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing 
process  The hair cell nervelike epithelial cells in the ear may respond 
to vitamin A during cellular differentiationembryogenesis but I don't 
know if they are still capable of responding in adults  If they are 
capable of responding with new hair growth this would be a very major 
breakthrough in hearing loss  With all of the medical interest in vitamin 
A it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using 
vitamin A to reverse hearing loss  But with only a news announcement to go 
onand this type of communication is notoriously bad I can't comment on 
your question anymore than I already have  If one study has been done 
more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing 
loss if there really is one

Is there any relation between thyroid deficiency and depression

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic
depression or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get
depressed but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the
thyroid that would cause depression Note that weight gain is usually
a symptom of both Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid
condition is present

I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output
but I would tend to doubt it As far as I know clinical depression is
caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain and that chemical
imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body A regular
everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the
body at all

The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone TSH
on the level of circulating Thyroxin there are two types T and T 
one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other active form in
the liver The ratio of T  T can be affected by a number of other
hormones estrogen for example Naturally changing activity of the
body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin but
the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in
short order

Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual a physician's
reference book  although reading it is enough to get one depressed 
and the Encyclopedia Brittanica should be available in your local
library

I hope this has been of some help

   There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss  The
  few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher
 ently biased the investigators were making money from marketing it
   Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either The claim is that chromium
 will increase muscle mass and decrease fat  Of course chromium is also used t
 o cure diabetes high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletesjust
 as well as anabolic steroids Sounds like snake oil for the 's 



Where are your references  I have been unable to find studies that state
that chromium cures diabetese  It can reduce the amount of insulin you
have to take  High blood pressure  I have never heard of this claim
before   anabolic steroids  I have also never heard of this claim
before  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth
for God knows what reason  Did somebody piss you off at one time



  On the other hand it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet and place
 bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic



I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely
to make a fat person thin  But it can be the decisive component
of an overall strategy for longterm weight control and make an
important contribution to good health  It is important to
exercise   and also avoid fat calories  

Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase
lean muscle     I will not bore you with the
statistics  You wouldn't believe these anyway

Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of
the essential mineral chromium  Chromium plays a vital role
in sensitizing the body's tissues to the hormone insulin
Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity
to insulin and thus in turn makes it harder to lose
weight 

Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards
protein breakdown in muscles    This protein sparing
effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets
as insulin levels decline which results in loss of muscle
and organ tissue  By sensitizing muscle to insulin
chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters
so that they burn more fat and less muscle  Preservation
of lean body mass has an important longterm positive
effect on metabolic rate helping dieters keep off the
fat they've lost

Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding
the thermogenic heat producing effects of insulin
Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability
of food calories so it's not at all surprising that insulin 
stimulates metabolism     Note that I did not say
that chromium picolinate increases metabolism

In summary you need to change your life style in order to
loose weight and stay healthy

  A Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than  of calories
      Eating fat makes you fat

  B Increase dietary fiber
      low in calories high in nutrients

  C Get regular aerobic exercise at least  times a week
      burn calories

  D Take chromium picolinate daily
      lose fat keep muscle

 My friend insists that NyQuil can be deadly if enough is taken  he
 suggested something like  of the Nighttime gelcaps would do someone
 in  Being a NORMAL user of NyQuil  I checked the 'ingredients' and
 have a very hard time believing it  They are
 
  g acetaminophen
        
  mg Pseudoephedrine HCl
  mg Dextromethorphan HBr
  mg Doxylamine Succinate
 per softgel
 
 Can someone settle our bet a package of NyQuil of course   what 
 effect would  of these babies have

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this
OTC medication  A single dose of acetaminophen of  grams or greater
can cause hepatotoxicity and doses of  grams or more are
potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis  If I recall
correctly the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
involves Nhydroxylation to Nacetylbenzoquinoneimine which
is a highly reactive intermediate which then reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione  When hepatic
glutathione is used up this intermediate then starts
attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
necrosis  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
delay  days between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
damage  This is NOT a nice way to die

As to taking  of these tablets that comes to  grams
of acetaminophen  In a normal adult this would probably
cause nausea vomiting abdominal pain and loss of appetite

You can try
adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
the wax  Do this for a couple days then try syringing again  It is also
safe to point your ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse
it out

About six years ago my ears clogged up with wax probably as a
result of to much headphone use  Anyway the clinic that cleaned
them out used the following procedure

 Inject olive oil into ears
 Prevent leakage of oil with cotton
 Come back in an hour
 Rinse ears with warm vater forcefully injected
   into ear very strange sensation
 Done

They had special tools to do this and were evidently quite
familiar with the problem Very large steel syringe  Special
bowl with cutout for ear to take the grime coming out without
spillage

Good Luck

It's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something just
not for what you have  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most
common such placebo 

And presumably this is a matter of degree it must be common to prescribe
a drug that has some chance of giving some benefit but not a high

   A good source of information on Burzynski's method is in The Cancer Industry
   by pulitzerprize nominee Ralph Moss

Interesting What book got Moss the pulitzer nomination None of the
flyers for his books mention this and none of the Cancer Chronicle
Newsletters that I have mention this either

   Also a nonprofit organization called People Against Cancer
   which was formed for the purpose of allowing cancer patients to
   access information regarding cancer therapies not endorsed by the
   cancer industry but which have shown highly promising results all
   of which are nontoxic

Moss is People Against Cancer's Director of Communications People
Against Cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information not
exactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn to Most
maybe all of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern
treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer and
many of the treatments are quite dangerous as well

   Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current 
   status of his research would be appreciated

Burzynski's work is not too promising None of his A through A
antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against
experimental cancer The NCI conducted tests of A and A against
leukemia in mice with the result that doses high enough to produce
toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth
of the tumor or killing it These were in  and 

Burzynski claims that A is the active factor common to all of A
and A something which he has not shown A has only been
extracted from A He also hasn't shown that A through A are actually
distinct substances The NCI conducted a series of tests using A
against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines
from tumors in the following classes leukemia nonsmallcell and
smallcell lung cancer colon cancer cancer of the central nervous
system melanoma ovarian cancer and renal cancer A exhibited
neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested

It is necessary to process A since it is not soluble Burzynski's
theory requires soluble agents but this basically hydrolizes it to
PAG which he calls AS  PAG is not an information carrying
peptide something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for
antineoplastic activity AS  also derived from A is a 
mixture of PA and PAG PA also not a peptide can be purchased at a
chemical supply houses for about  a gram A is chemically
extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide both of which are
habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy The nasty effects
of thalidomide are widely known In spite of this similarity A
does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce
teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy

Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory early
research past and present support by others for his work have been
shown to be untrue

I saw a printed up flyer that stated the person was a
licensed herbologist and iridologist
What are your opinions
How much can you tell about a person's health by looking into their eyes


Its bogus  See the sciskeptic FAQ I edit it

You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes  Glaucoma is the
Classic Example but there are probably others

Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes  By
looking at the patterns striations and occasional blobs in the irises
you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body

The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are

 How does it work

 What evidence is there

The answer to question  takes a little knowledge of medicine to
evaluate  I don't know about iridology but I've read a book on
reflexology which is a remarkably similar notion except that the
organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet  There are
supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or
energy of some sort  Anatomists have found no such structures
Always beware the words channel and energy in any spiel put out
by an alternative practitioner

The answer to question  is rather simpler  If all they have is
anecdotal evidence then forget it  Ask for referreed papers in
mainstream medical journals  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of
rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners  Studies are done
and papers are published  Some of them are even positive

The word licensed in the flyer is an interesting one  Licensed by
whom  For what  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and
requires a license you can kill someone by giving them the wrong
plants to eat and many plants contain very powerful drugs Foxglove
and Willow spring to mind  It is not clear whether the license
extends to the iridology and I suspect that if you ask you will be
told that it means Licensed herbologist and iridologist

BTW the usual term is herbalist  Why use a different word

Hello
I heard that a certain disease toxoplasmosys is transmitted by cats which
can harm the unborn fetus Does anybody know about it Is it a problem to 
have a cat in the same apartment


See the recpetscats FAQ or any doctor or vet for more information

I am not any of the above but we do have a couple of cats

It is transmitted through the fecal matter so a pregnant woman should
avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before
preparing or eating meals  The latter is sound advice at any time of
course

Apart from that its no great problem  You certainly do not need to
get rid of your cats

There can be But depression is not diagnositic of thyroid deficiency
Thyroid blood tests are easy cheap and effective in diagnosing thyroid
deficiencies

Can anyone out there tell me the difference between a persistent disease
and a chronic one For example persistent hepatitis vs chronic
hepatitis

I don't think there is a general distinction  Rather there are
two classes of chronic hepatitis chronic active hepatitis and chronic
persistent hepatitis  I can't think of any other disease where the
term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic

Much as these two terms chronic active and chronic persistent
sound fuzzy the actual distinction between the two conditions
is often fairly fuzzy as well

I beg to differ  Chronic active hepatitis implies that the disease
remains active and generally leads to liver failure  At the very
minimum the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes what some

I have two quations to ask

  Does it cause the body any harm if one picks one's nose  For example
might it lead to a loss of ability to smell

  Is it harmful for one to eat one's nose pickings

 I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to

    But no one or at least not many people are trying to pass off God
as a scientific fact  Not so with Kirlian photography  I'll admit that
it is possible that some superior intelligence exists elsewhere and if
people want to label that intelligence God I'm not going to stop
them  Anyway let's not turn this into a theological debate  

 I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to

 George Paap

I've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery
and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme  Ordinary massage
is intended to make a person feel better especially if they have muscular
or joint problems  But  like chiropracty  there are some practitioners
who take the technique to a far extreme invoking what seems to me to be
quack science to justify their technique

In the case of massage there is a technique called deep abdominal massage
in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines
The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the
intestines and putrifies releasing poisons which cause various disease
syndromes  By this vigorous and painful procedure it is alleged that
these deposits can be loosened up and passed out

I just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it  The human intestine
is not a New York City sewer pipe  And even if it were you eat half of
a small box of Triscuits and there ain't gonna be nothin' sticking to the
inner surface of your intestine

of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact and I lack
belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no
reason for me to believe in these  I usually use the word
agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of
a god is unknown inherently unknowable  Note that this is a

This is a cross post to recgardens and scimed Set the followup

email directly to me cecilysatorliuse

I have a problem with wasps  they seem to love me Last summer I
couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden
before one or several wasps would come for me I am asking for advice
on how to repel wasps

   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one
of my tiny ponds The caretaker poor fellow will have to take care
of them and that will give me a head start on them Last year we
couldn't find any nest Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest
in my tiny garden of  square meter other wasps will most likely vie
for the territory Is there anything I can grow rub on my skin or
spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards
Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved
plants I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone
else

   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath The wasps seem
to come to drink at them and I suppose that their prey will breed in
them The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps because as soon
as the wasp season starts they stop coming to have their bath

Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from  wasps they
seem to love me The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about
wasps is to stand still and not wave my arms I've got some painful
stings when trying to follow that advice I have also tried to use
hygienic products without perfumes to no avail They still love me
and come for me even when I'm in the middle of a crowd So far only
two things seem to work To kill it dead or to run into the house and
close all doors and windows 

NB I don't have a problem with bees or bumblebees just wasps

Precisely  One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that
could be causing difficulty with his behavior  Standard practice would
be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist  One would want to
rule out the possibility that the bad behavior is not psychiatric
illness at all

Can anyone out there tell me the difference between a persistent disease
and a chronic one For example persistent hepatitis vs chronic
hepatitis

I don't think there is a general distinction  Rather there are
two classes of chronic hepatitis chronic active hepatitis and chronic
persistent hepatitis  I can't think of any other disease where the
term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic

Much as these two terms chronic active and chronic persistent
sound fuzzy the actual distinction between the two conditions
is often fairly fuzzy as well

I beg to differ  Chronic active hepatitis implies that the disease
remains active and generally leads to liver failure  At the very
minimum the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes what some
call transaminitis  Chronic persistant hepatitis simply means that
the patient has HbSag in hisher blood and can transmit the infection but
shows no evidence of progressive disease  If I had to choose I'd much
rather have the persistant type


Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic
persistent anything Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical
biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronic
persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellular
carcinoma

Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis CPH are probably the result of
a viral infection although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be
determined The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy It
consists of findings of portal inflammation an intact periportal limiting
plate and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis But in contrast
to chronic active hepatitis CAH there is no periportal inflammation 
bridging necrosis or fibrosis 

CPH has indeed an excellent prognosis If I had to choose between CAH and
CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH However as David pointed
out the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have
it The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsies showing
areas compatible with both CPH and CAH Maybe it is a sampling problem Maybe
it is a continuum I don't know

Mark this is the most reasonable post that I've seen in Sci Med on the 
topic of Colonic Flushing  I'm in a profession that uses manipulationa 
very refined form of massage to treat various human diseases  Proving 
that manipulation works has been extremely difficultas the MD's delight in 
pointing out  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better 
progress than the chiropractors in provingscientifically that their 
techingues work  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation 
to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or 
better than drug treatmentusing physiological measurements and not just 
the woman's preception of improvement  This study was hailed by the JAOA 
editors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove 
itself to the medical community

I'm currently trying to get the AOAAmerican Osteopathic Association which 
has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the US to also support 
nutrition education and research  I've pointed out in a grant proposal 
that the founder of Osteopathic MedicineAT Still embraced both diet and 
manipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing 
only drugsStill was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs 
during his service in the Civil War  He decided that there had to be a 
better way to treat human disease since he saw the curedrugs as being 
worse than the disease  Through his many years of study of the human body 
he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his 
students in the US's first Osteopathic Medical school  We now have 
Still used manipulation to treatand also diagnose human disease but he 
used diet to prevent human disease  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic 
Profession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punchso to 
speak  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little 
understanding of how diet affects human health  This has to change

I think Americans are QUITE hung up about sex and the involved plumbing

Cute anecdote but hardly indicative of the population  From the responses
I've received to that post all from men by the way I get the impression
that unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the
need or desire strikes then that person is very hung up on sex

With tv programs about boobs Seinfeld and masturbation again Seinfeld
and with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage
pregnancy rate and the high abortion rate here in the States I would
not assume that we American's are frightened of sex  Rather we are a bit
stupid about it  Healthy sexuality does not require flamboyance or
promiscuity  It requires responsibility

Partial deletion

potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis  If I recall
correctly the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
involves Nhydroxylation to Nacetylbenzoquinoneimine which
is a highly reactive intermediate which then reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione  When hepatic
glutathione is used up this intermediate then starts
attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
necrosis  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
delay  days between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
damage  This is NOT a nice way to die

Nice explanation except that it isn't Nhydroxylation that causes the
formation of the Nacetylpbenzoquinone imine NAPQI but rather a
direct twoelectron oxidation In addition there is one school of thought
that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein
is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen  

As far as drug toxicities go acetaminophen has and continues to be one
of the most intensely scrutinized An excellent recent review of the topic
can be found in 

	Vermeulen Bessems and Van de Straat 	
	Molecular Aspects of Paracetamolinduced hepatotoxicity and its
	MechanismBased Prevention Drug Metabolism Reviews  
	 

	Acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in Europe

I couldn't agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic
dose of acetaminophen causes  I've heard a number of descriptions by
physicians associated with poison control centers and they describe a
lingering very painful death

     I posted about a pulse of relaxation electricity  I now think
it more like a pulse of relaxation or comfort than a pulse of
electricity  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling
of comfort such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful

     Another thing  When you sleep you lie down facing up with your
palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed  Then you
relax and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh  So
you feel a shiver below the surface of the skin not heartbeat
Then this shiver increases and comes up to your head and the roam you
hear loudens  Note that you always hear a highpitch when you lie down
in bed this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear  This
roam is different from the high pitch but follows the shiver of your
body

     Shiver is not the word  It may be called a mild vibration or quake
What is this shiver and roam  Can I use this to induce outofbody
experience

Hello all

          There is a small problem a friend of mine is experiencing and I 
would appreciate any help at all with it

My friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring 
antidepressants for a cure The main problem is the side effects of these 
So far she has been prescribed Prozac Aurorix and tryptanol all with 
different but unbearable side effects

The Prozac gave very bad anxietyjitters and insomina it was impossible to 
sit still for more than a minute or so

The Aurorix whilst having a calming effect all feelings were lost and the 
body coordination was similar to a drunken person Her brain was clouded 
over

The tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco 
ordination occurred She did not know what she was doing as her brain was 
closed down

Has anyone had similar problems andor have any suggestions as to the next 
step

Thankyou in advance

Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic
persistent anything Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical
biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronic
persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellular
carcinoma

Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis CPH are probably the result of
a viral infection although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be
determined The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy It
consists of findings of portal inflammation an intact periportal limiting
plate and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis But in contrast
to chronic active hepatitis CAH there is no periportal inflammation 
bridging necrosis or fibrosis 

CPH has indeed an excellent prognosis If I had to choose between CAH and
CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH However as David pointed
out the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have
it The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsies showing
areas compatible with both CPH and CAH Maybe it is a sampling problem Maybe
it is a continuum I don't know

Darn  Just when I think I understand something someone who knows the
pathology has to burst my bubble   We'd better not start talking about
glomerular diseases then I'll really get depressed

Seriously though I wonder how someone with CPH would end up getting a
biopsy in the first place  My understanding and feel free to correct me
is that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated with overall normal
hepatic function  I would think that the only clue might be a history of
prior HepB infection and a positive HepBsAg  Or is it indeed on a
continuum with CAH and the distinction merely one of pathology and
prognosis but otherwise identical clinical features

 The Prozac gave very bad anxietyjitters and insomina it was impossible to

I tried Prozac a few months ago and had some insomnia from it but no
anxiety or jitters  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the
Prozac had done any good but it only provided a tiny benefit  Maybe
because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a
mg dose didn't work

Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft another serotonin
reuptake inhibitor like Prozac  One pillday mg seemed to help some 
Now I'm trying mgday  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than
Prozac  I think my doctor said that only  of the people taking Zoloft
have to discontinue it because of side effects  The only problem I'm
having is some minor GI distress but nothing too annoying  Hopefully the
Zoloft will work  Maybe your friend should try this one next

My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin
drugs usually Prozac  If that works great  If it works but has too many
side effects try Zoloft or maybe Paxil  If the serotonin drugs don't work
at all try one of the tricyclics like desipramine

suggestions as to the next step

Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big
difference  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have much
experience in this area and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe
him  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my
family practitioner's office

Disclaimer I'm not a doctor what I know about this comes from talking to
my psychiatrist and reading scimed

Without restating the thread going here

Zoloft is a stimulating antidepressant

It is unfortunate that antidepressant therapy is trial and error but
if it is any help there are a lot of people using the side effects of
the many medications to help manage other conditions

Hang in there maybe someday a brain chemistry set will be available
and all the serotonin questions will have answers

Please no flamesI have enough to deal with

 But after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights doesn't it start
 to have a paradoxical effect  I used to take one every night for
 allergies and couldn't figure out why I developed bad insomnia  

Insomnia is a known but relatively infrequent sideeffect of
diphenhydramine  

For most people this does not occur  On the other hand most people
can build up a tolerance to an antihistamine with extended use
Allergy sufferers are often switched from one antihistamine to
another to avoid this

It may be a good way to catch a cold  It's easy to pick up cold

Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver
biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months
after a bout of acute viral hepatitis or when someone is found to have
persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests The degree of
elevation in the serum transaminases can be trivial or as much as ten times
normal Other blood chemistries are usually normal 
As a rule patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease 
Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at
least initially and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of
a biopsy The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured The patient with
CAH needs to be treated

Our month son has started falling sick quite often every since he
started going to day care  He was at home for the first year and he did
not fall sick even once  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
flu pretty much once a month  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear
infection as well with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
 weeks out of   I know kids in day care fall sick more often but we
are beginning to wonder how often more often really is whether our
son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average what the
longerterm effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are
and what we can do to build up his resistance  He really enjoys his day
care and we think it's great too but we are beginning to wonder whether
we should think about getting a nanny

Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions

 How often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick
How often do they get colds flus ear infections  Is there any data on
home care vs day care

 Does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later
does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later or does it
not have any long term effect

 Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
term effects

 How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
normal and what does one do about it

 Is there any way to build immunity and resistance

Any data information or advice relating to this would be much
appreciated  Thanks a lot

I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke and
that it also makes the heart pumb slower in order to make up for the
greater volume My Internist who diagnosed my AV block slow heart rate
and PVC's told me something different She says that heart rate is
associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle not its
size Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume but the
effects are unrelated except for their common source The AV block she
asserts is another electrical effect which is irreversable  even when
exercise is dicontinued PVC's are also common in runners 

So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart
patients Isn't that strange though Are there any notsobeneficial
aspects to athlete's heart Is it all good

Not worried just curious

 are beginning to wonder how often more often really is whether our

 Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or st grade infection 
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower  Some studies suggest 
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial 
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and 
mortalitymumps measles etc

  How often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick
 How often do they get colds flus ear infections  Is there any data on
 home care vs day care

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care

  Does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later
 does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later or does it
 not have any long term effect

Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity  But many viruses 
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response
new antibody production  In addition antibody levels tend to decline 
with time and reinnoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high
Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression 
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children

  Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
 term effects

Yes chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good 
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body  Health effects 
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the 
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects 
of chronic antibiotic use a view that I do not support
 
  How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
 normal and what does one do about it

Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up in my 
opinion  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is 
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many 
infectious diseases  I do not share this view and there are some 
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection 
frequency and severity  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to 
result in a severe infection  A strong immune response can minimize the 
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms 
associated with the infection

  Is there any way to build immunity and resistance

There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong 
immune response to infectious agents  They are protein vitamin C 
vitamin A iron and zinc  The American diet is not low in protein so this 
is rarely a problem  But vitamin A vitamin C iron and zinc are often low 
and this lack of an adequate poolnutrient reserve can impair the immune 
response  Iron is know to be low in most kidsas is vitamin A  There are 
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of 
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe 
infection  Serum ferritin for iron status dark adaptation for vitamin A 
status red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for 
vitamin C status  I have attempted to work up posts on these five 
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the 
others that I participate in  I can email you what I've worked up so far
But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the 
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response  You may also 
be able to get help from a nutritionist  Anyone can call themselves a 
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull  You want to find someone
like myself who has had some formal training and education in nutrition
Many PhD programs in the US now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's 
what you need to look for  Some dieticians will also call themselves 
nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training 
needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests  They are very good 
for getting general dietary advice from however

 Any data information or advice relating to this would be much
 appreciated  Thanks a lot

Moss is People Against Cancer's Director of Communications People
Against Cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information not
exactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn to

And where do you advise people to turn for cancer information


 Most
maybe all of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern
treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer and
many of the treatments are quite dangerous as well

It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization Who
has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable Could
it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing
to be operating with major vested interests Whether one believes that these
vested interests are real or not or whether or not they actually shape medical
research is a seperate argument If one sees a possibility however that these
interests exist then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC
has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight

As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons the fact that the NIH didn't
find them effective doesn't make much sense here Of course they didn't I
tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after
being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon They are fighting
like hell to keep that clinic open and they credit his treatment with their
survival Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna
tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find
ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless

My doc handed me mg samples of CLARITIN brand of Ioratadine Tablet
from Schering Corp  I tried to find it in the PDR to no avail I
do remember she mentioned this drug was relatively new to the US but
available overseas for quite some time

Looking mostly for sideeffect contraindications and mode of action 
such that it differs from Seldane and Hismanal

Email or newsgroup is fine Thanx in advance

   Does it cause the body any harm if one picks one's nose  For example
 might it lead to a loss of ability to smell
 
   Is it harmful for one to eat one's nose pickings

I've seen children do this and wondered about something  If the
mucus in one's nose collects filters particles going into the
airway if a child then picks and ingests this material might
it have a vaccinatory effect since if the body ingests airborne
diseases or other 'stuff' on the mucus the body might generate
antibodies for this small invasion

Maybe this is why some children don't get sick very often

Our month son has started falling sick quite often every since he
started going to day care  He was at home for the first year and he did
not fall sick even once  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
flu pretty much once a month  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear
infection as well with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
 weeks out of   I know kids in day care fall sick more often but we


Sounds pretty familiar  I posted similar cries about last September when
Caroline just entered daycare  She was two then and have been with 
continuous colds since until last March  As spring approaches her colds
slowed down  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds
Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she
had antibiotics  The other time was due to sinus infection and I wished
that I did not give her that awful Septra 

Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions

There are the 'net studies'  that is if you read this newsgroup often
there will be a round of questions like this every month  There might
be formal studies like that but bear with my not so academic experience
Okay

 How often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick
How often do they get colds flus ear infections 

Gee I bet  you'll hear cases in all these catagories

 Is there any data on home care vs day care

I am pretty sure an insulated child at home sicks less  But that child 
still will face the world one day 


 Does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later

That's what I believe and comfort myself with  Caroline will get more
and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other 
kid's mouth nor let other kids do the same  Cold virus mutate easily
However I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these
diseases so she would be less severely affected  Everytime she has a cold
we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp 
at night so she can have good rest thanks to some suggestions from the net
That's about all the care she needs from us  I try very hard to keep her
off antibiotics  Twice her ped gave me choice to decide whether she would
have antibiotics  I waited just long enough  days to see that she
fought the illness off  I do understand that you don't have much choice if
the child is in pain andor high fever 

does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later or does it
not have any long term effect

If the child doesn't rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime
then the child should be stronger


 Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
term effects
 
I'll leave this to expert

 How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
normal and what does one do about it

If your child just entered daycare I'm pretty sure the first  months will be
the hardest  Then you get more used to it  Boy do I hate to see me typing
this sentence  I recall when I read something like this last September I said 
to myself 'oh sure'  But I do get used to it now  However I do hear 
people say that it does get better after a year or two  I am looking forward 
to a healthier next winter  As it gets warmer I hope you do get some break 
soon

 Is there any way to build immunity and resistance

Eat well sleep well  Try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary

Good luck

Wenlin

 Hi all
 
 My skin is very dry in general But the most serious part is located
 from knees down The skin there looks like segmented The segmentation
 actually happens beneath the skin I would like to know if there is any
 cure for this
 

As a matter of fact I just saw a dermatologist the other day and while I 
was there I asked him about dry skin I'd been spending a small fortune
on various creams lotions and other dry skin treatments
He said all I needed was a large jar of vaseline Soak in a lukewarm tub
of water for  minutes ONLY  minutes then massage in the vaseline
to trap the moisture in 

That is the standard advice in dermatology texts
The soak part greatly increases the inconvenience  Don't bother unless
it doesn't work otherwise

The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the
vaseline properly 

Exactly but it adds to the ritual aspect which is important for
us suggestible patients  Posters don't bother to repeat the 
rationale for the soak

If it's not done right you remain greasy and stick

Greasy no matter what Vaseline generically petrolatum is 
famous for that  One text states that the more greasy a dryskin
cream is the more effective  

Try it It's got to be cheaper then spending  for  oz of 'natural'
lotion

Try USP lanolin at least for maintenance preventive therapy  USP
lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap don't buy the more
expensive perfumed lanolin mixture  As I've commented before petrolatum
is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in
biological systems that is not inherently bad but smell it up close
even on your hand are partially absorbed into the body and remain there
for months or more and have associations with cancer  Don't panic but
also don't believe it's God's gift to the human skin

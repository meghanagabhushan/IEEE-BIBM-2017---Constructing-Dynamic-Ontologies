 rest were killed And so it is that the whole length of the
 borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki
 from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of

Some real fighters sprang up from among the people who struck terror
 into the hearts of the Turks


Within a few months after the war began these Armenian guerrilla
 forces operating in close coordination with the Russians were
 savagely attacking Turkish cities towns and villages in the east
 massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time
 working to sabotage the Ottoman army's war effort by destroying roads
 and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to
 ease Russian occupation The atrocities committed by the Armenian
 volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the
 Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the
 fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties The memoirs of many
 Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with
 accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian
 guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of
 war then observed in such areas

 honored me by reproducing my text  Unfortunately he has still not produced
 the documents on Jews in LATVIA  Instead he asks for my views on the
 Turkish Genocide  Well that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred
 other threads  I'll let other people bring the usual charges try to debunk
 MutluArgicCosar a netwide Terrorism Triangle and their spurious evidence

 When that does ever happen look out the window to see if there is a
 nonfascist xSoviet Armenian Government in the East Now where is
 your nonexistent list of scholars What a moronian During the First
 World War and the ensuing years   the Armenian Dictatorship
 through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its
 centuriesold policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by
 savagely murdering  million Muslims and deporting the rest from
 their  year homeland

This paragraph is wellwritten and interesting Serdar baby but it has nothing
to do with Jews in LATVIA  I have not presented a list of scholars

How could you Because there is none

I am not
interested in an exSoviet why do you write x  It's very cute Armenian
Government nonfascist or otherwise  You are not responding to what I am
writing  Instead you are autoposting your own particular brand of bullshit

Like conversing with a brick wall And you are not responding to what I
am writing By the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first
instance of Genocide in the th Century acted upon an entire people
For nearly one thousand years the Turkish and Kurdish people lived
on their homeland  the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet
and Armenian occupation The persecutions culminated in  The
Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its
Muslim subjects  million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the
remainder driven out of their homeland After one thousand years
Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye

Today xSoviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by xSoviet Armenia

Today xSoviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against
humanity

xSoviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds

You have now done so four times in a row  May I legitimately conclude that
you are not indeed a regular netuser but an autoposting computer program

Source John Dewey The New Republic Vol  Nov   pp 

Happy the minority Jews which has had no Christian nation to protect it
 And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey
 when they were expelled from Europe especially Spain by Saintly Christians
 and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and
 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers To one brought up as most Americans have
 been in the Gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of
 the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious
 differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they
 were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every
 nation in the world would have treated as treasonable One readily
 reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate

He also stated that

they Armenians traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian
 invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and
 fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least
 a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population

 I want the documents of Jews in Latvia  I think several other

In April  Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city
 of Van whose  Armenians comprised  percent of the population
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the EmpireLeaving Erivan
 on April   Armenian volunteers reached Van on May  and organized
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during
 the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the
 southern side of the lake

Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories Armenian political leaders army officers and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves

With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in  at the beginning of
 World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies

Why

 Who gives a thunder about your pseudoscholar jokes I'am arguing about
 the ArmenianNazi colaboration during World War II Any comment

Argue it with someone else or do not reply to my posts Argic my love  I
am not arguing about the ArmenianNazi collaboration  I do not give a
thunder about it  I want you to do one of three things
a admit that you are not a regular user but a computer autoposting Turkish
propaganda or
b post the documents on Jews in Latvia or
c run away like the coward without a real address that you are and do not
reply to my posts

It could be perhaps your head wasn't screwed on just right In 
while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration
camps the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian
battalion to fight alongside the Nazis In  this battalion had
grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of the
former guerilla leader Dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the
shortlived Armenian Dictatorship  and the architect of the
coldblooded genocide of  million Turks and Kurds between 
An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party
leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis Encouraged by
this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of
extermination of the Jews

This ArmenianNazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they backstabbed and
exterminated  million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army

Furthermore as McCarthy put it the Armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros
Armistice with the Allies October   The Allies had decided
to create a Greater Armenia including the old Russian province
of Yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of Anatolia
claimed by the Armenian fanatics Only the area called Cilicia
around the Ottoman province of Adana was to be excluded as it
had already been claimed by the French The Allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks who
could be expected to oppose their plans

On April   the British Army occupied Kars gave civilian
and military power over to the Armenians then withdrew The British
planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship even
though the Russian prewar census had shown Kars Province to be over
 Muslim The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed but the
British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains The fate of
the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in Eastern Anatolia Murder pillage genocide and the destruction
of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of
Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the Ottoman Army The British had left
the scene to the Armenian genocide squads Therefore few
Europeans were present to observe the genocide One British
soldier Colonel Rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the
disarmament of Otoman soldiers saw what was occurring

Rawlinson wired to his superiors

in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in
 independent command of the Moslim population as their troops
 being without discipline and not being under effective control
 atrocities were constantly being committed

Instead you post more Armenian nonsense

Come again

 Armenians are entering every place evacuated by Russians carrying out
 murders cruelties rape and all kind of atrocities which cannot be

 who happen to be in the street These barbarous murders repeated
 every day with new methods continue and the Russian Army has been urged

The situation in the cities of Erzincan and Erzurum which we have
 recently taken over is given below

 These two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the
 calamities and destruction which they suffered have been destroyed
 as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of
 these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the
 destruction suffered during the twoyear Russian occupation

 All barracks buildings of Erzincan the cavalry barracks in Erzurum
 the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those
 burnt In short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down

 As to the people of these cities

 All people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the Sarikamis
 direction for road building and were slaughtered The remaining people
 were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the
 withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown
 into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens
 ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls
 and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts
 The few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than
 those of the 'Spanish Inquisition' are in poverty more dead than alive
 horrified some driven insane about  in Erzincan and  in
 Erzurum The people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had
 has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated

 The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in
 stores left over from the Russians The villages round Erzincan and
 Erzurum are in the worst condition Some villages on the road have
 been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely
 massacred

 Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that
 history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions

What are the borders the Islamic world dreams about 

The Islamic world dreams of being the whole planet but not by kicking
the current inhabitant out we rather deam of the day everybody converts
If Jews had the same dream I would not feel threatened a bit

There certainly are muslims who do not believe that their dream of
a global Islamic community should be achieved through force There are
however others and they are often far more visiblevocal than the
former who do accept the establishment of global Islam through force
I  would not feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing
Islamicization through peaceful means nor by Jews advocating the same
approach Those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's
power are certainly a threat

To Palestinians Israel is doing just that maintaining its dominance
of those outside its own group If I am told that I am not one of
you but you then impose your control on me damn right you are a threat
If I am a member of a nonmuslim minority inside the Islamic
world and actively did not accept my minority status I would also
certainly see Islam's domination as having been acheived and maintained
through the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities
within their ranks

Islamic readers I am waiting to your honest answer

I want also a honest answer from Zionists for the following questions

I am not a zionist but do feel that both Jewish and Palestinian
nationalist desires need at this juncture to be accepted in some way

why do jews who don't even believe in God as is the case with many
of the founders of secular zionism have a right in Palestine more
than the inhabitants of Palestine just because God gave you the land
						
For the same reason that some muslims believe it is proper and righteous
for Islam to be spread by force upon those who DO NOT WANT THAT

Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of
the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel

I refer to the most you also refer to
Because they are scared and feel very threatened as well feeling that
this area is to some degree part of their beliefreligionheritage
identityetc

I too strongly object to those that justify Israeli rule
of those who DO NOT WANT THAT The occupied territories are not

  why do jews who don't even believe in God as is the case with many
 of the founders of secular zionism have a right in Palestine more
 than the inhabitants of Palestine just because God gave you the land
Gd has nothing to do with it Some of the land was in fact given to the
Jews by the United Nations quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab
absentee landlords Present claims are based on prior ownership purchase
from aforementioned absentee landlords award by the United Nations in the
partition of the Palestine mandate territory and as the result of
defensive wars fought against the Egyptians Syrians Jordanians et al


 Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of
 the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel
First I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the
idea that the West Bank is theirs Since  however I agree with those who
claim the West Bank I think I can answer your question thusly the West
bank was what is called the spoils of war Hussein ordered the Arab Legion
to attack Israel which was a poor move seeing as how the Israelis
promptly kicked his butt The territory is therefore forefeit  Retaining
possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable but it beats
national suicide for the Israelis Put another way one could ask why it
is that so many Palestinians seem to think that TelAviv belongs to them
and the future state of Palestine As long as this state of affairs
continues it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they
can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea Giving up the entire West
Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint  In addition there is
the small matter of Jerusalem which is considered to be part of the West
Bank The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil Even
leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude like Yossi Sarid aren't
going to propose giving up Jerusalem If he did he'd get run out of town
on a rail

David Davidian says Turkish officials came to Armenia last September and
Armenia given assurances the Armenian nuclear plant would stay shut Turkey
promised Armenia electricity and in the middle of December  Turkey said
sorry we were only joking Armenia froze this past winter   Armenians
lost their lives Turkey claims it allowed humanitarian aid to enter Armenia
through its border with Turkey What did Turkey do it replaced the high
quality grain from Europe with crap from Turkey mixed in dirt and let that
garbage through to Armenia   Armenians lost their lives

  This is the latest from UPI

     Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told journalists Turkey was
     closing its air space to all flights to and from Armenia and would
     prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the republic overland across
     Turkish territory


   Historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited
   signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian
   populations Even the Nazis did this much

   It seems as though from now on Turkey will publicly pronounce
   themselves 'hypocrites' should they choose to continue their
   condemnation of the Serbians

Jack I happen to be Jewish and have some serious problems with the whole
situation in Israel But your exaggerations and commentary certainly don't help
to support your viewpoint Here for example you are conflating two separate
stories and exaggerating both of them

If I have confused two different stories it was an honest mistake but I do
not see why it becomes an exageration of either  They both took place and
are both equally disgusting behavior for any country let alone one that
brags constantly about democracy

If more of YOU PEOPLE would speak out instead of just hiding your disgust
in the closet  we wouldn't be having this discussion

Having said you have my heartfelt thanks and admiration for even saying
what you have said already  I suspect you will be getting more  hate
mail than support

Thanks

        I get the impression Hasan realized he goofed and is now
        trying to drop the thread Let him It might save some
        miniscule portion of his sorry face

       Not really since i am a logical person who likes furthering himself
       from any name calling i started trashing any article that contains
       such abuses without responding to and sometimes not even reading articles
       written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company
   
    Ah but in my followup on the subject which you by the way never bothered
    responding to there was no namecalling Hence the assumption
    Do you feel more up to it now so that we might have an answer
    Or to refresh your memory does the human right issue in the area
    apply to Palestinians only Also do you claim there is such a thing as
    forfeiting a human right If that's possible then explain to the rest of
    us how there can exist any such thing
   
    Use your logic and convince us This is your golden chance

    Jonas Flygare


   well  ok let's see what Master of Wisdom Mr Jonas Flygare
   wrote that can be wisdomely responded to 

Are you calling names or giving me a title If the first read your
paragraph above if not I accept the title in order to let you get into the
um well debate again


   Master of Wisdom writes in Marfrejteknikumuuse

    hasan

     flax

      hasan

         In case you didNOT know Palestineans were there for  months
         and they are coming back
         when you agree to give Palestineans their HUMANRIGHTS

         Afterall human rights areNOT negotiable

      Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the right to one's life also
      a 'human right' Or does it only apply to palestinians

     No it is EVERYBODY's right However when a killer kills then he is giving
     up willingly or unwillingly  his life's right to the society
     the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by
     depriving the killer off his life's right

    So then it's all right for Israel to kill the people who kill Israelis
    The old 'eye for an eye' thinking Funny I thought modern legal systems
    were made to counter exactly that

   So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you Master of Wsidom
							       

If you insist on giving me namestitles I did not ask for you could at
least spell them correctly sigh

   when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE
   and hence ALL their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on
   the ground of occupied territories

No I am not neglecting that I'm merely asking you whether the existance
of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right
to live a as you so eloquently put it human right We can get back to the
question of which law should be used in the territories later Also you have
not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights

   What do you expect me to tell you Master of Wisdom when I did explain my
   point in the post that you responded to The point is that since Israel
   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights
   to the Occupied Palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic
   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society

If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions then
tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all

     In conjugtion with the above when a group of people occupies others
     territories and rule them by force then this group would be willingly or
     unwillingly deprived from some of its rights

    Such as the right to live That's nice The swedish government is a group
    of people that rule me by force Does that give me the right to kill
    them

   Do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here 

Worthy or not I was just applying your logic to a related problem
Am I to assume you admit it wouldn't hold

     What kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue
     The answer is to be found in a certain system such as International law
     US law Israeli law 

    And now it's very convenient to start using the legal system to prove a
    point Excuse me while I throw up

   ok Master of Wisdom is throwing up
   You people stay away from the screen while he is doing it 

Oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone
I'll let you in on a secret It's not for real Take my word for it

     It seems that the US law represented by US State dept in this case
     is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories
     Anyway as for Hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system

    And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem

   The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem Why  because
   any system can solve it
   The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here all palestine

I asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for
all people involved I assumed that was obvious but I won't repeat that
mistake Now that I have straightened that out I'm eagerly awaiting your
reply

   Joseph Weitz administrator responsible for Jewish colonization
   said it best when writing in his diary in 
	   Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
	   peoples together in this country We shall not achieve our goal
						                  
	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country
	   The only solution is a Palestine at least Western Palestine west of
	   the Jordan river without Arabs And there is no other way than
	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to
	   transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be
	   left Only after this transfer will the country be able to
	   absorb the millions of our own brethren There is no other way out

Just a question If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to
getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
charter that's the english translations if you have other information I'd
be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to
a private paper even older I'm not going to get into the question if he
wrote the above but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
their share of fanatics Guess what Those are not the people that will
make any lasting peace in the region Ever It's those who are willing to
make a tabula rasa and start over and willing to give in order to get
something back


   We and our either refers to Zionists or Jews i donot know which

   Well i can give you an answer you Master of Wisdom I will NOT suggest the
   imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem 

   I think that is fair enough 

No that is not an answer since I asked for a system that could solve
the problem You said any could be used then you provided a contradiction
Guess where that takes your logic To nevernever land


   The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children
			   Rabbi Shoham

Oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
a real bummer when I try giving your posts any credit

The Islamic world dreams of being the whole planet but not by kicking

If Jews had the same dream I would not feel threatened a bit


So I should be very comfortable that  people want to convert me to
Islam Or to convert me to ANYTHING

There are many types of violence physical murder is only one

'Trying' to convert is an insult It's like trying to tell me that me andor
my Godmy lack of God are just crap that I need a new 'converted' one

This does not apply for muslims only of course Same for jews and for some
friendly nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches
and cheap booklets about some church 

And when the objective is I think however that you are wrong to convert
everybody it's just a matter of time when violence will occur


Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related
violence' 

Why not let 'the other more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care
your business You do assume that they are inferiour or their beliefs are
as long as you want to change their thinking

 While the Dashnaks were in power they did everything in the world to keep the
  pot boiling by attacking Kurds Turks and Tartars by committing outrages
  against the Moslems by massacring the Moslems and robbing and destroying
  their homesDuring the last two years the Armenians in Russian Caucasus

 When the Russian armies invaded Turkey after the Sarikamish disaster
  of  their columns were preceded by battalions of irregular
  Armenian volunteers both from the Caucasus and from Turkey One of
  these was commanded by a certain Andranik a bloodthirsty adventurer
  These Armenian volunteers committed all kinds of excesses more

 What are you talking about  The Rabin government has clearly
 indicated its interest in a territorial compromise that would leave
 the vast majority of the Arabs in Judea Samaria and Gaza outside
 Israeli control

just an interrupting comment here Since EARLY 's  israelis said they are
willing to give up the Adminstration rule of the occupied terretories to
Palestineans Palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies
them their right of SELFDETERMINATION period

 I know I was just pointing out that not compromising may be a bad idea And
 there are in Israel voices against negotiations And I think there are many
 among palestineans also against any negociations

 Just an opinion

 Dorin

Ok I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations However
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it

As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the socalled peace process they
are not against peace per se but rather for their wellfounded predictions
that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank and most probably the same
for Golan Heights back to the Arabs An  months of negotiations in Madrid
and Washington proved these predictions Now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for noresult negotiations
I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations what do they have to
loose 

Arabs feel that the current negotiations is ONLY for legitimizing the current
statusquo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and
oranges That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked

Just an opinion

PAINFUL SEARCH 

THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians
in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan  about
 men  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
fouryear war over Nagorny Karabakh

The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators  Hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the Baku press Diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates

The   February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of
the last moves  in their fouryear campaign to  take full control
of Nagorny Karabakh  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
in Rome on Monday The bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and  a massacre but  investigators say that most  of the
dead were civilians The awful  number of people killed was first
suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku
Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  griefstricken
Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 
dead

The State Prosecuter Aydin Rasulov  the cheif investigator of a
man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  Hojali
Disaster said  his figure of   people dead was a  minimum on
preliminary  findings  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman
Memmedov the mayor of Hojali An  even higher one was printed in
the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May   dead  people named and more
than  bodies reported unidentified  This figure of nearly 
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova the new spokeswoman
of the Azeri Ministry of Defence

FranCois Zen  Ruffinen head  of delegation of  the International
Red Cross  in Baku said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
Agdam had reported a figure of   bodies received at his mosque
from  Hojali most  of  them  civilians We  did  not count  the
bodies But  the figure seems  reasonable It is no  fantasy Mr
Zen Ruffinen said We have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead

Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
number of  dead in the  massacre Don't  get worked up  It will
take  several months  to  get a  final  figure the  yearold
lawyer said at his small office

Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things It  took him two  years to
reach  a firm  conclusion that    people were  killed and  
wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
uprising in Baku in January 

Those  nationalists the  Popular  Front finally  came to  power
three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
what  happened when  Hojali an  Azeri town  which lies  about 
miles from the border with Armenia fell to the Armenians

Officially  people have so  far been certified as dead being
the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
republic's forensic department This  is just a small percentage
of the dead said Rafiq Youssifov the republic's chief forensic
scientist They were the only bodies brought to us Remember the
chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within  hours

Of these  people  were women and  were children under 
years old  Gunshots killed   people  shrapnel killed   and
axes or  blunt instruments  killed   Exposure in  the highland
snows killed the last three  Thirtythree people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation including ears  noses breasts or penises
cut off and  eyes gouged out according  to Professor Youssifov's
report Those  bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed Mr Rasulov said

Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
disorganised   lists of   Azeri militiamen are dead  here six
policemen there  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant the
names of   corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day The
most heartbreaking account from   witnesses interviewed so far
comes  from Towfiq  Manafov  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a
helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  
February

There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly   in Hojali  people  by the stream
and the road and   visible around Nakhchivanik village Mr
Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
pilot

People waved up  to us for help We saw  three dead children and
one  twoyearold alive  by  one  dead woman  The  live one  was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up We tried to land but
Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
return

There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali
at the time  many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by Armenian forces

HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES

AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafebar on  the
Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in
his trousers torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of
Hojali just over three months ago writes Hugh Pope

I'm still  wearing the same  clothes I don't have  any others
the  yearold carpenter  said  beginning his  account of  the
Hojali disaster I was wounded in five places but I am lucky to
be alive

Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food without electricity
for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for 
days They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the
 to   people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the
edge of Karabakh

At about pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard
before  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons  artillery  heavy
machineguns the lot Mr Sadikov said

Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction
of  the  attack Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started
fleeing the town  down a hill through a stream  and through the
snow into a forest on the other side

To escape the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam
about   miles away They  thought they  were going to  make it
until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two
Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak

None of my group was hurt up to then  Then we were spotted by
a  car on  the road  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening
fire Mr Sadikov said

Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward
to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians but  their efforts
were mostly  in vain  Mr Sadikov  said only   people  from his
group of   made it  through including his wife  and militiaman
son  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died  including  his
yearold elder brother

I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat
he said pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes We
have never got any of the bodies back

The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire
One hero  of the  evacuation Alif  Hajief was  shot dead  as he
struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's
crossing Mr Sadikov said

Another hero  Elman Memmedov the  mayor of Hojali said  he and
several others  spent the whole day  of  February in  the bushy
hillside surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three
Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay

As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam  there was
little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was
soon to flee

The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian
rocket attack Some people just  kept going Mr Sadikov said I
had to  get to the  hospital for treatment I  was in a  bad way
They even found a bullet in my sock

Victims of  war An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son killed  in the
Hojali massacre in February  left Nurses struggle in primitive
conditions  centre  to  save  a  wounded  man  in  a  makeshift
operating  theatre set  up  in a  train carriage  Griefstricken
relatives in  the town of Agdam  right weep over the  coffin of
another of the massacre victims Calculating the final death toll
has been  complicated because Muslims  bury their dead  within 
hours

TIME December   'Letters'

who is attempting to make any discussion of the
massacres in Armenia of Turks so noiseladen as to make serious discussion
impossible thereby cloaking the historical record with a tremendous cloud
of confusion

You have set up straw horses and knocked them down I'm not impressed
Anyway the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces
massacred  million defenseless Turkish women children and elderly
people burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated
the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between
 Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today
in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide
that is hard to match A hundred years ago Armenians again thought
they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the
Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models Several Armenian
terror groups like ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle
resorted to the same tactics in the s butchering scores of innocent
Turks and their families in the United States and Europe It seems that
they are doing it again at a different scale in fascist xSoviet Armenia
today


Source Stanford J Shaw on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian
armies in  History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey Volume
II Reform Revolution  Republic The Rise of Modern Turkey 
London Cambridge University Press  pp 

In April  Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city
 of Van whose  Armenians comprised  percent of the population
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the EmpireLeaving Erivan
 on April   Armenian volunteers reached Van on May  and organized
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during
 the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the
 southern side of the lake

Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories Armenian political leaders army officers and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves

With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in  at the beginning of
 World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies

I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and
 Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia Although two months
 have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs I
 have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at
 almost every step All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from
 Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly
 slain are everywhere According to accounts by those who were able to
 save their lives by escaping to mountains the first horrible and fearful
 events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then
 taken over by Armenian gangs The Russians usually treated the people
 well but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians Once these
 places had been taken over by the Armenians however the massacres begun
 They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the
 Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus solve the nationality
 problem Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers
 who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and
 Alexander Paul GumruLeninakanRussian officers tried to save the
 Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs
 I am now in Erzurum and what I see is terrible Almost the whole city is
 destroyed The smell of the corpses still fills the air Although there are
 speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as
 well I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard but there is
 proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war

Never I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an
index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned
and advised by Toynbee If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude
of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians by massacring an alien
population under their rule which constituted about  of their total
population and they did it only within a time period of a little over
two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population

Now I would like to ask you

  Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to
  this one

And again I would like to ask you

  Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands
  of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a Final
  Solution to TurcoTartar problems in Armenia is similar or not
  to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to
  Jewish problems

Ok I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations However
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it

Sounds like wishful guessing


As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the socalled peace process they
are not against peace per se but rather for their wellfounded predictions
that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank and most probably the same
for Golan Heights back to the Arabs An  months of negotiations in Madrid
and Washington proved these predictions Now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for noresult negotiations
I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations what do they have to
loose 


'Socalled'  What do you mean  How would you see the peace process

So you say palestineans do not negociate because of 'wellfounded' predictions 
How do you know that they are 'well founded' if you do not test them at the
table   months did not prove anything but it's always the other side at
fault right 

Why  I do not know why but if let's say the Palestineans some of them want
ALL ISRAEL and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis

Or maybe they palestinenans are not yet ready for statehood 

Or maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership too many
fractions aso 

I am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one but any of
these could make arabs stall the negotiations

Arabs feel that the current negotiations is ONLY for legitimizing the current
statusquo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and
oranges That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked

I like California oranges And the feelings may get sharper at the table

  An Israeli soldier stabbed in the neck was lightly injured Soldiers

A soldier is attacked and his attacker is killed  What is the problem

soldiers who shot to injure rather than kill  Another lesson here

You are really sick my friend  The problem is that YOU PEOPLE do not have

If you don't see anything wrong with EIGHT soldiers walking up to a naked

couldn't help but do a followup

	A poster attempts to discuss an event rationally with no indication
at all that he is identified with any specific ethnic group  he is merely
talking in terms that might apply to ANY group in similar circumstances

	Schmidling comes back with a rabid attack against YOU PEOPLE as if

        Not really since i am a logical person who likes furthering himself
        from any name calling i started trashing any article that contains
        such abuses without responding to and sometimes not even reading articles
        written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company

    deleted stuff
    well  ok let's see what Master of Wisdom Mr Jonas Flygare
    wrote that can be wisdomely responded to 

 Are you calling names or giving me a title If the first read your
 paragraph above if not I accept the title in order to let you get into the
 um well debate again

I didnot know that Master of wisdom can be name clling too
unless you consider yourself deserveless 

    Master of Wisdom writes in Marfrejteknikumuuse

     hasan
      flax
       hasan

          In case you didNOT know Palestineans were there for  months
          and they are coming back
          when you agree to give Palestineans their HUMANRIGHTS

          Afterall human rights areNOT negotiable

       Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the right to one's life also
       a 'human right' Or does it only apply to palestinians

      No it is EVERYBODY's right However when a killer kills then he is giving
      up willingly or unwillingly  his life's right to the society
      the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by
      depriving the killer off his life's right

     So then it's all right for Israel to kill the people who kill Israelis
     The old 'eye for an eye' thinking Funny I thought modern legal systems
     were made to counter exactly that

    So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you Master of Wsidom
 							       
 
 If you insist on giving me namestitles I did not ask for you could at
 least spell them correctly sigh

That was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey 

    when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that
    the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE
    and hence ALL their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on
    the ground of occupied territories

 No I am not neglecting that I'm merely asking you whether the existance
 of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right
	        are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here
 to live a as you so eloquently put it human right We can get back to the
 question of which law should be used in the territories later Also you have
 not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights


First my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens
in the WB revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation
of the WB revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically
revokes the right of for its military men Clearly occupation is an
undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate

Secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to
protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing
Palestinean human rights


    What do you expect me to tell you Master of Wisdom when I did explain my
    point in the post that you responded to The point is that since Israel
    is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights
    to the Occupied Palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic
    deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society

 If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions then
 tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all


Because not all states are like Israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant


      What kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue
      The answer is to be found in a certain system such as International law
      US law Israeli law 
    deleted Jonas was throwing upnot for real so you can stick to the screen
      It seems that the US law represented by US State dept in this case
      is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories
      Anyway as for Hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system

     And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem

    The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem Why  because
    any system can solve it
    The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here all palestine

 I asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for
   
 all people involved I assumed that was obvious but I won't repeat that
 mistake Now that I have straightened that out I'm eagerly awaiting your
 reply

So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights
i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph

    Joseph Weitz administrator responsible for Jewish colonization
    said it best when writing in his diary in 
 	   Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
 	   peoples together in this country We shall not achieve our goal
 						                  
 	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country
 	   The only solution is a Palestine at least Western Palestine west of
 	   the Jordan river without Arabs And there is no other way than
 	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to
 	   transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be
 	   left Only after this transfer will the country be able to
 	   absorb the millions of our own brethren There is no other way out

 Just a question If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to
 getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
 charter that's the english translations if you have other information I'd
 be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to
 a private paper even older I'm not going to get into the question if he
 wrote the above but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
 their share of fanatics Guess what Those are not the people that will
 make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff

Exactly you are right I guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment
is full with  men like Joseph Weitz


    We and our either refers to Zionists or Jews i donot know which

    Well i can give you an answer you Master of Wisdom I will NOT suggest the
    imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem 

    I think that is fair enough 

 No that is not an answer since I asked for a system that could solve
 the problem You said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

Above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by  
any system can be used to solve the conflict  but not any system would
resolve it JUSTLY

 Guess where that takes your logic To nevernever land

You are proving yourself as a   First you understood what i meant but then
you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic Too bad for you
the Master of Wisdom


    The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children
 			   Rabbi Shoham

 Oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
 a real bummer when I try giving your posts any credit

Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in  if you were a
Zionists If you believe in Zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you
because the same Rabbi Shoham had said Yes Zionism is racism
If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes then drop Zionism
If you are not Zionist why are you bothered then You should join me in
condemning these racist Zionist codes and acts

Done But did it change the fact that during the period of  to 
the Armenian Government ordered incited assisted and participated
in the genocide of  million Muslim people because of race religion
and national origin By the way you still haven't corrected yourself
During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and
cringing and fawning over the Nazis In that zeal the Armenian publication
in Germany Hairenik carried statements as follows

Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements the Jews
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease and when it
 becomes necessary for a people the Nazis to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method these attempts are regarded as revolutionary During the surgical
 operation the flow of blood is a natural thing

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews 
extracts from a letter dated December   published in the San
Francisco Chronicle as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B Amarian

 We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people JewsMembers of our family witnessed the
  murder of  members of our family near Erzurum Turkey by Armenian
  neighbors bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish
  andor Muslim Armenians should look to their own history and see
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war on his premise
  to grant them self government if in return the Armenians would
  help exterminate JewsArmenians were also hearty proponents of
  the antiSemitic acts in league with the Russian Communists Mr Amarian

                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union All humanitarian constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter Universal Declaration of Human
Rights Helsinki Agreements Human Problems International Forums
documents signed by the Soviet Union  all of them are violated

The USSR's President government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace

The  strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan As a result a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed hundreds of people killed thousands wounded

Some  Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR their historical homeland
Together with them  Russians and  Kurds have also
been driven out a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan
Some  TurkishMeskhetians Lezghins and representatives
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance
for the honour and dignity of  million Azerbaijanis are
violated its territory culture  and history are trampled
its people are shot There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad and this defamation is spread over
the whole world by Soviet mass media Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR

We are for a united indivisible sovereign Azerbaijan we
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in  by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic
Republic  Muhammed Emin Rasulzade

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '
Year Reich'  the 'Great Armenia'  by annexing the
neighboring lands

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent

But what about the lives of seven million human beings
If these people are Muslims does it mean that they are
less valuable Can people be discriminated by their
colour of skin or religion by their residence or other
attributes

All people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion Our previous
appeals were unheard However we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins

                KARABAKH OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

   Everyone knows this even the Turks know this you know this Give
   us a time period when the world is currently boring and what is
   happening in Armenia would make front page headlines Think I'm lying
   Take a look at what happened in Somalia When did the press report
   it to the world

But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus
in the name of peace and democracy The Armenians are Christians the
Azerbaijanis are Moslems and Islam is a religion especially unloved
by the democratwesternizers Besides at the root of this conflict
lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan a consequence of which
were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people hundreds of
thousands of refugees and gross violations of human rights

Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred
thousands of Azeris The Parisbased 'Association for Democracy and
Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims
at  Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated This whole
thing has now gone entirely too far

   Want to know what will bring the story in Armenia to the front
   page If the Russians move into the area with a shit load of tanks
   THEN your human rights advocates will show up defending the Armenians
   Of course we can also be sure that the Russians won't show up with
   any tanks not with the problems they are having at home

They already did The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians
 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again  this
time in Azerbaijan There are remarkable similarities between the
plots the perpetrators and the underdogs

Report taken from The New York Times Tuesday March  

                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED

     AgdamAzerbaijanMarch  Reuters  Fresh evidence emerged today
of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in NagornoKarabakh
a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan
     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed
 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and
massacred men women and children fleeing the carnage across snowcovered
mountain passes
     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani
reports of a massacre

                         Scalping Reported
     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them
from retrieving more bodies
     Women and children have been scalped said Assad Faradshev an aide
to NagornoKarabakh's Azerbaijani Governor When we began to pick up bodies
they began firing at us
     The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam Rashid Mamedov said The bodies
are lying there like flocks of sheep Even the fascists did nothing like this

                         Truckloads of Bodies
     Near Agdam on the outskirts of NagornoKarabakh a Reuters photographer
Frederique Lengaigne said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani
bodies
     In the first one I counted  and it looked as though there were as
many in the second she said Some had their head cut off and many had
been burned They were all men and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms

This is very funny

israel Now how do you explain the attack on Syria in  Syria didnot
enter the war with israel till the th day 

By the way it is funny that you are implying that the reason behind 
by israel was only to capture Sinai egypt 


 to attack Israel which was a poor move seeing as how the Israelis
 promptly kicked his butt The territory is therefore forefeit  Retaining
 possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable but it beats
 national suicide for the Israelis Put another way one could ask why it
 is that so many Palestinians seem to think that TelAviv belongs to them
 and the future state of Palestine As long as this state of affairs
 continues it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they
 can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea Giving up the entire West
 Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint  In addition there is
 the small matter of Jerusalem which is considered to be part of the West
 Bank The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil Even
 leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude like Yossi Sarid aren't
 going to propose giving up Jerusalem If he did he'd get run out of town
 on a rail

Why don't you give it up Hasan  I'm really starting to get tired of your
empty lies  You can defend your position and ideology with documented facts
and arguments rather than the crap you regularly post  Take an example from
someone like Brendan McKay with whom I don't agree but who uses logic and
documentation to argue his position  Why must you insist on constantly spouting
baseless lies  You may piss some people off but that's about it  You won't
prove anything or add anything worthy to a discussion  Your arguments just
prove what a poor debater you are and how weak your case really is

   Hasan replies
   I didnot know that Master of wisdom can be name clling too
   unless you consider yourself deserveless 

Unless you are referring to someone else you have in fact given me a name
I did not ask for hence the term 'name calling'

   Hasan writes
       So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you Master of Wsidom
    							       
    
   I replied
    If you insist on giving me namestitles I did not ask for you could at
    least spell them correctly sigh

   Hasan gloats
   That was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey 

Hellbent on retarding into childhood no

   when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE
   and hence ALL their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on
   the ground of occupied territories
   
   No I am not neglecting that I'm merely asking you whether the existance
   of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals
   right
                are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here

No I really do try to spell correctly and I apologize if I did confuse you
I will try not to repeat that

    to live a as you so eloquently put it human right We can get back to the
    question of which law should be used in the territories later Also you have
    not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights


   First my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens
   in the WB revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation
   of the WB revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically
   revokes the right of for its military men Clearly occupation is an
   undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate

Ok let me rephrase the question I have repeatedly asked you if the
Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians and if so why
From your posting where you did not directly adress my question I inferred
that you thought so Together with the above statement I then assumed that the
reason was the actions of the state of Israel Re your statement of
occupation I'd like you to define the term so I don't have to repeat this
'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary

   Secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to
   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing
   Palestinean human rights

I'm sorry but the above sentence does not make sense Please rephrase it


    If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions then
    tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all


   Because not all states are like Israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant

Oh ok So how about the human rights of the Syrians Iraqis and others
Does the name of Hama sound familiar Or how about the kurds in Iraq and
Turkey
How about the Same in Sweden Ok maybe a bit farfetched the Russians in
the Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia
Do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you


        And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem
   
       The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem Why  because
       any system can solve it
       The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here all palestine
   
    I asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for
      
    all people involved I assumed that was obvious but I won't repeat that
    mistake Now that I have straightened that out I'm eagerly awaiting your
    reply

   So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights
   i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph

No I'm agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper
would probably lead to disaster for both parties If that's what you refer
to as the 'Israeli solution' then so be it

       Joseph Weitz administrator responsible for Jewish colonization
       said it best when writing in his diary in 
    	   Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
    	   peoples together in this country We shall not achieve our goal
    						                  
    	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country
    	   The only solution is a Palestine at least Western Palestine west of
    	   the Jordan river without Arabs And there is no other way than
    	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to
    	   transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be
    	   left Only after this transfer will the country be able to
    	   absorb the millions of our own brethren There is no other way out

 Just a question If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to
 getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
 charter that's the english translations if you have other information I'd
 be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to
 a private paper even older I'm not going to get into the question if he
 wrote the above but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
 their share of fanatics Guess what Those are not the people that will
 make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff

Exactly you are right I guess that the problem is that the israeli govermentis full with  men like Joseph Weitz

Oh Have you met with them personally to read their diaries Fascinating
What do you do for a living

    We and our either refers to Zionists or Jews i donot know which

    Well i can give you an answer you Master of Wisdom I will NOT suggest the
    imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem 

    I think that is fair enough 

 No that is not an answer since I asked for a system that could solve
 the problem You said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

   Above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by  
   any system can be used to solve the conflict  but not any system would
   resolve it JUSTLY

An unjust solution would be a nonsolution per definition no
You said the following

For all A it holds that A have property B
There exists an A such that property B does not hold

Thus either or both statements must be false

    Guess where that takes your logic To nevernever land

You are proving yourself as a   First you understood what i meant but then
you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic
Too bad for you the Master of Wisdom

I was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning
Since you claim to be logical I felt it best to point this out
before you started using your statements to prove a point or so
Am I then to assume you are  not logical

    The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children
 			   Rabbi Shoham

 Oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
 a real bummer when I try giving your posts any credit

Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in 
if you were a Zionists If you believe in Zionist codes and acts
well i feel sorry for you because the same Rabbi Shoham had said
Yes Zionism is racism
If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes then drop Zionism
If you are not Zionist why are you bothered then You should join me in
condemning these racist Zionist codes and acts

Any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all
individuals by a statement of an individual If you use the same
methods that you credit 'Zionists' with then where does that place you

Oh by the way I'd advice you not to assume anything about my 'loyalties'
I will and am condemning acts I find vile and inhuman but I'll try as
long as I can not to assume those acts are by a whole people
By zionist above do you mean the state of Israel the government of Israel
the leaders of Israel political andor religious or the jews in
general If you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible
instead How would you feel if we started condemning you personally
based on the bombings in Egypt

         The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians 
    To the children of genocide Send them away into the Desert

This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish
wartime WW governmental telegrams in translation entailing the orders
for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey Generally these
telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior Talaat Pasha
for example we have the following set regarding children

	To the Government of Aleppo

	 November   We are informed that the little ones belonging to
	 the Armenians from Sivas MamuretulAziz Diarbekir and Erzeroum
	 hundreds of km distance from Aleppo are adopted by certain Moslem
	 families and received as servants when they are left alone through
	 the death of their parents We inform you that you are to collect
	 all such children in your province and send them to the places of
	 deportation and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to
	 the people

				Minister of the Interior

						Talaat 

	To the Government of Aleppo

	 September   There is no need for an orphanage It is not the
	 time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans prolonging their
	 lives Send them away to the desert and inform us

				Minister of the Interior
						Talaat 

	To the General Committee for settling and deportees

	 November   There were more than four hundred children in the
	 orphanage They will be added to the caravans and sent to their
	 places of exile

	 				Abdullahad Nuri 


	To the Government of Aleppo

	 January   We hear that certain orphanages which have been
	 opened receive also the children of the Armenians Whether this is
	 done through the ignorance of our real purpose or through contempt
	 of it the Government will regard the feeding of such children or
	 any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it
	 purpose since it considers the survival of these children as
	 detrimental I recommend that such children shall not be received
	 into the orphanages and no attempts are to be made to establish
	 special orphanages for them

				Minister of the Interior

						Talaat 

	To the Government of Aleppo


	 Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures
	 to which their parents have been subjected Send the rest away with
	 the caravans

				Minister of the Interior

						Talaat 

	From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo

	 At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows
	 of Shekid fallen soldiers are in need of food and protection it is
	 not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by
	 Armenians who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble
	 in the future It is necessary that these children should be turned
	 out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of
	 deportation Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent
	 away in compliance with our previous orders to Sivas

				Minister of the Interior

						Talaat 

In  Halide Edip a pioneer Turkish nationalist wrote in her memoirs
about a conversation with Talaat Pasha verifying and rationalizing this
ultranational fascist antiArmenian mentality the following

	I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for
	 its own interest and succeeds the world admires it and thinks
	 it moral I am ready to die for what I have done and I know I
	 shall die for it 


These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the  trial of
Talaat Pasha's assassin Soghomon Tehlerian The Turkish government never
questioned these death march orders until  during a time when the world
was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians

For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial the
Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were
ever issued and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a
study by S Orel and S Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society

If one were to examine the sample authentic text provided in the Turkish
Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample it
too would be a forgery In fact if any of the tests delineated by the
Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or
PersianArabic script one finds that anything handwritten in such language is
a forgery

Today the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill Istanbul
Turkey just next to the Yildiz University campus The body of this genocide
architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW when Turkey was in a
heightened state of protofascism Recently this monument has served as a
focal point for antiArmenianism in Turkey

This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological
denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only
crime was to be born Armenian

DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN 


          Born 
          Attended th Grade
          Middle School No 

          Resident at Building  Apartment 
          Microdistrict No 
          Sumgait Azerbaijan

Really people in town didn't know what was happening on February  I came
home from school at  o'clock being excused to leave before the last period
in order to go to Baku When we left everything in town was fine Life was
the same as usual a few groups of people were discussing things soccer and
other things Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first
cousin's birthday my father my mother and I We spent the day in Baku and
on the th somewhere around  pm we got on the bus for home figuring
that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day

When we were entering town near the story highrises our bus was stopped
by a very large crowd The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus
The driver says that there are no Armenians on board then everyone on the bus
begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board The group comes up to
the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one not checking
passports just going by the way people look We get off the bus but are not
taken for Armenians

We set out in the direction of home At first we were going to go into an old
building where we knew there'd be a place to hide but the whole road was
packed with groups of people all the way from Block  to the th
Microdistrict These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking
passports People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well
Then we decided to go home instead Near the story highrises I saw burning
cars and a great many people standing around the driveways yelling Death to
the Armenians was written on the cars

When we came into the courtyardwe live in an Lshaped buildingit was still
quiet We went on upstairs but didn't turn on any lights We tried to call
Baku to warn our relatives who were due to arrive on Wednesday not to come
Then there was a knock at the door It was our neighbors who advised us to
come down to stay at their place We went down to their place and they led us
to the basement They live on the first floor and have a basement which you
enter across the balcony We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was
beatenshe ran away naked Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right
that's what the Armenians deserve because in Stepanakert allegedly people
were being killed  girls from Agdam had been raped We didn't stay very
long in the basement We tried to support one another as best we could
looking out the small window with the iron grating Papa watched and said
things now and then He said that there was a fire near Building  probably a
car on fire Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that
they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived The neighbors said that
there weren't any Armenians here and the group set out for the other wing of
the building They appeared from the  side of the building where I later
found out a woman had been murdered The woman who ran away naked died Yuri
Avakian was killed too

When the crowd left the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go
home We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light We
started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while We
tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait but there was no answer We
decided she had already left

We sat at home The phone rang and the caller asked to speak with my
father I called him to the phone It was Jeykhun Mamedov from my father's
work brigade He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our
town He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get
out of the city To be quite honest Papa didn't want to give him our address
but my mother got on the phone and told him Some  minutes after the
call a crowd ran into our entryway Bursting into the building they broke
down the door and came into the apartment   

They came straight to our apartment they knew exactly where the Armenians
were They came into our place We tried to resist but there was nothing we
could do One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them He
read the surname Danielian turned the page read Armenian and that alone
was enough to doom us He said that we should be moved quickly out into the
courtyard where they would have done with us Another standing next to him
pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has tolled They
had knives and steel truncheons

I had a knife in my hand Unfortunately I didn't use it I just knew that if
I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse They struck my parents
and said that I should put the knife on the piano Then one of them commanded
that we be taken outside One person was giving orders When we were taken
outdoors I went in the middle and my mother was behind me Someone started to
push her so she'd walk faster I let her go ahead of me and fell in behind
her When he tried to push me I hit him and at that moment they began
beating my parents I realized that resistance was completely useless

We are taken out into the courtyard and the neighbors are standing on their
balconies to see what will happen next The crowd surrounds us At first they
strike me and I'm knocked out when I come to they beat me again    I
lose consciousness often    I don't see or hear my parents since I was the
first one hit and was out cold When I come to I try to pick them up they are
lying next to me The crowd is gone the only people around are watching from
their balconies That's it I try to pick them up but can't My left arm is
broken I start toward the drive wanting to tell the neighbors to call an
ambulance The bodies of my parents are still warm

We were attacked at around  o'clock I regain consciousness at about  and
try to make it up the stairs home    When I knock at the neighbors' door
they push me back and tell me to go away I go up to the third floor our
neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance she
sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment I often look out the
window to see if the ambulance has arrived but I can't see very far as a
result of the blows and it seems that my parents have already been taken
away Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken
away and everything will be OK

But they were still there Later at  in the morning as I found out the
ambulance picked them up but they were already dead If they received
attention on time it is possible they would still be alive Later around 
o'clock on the th policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with
some assistants They call an ambulance and  minutes later it arrives
and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital There they stitch the wounds
on my head and rebind my arm At  o'clock I and the other Armenians who are
in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku

In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people all of them
Armenians The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians The only
Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events
before the th

Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku I was there  days When I was
released on the th day I found out that my parents were dead At first
they told me that they were in Moscow being treated but later I found out
that they were dead My father's older brother told me

My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian He was born in  My
mother born in  was Seda Osipovna Danielian Papa worked at PMK the
leader of the roofing brigade mamma was a compressor operator

They were also beaten on the head The coroner's report stated that their
heads were smashed open and bled profusely

At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov who had called As it turned out
later he had been the one who tipped the crowd off He had called
specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address
and dispatch the group He knew the phone number but didn't know the address
Before the events I had never seen him but had often spoken with him on the
phone when he would ask to speak with my father I knew him by name He
denies that I was the one who answered the phone saying that my father
answered it He denies that he called from a public phone saying that he
called from home which also isn't true I heard noise and the sounds of
automobiles As I later found out earlier he had been convicted but had
never served any timehe had received a suspended sentence He was about 
years old I don't know if he has since confessed or not I am sure that he
was the one who tipped the crowd off Onehundred percent sure

My parents were from Karabagh Father was from the village of Badar and was
two years old when his family moved to Baku where his elder brothers were to
go to school He was a student at the Naval School but never graduated He
went off to work on the virgin lands one of the gigantic agricultural
projects instituted under Khrushchev When he returned he lived in Baku and
later moved to Sumgait helping with the town's construction Mamma was from
the village of Dagdagan also from Karabagh She worked in Sumgait first in
a bookstore and later on a construction site


My sister is older than I She lives with her husband here in Karabagh I
always loved my parents That was why I went on to th grade because it
was their dream that I would continue my studies I finished th grade and
wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School and after that the Military
School But later I changed my mind or rather my parents got me to recon
sider saying that it would be better to finish the th grade and then join
the Naval School I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life
longsince childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor My father wanted it
more than anything He always recollected his youth telling of the School
and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it

Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here I will stay at the home
of my grandfather of my ancestors till the end of my days

While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had
suffered as well like Ishkhan Trdatov He managed to hold them off at
their residence in Microdistrict  Building  Apartment  for a long
time lost his father Gabriel and by some miracle managed to survive I
also learned of Uncle Sasha from Building  whose daughter was raped

   Besides them ValeryI forgot his last namewas in the hospital too
about a year younger than I he went to School No  He was riding with
his parents in the car People were throwing rocks at them he was hit and
his parents brought him to the hospital and he was in our ward We even
came to be friends Before that we had just seen each other around town But
in the hospital we got to know one another better I learned of the fates of
others those who had died or who were befallen by misfortune   

Today Suren Harutunian the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia
was shown on television To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to
recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic
I was repelled no revolted to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision
of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of
Armenia

After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku the best solution is to give
Karabagh to Armenia return it to Armenia since the people want to live
peacefully with the Azerbaijanis but everything has to be right before they
can do that

I arrived in Karabagh on April  I felt very bad I had constant headaches
After a while my strength returned My older sister Suzanna took me in I
think that justice should prevail the people are demanding their due

You can't take away what is their due My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno
Karabagh often visited herespent almost all of my vacations here We had
even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia we would move
here for sure We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much and
that what had been done in removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armeniawas
wrong Sooner or later mistakes should be corrected And in order to correct
a mistake it must not be repeated and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies
in the hands of our government


Sorry guys for this long article but in fact it is mostly quotings

In article FLAXAprfrejteknikumuuse flaxfrejteknikumuuse Jonas Flygare writes

    when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that
    the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE
    and hence ALL their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on
    the ground of occupied territories
    
    No I am not neglecting that I'm merely asking you whether the existance
    of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals
    right
     to live a as you so eloquently put it human right We can get back to the
     question of which law should be used in the territories later Also you have
     not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights


    First my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens
    in the WB revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation
    of the WB revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically
    revokes the right of for its military men Clearly occupation is an
    undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate

 Ok let me rephrase the question I have repeatedly asked you if the
 Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians

well if you just waited for  more lines you would have read my statement
Secondly surely israeli have human rights but 

 and if so why

because they belong to the human race or do you disagree on that too 

 From your posting where you did not directly adress my question I inferred
 that you thought so Together with the above statement I then assumed that the
 reason was the actions of the state of Israel Re your statement of
 occupation I'd like you to define the term so I don't have to repeat this
 'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary

    Secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to
    protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing
    Palestinean human rights

 I'm sorry but the above sentence does not make sense Please rephrase it

I donot know about you but it makes full sense to me
Israelis are being killed because Israel is occupying  Let israel withdraw
and israeli blood will be saved It isNOT the palestineans who undermined
the right of life of israelis but it is israel which occupied and exposed
the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of  

More generally the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada
and i had previously posted a long article about this issue whom i finished
by an open question
Suppose the Intifada stops What is the motive for Israel to withdraw 
donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit Everybody in the world looks
and hopes for peace so why isnot there any hope of peace is necessary
but not sufficient motive


     If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions then
     tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all


    Because not all states are like Israelas oppressiveas ignorantor as tyrant

 Oh ok So how about the human rights of the Syrians Iraqis and others
 Does the name of Hama sound familiar Or how about the kurds in Iraq and
 Turkey
 How about the Same in Sweden Ok maybe a bit farfetched the Russians in
 the Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia
 Do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you

As for the Arabian countries their problems are an Arabian concern
the Arabian people can deal with it themselves if the west doesnot intervene
As for Serbs I donot think that those FUCKED UP RAPISTS excuse my language
but it really hurts as much if I was in Bosnia itself areNOT humans Those
surely came from outer space or something No human can allow himself
to see such attrocities than to participate in

         And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem
    
        The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem Why  because
        any system can solve it
        The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here all palestine
    
     I asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for
       
     all people involved I assumed that was obvious but I won't repeat that
     mistake Now that I have straightened that out I'm eagerly awaiting your
     reply

    So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights
    i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph

 No I'm agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper
 would probably lead to disaster for both parties If that's what you refer
 to as the 'Israeli solution' then so be it

Ok

        Joseph Weitz administrator responsible for Jewish colonization
        said it best when writing in his diary in 
     	   Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
     	   peoples together in this country We shall not achieve our goal
     						                  
     	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country
     	   The only solution is a Palestine at least Western Palestine west of
     	   the Jordan river without Arabs And there is no other way than
     	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to
     	   transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be
     	   left Only after this transfer will the country be able to
     	   absorb the millions of our own brethren There is no other way out

  Just a question If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to
  getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
  charter that's the english translations if you have other information I'd
  be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to
  a private paper even older I'm not going to get into the question if he
  wrote the above but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
  their share of fanatics Guess what Those are not the people that will
  make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff

 Exactly you are right I guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment
 is full with  men like Joseph Weitz

 Oh Have you met with them personally to read their diaries Fascinating
 What do you do for a living

     We and our either refers to Zionists or Jews i donot know which
 
     Well i can give you an answer you Master of Wisdom I will NOT suggest the
     imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem 
 
     I think that is fair enough 
 
  No that is not an answer since I asked for a system that could solve
  the problem You said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

    Above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by  
    any system can be used to solve the conflict  but not any system would
    resolve it JUSTLY

 An unjust solution would be a nonsolution per definition no

My definition is the same as yours but one has to look into the world politics
In politics a solution doesNOT imply JUST solution

 You said the following

 For all A it holds that A have property B
 There exists an A such that property B does not hold

 Thus either or both statements must be false

     Guess where that takes your logic To nevernever land

 You are proving yourself as a   First you understood what i meant but then
 you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic
 Too bad for you the Master of Wisdom

 I was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning
 Since you claim to be logical I felt it best to point this out
 before you started using your statements to prove a point or so
 Am I then to assume you are  not logical

It seems that it was problem in the definition of solution
I think a solution must be just because otherwise it would never be lasting
However when politicians say a solution they donot mean a just solution but
just a solution

     The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children
  			   Rabbi Shoham
 
  Oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
  a real bummer when I try giving your posts any credit

 Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in 
 if you were a Zionists If you believe in Zionist codes and acts
 well i feel sorry for you because the same Rabbi Shoham had said
 Yes Zionism is racism
 If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes then drop Zionism
 If you are not Zionist why are you bothered then You should join me in
 condemning these racist Zionist codes and acts

 Any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all
 individuals by a statement of an individual If you use the same
 methods that you credit 'Zionists' with then where does that place you

 Oh by the way I'd advice you not to assume anything about my 'loyalties'
 I will and am condemning acts I find vile and inhuman but I'll try as
 long as I can not to assume those acts are by a whole people
 By zionist above do you mean the state of Israel the government of Israel
 the leaders of Israel political andor religious or the jews in
 general If you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible
 instead How would you feel if we started condemning you personally
 based on the bombings in Egypt

 Jonas Flygare

 	Is Chomsky thus equivacating the genocide in Cambodia with the invasion
 and occupation of E Timor

 I think the word you have in mind is equating  And no Noam Chomsky
 is considerably too intelligent to think that history ever repeats
 itself exactly  He has said however repeatedly that the two acts
 were of comparable brutality and should receive comparable
 condemnation  There's a good case to be made that he's right what's
 happened and is happening in East Timor is considerably worse than
 most Americans realize  This is in part because there are very few
 stories about East Timor in the mainstream press

	Ok as far as that goes I agree  The situatio in E Timor does deserve
the attention that Bosnia Angola etc get  ButI also think that the
press can't be forced to print articles air shows about it etc
	The religious right got tired of the mainstream media and started
buying their own stationspapers  The left should do the same thing instead of
relying on NPR and public stations

 	If so how does he explain away the difference between an intended
 goal of genocide Cambodia and a brutal occupation

 I don't think that anyone can ever say for sure what the intended
 goal of the Khmer Rouge was  What we can do though is look at
 their actionsand those actions have been quite horrible both those
 of the Khmer Rouge and of the Indonesian occupiers  I don't think
 that the word genocide is too strong to apply to either situation

	I wouldn't venture that far to say the situation in E Timor is
genocide  The Indonesians seem perfectly willing to not kill anyone who
doesn't get in their way which is something the Khmer Rouge didn't do
Virtually everyone not in the Khmer Rouge suffered the killing fields
	Once again not to downplay the violence in Timor

 	If so why isn't he in Australia chanting no blood for oil

 Probably because he thinks that this form of protest would be silly
 and ineffective  Or is that explanation too obvious

	I don't agree  Right now Australia is the most effective lever against
Indonesia  They are negotiating for oil drilling rights off Timor and
stopping that process would go a long way towards making Indonesia realize that
people don't want to see the situation swept under the rug

I dunno Warren  Just the other day I heard a rumor that Serdar Argic
aka Hasan Mutlu and Ahmed Cosar and ZUMABOT is not really a Turk at all
but in fact is an Armenian who is attempting to make any discussion of the
massacres in Armenia of Turks so noiseladen as to make serious discussion
impossible thereby cloaking the historical record with a tremendous cloud
of confusion

But what is Hasan B Multu's middle name  I'm not sure but I heard
it was Bibo  I also seem to recall that Argic is Azari for bites
the wax Macedonian

We don't have a mail address but how about finding a snail address
Then instead of quashing Shergold rumors we could just redirect them
 Ahmed Cosar is a seven year old Greek boy with an incurable case of
crossposting  His wish is to get into the Usenet Book of World
Records for having the highest noise to signal ratio

In article CxCupolarisasyncvtedu jfurrpolarisasyncvtedu Joel Furr writes

Do it  Depew has shown himself to be unrepentant though embarrassed and
still possessed of the same fuckedup hubrisladen selfrighteousness that

The theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminalNazi
Armenians of the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle
Now try dealing with the rest of what I wrote

What is more the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been
efforts aimed at eradicating a race the Turks or aimed at carrying out a
onesided feud instead of being a struggle for liberation From the outset
the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took
the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder cruelty
and genocide so that no other interpretation of them is possible Armenian
activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of
terror and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks The element
of brute force in these activities increased steadily culminating in mass
rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War Furthermore
when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the  Sarikamis
defeat Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area
Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy nevertheless they
were constrained by the rules of war However when they returned to their
country in  after the Revolution Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked
in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum
in  During this period Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on
the local people which is recorded in historical documents

For example let us look at a report dated  March  which the Commander
of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan

 They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down
  by Armenians even the trees were cut down and they are like a
  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word

As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan

Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning
 with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken
 in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated When the Russian army
 withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian
 massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked
 in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places
 selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs
 were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
 being subjected to every conceivable abominable act A very small part
 of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the
 cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering
 from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived
 in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to
 Including women and children such persons discovered so far do not
 exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in
 Erzurum All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled everything
 that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them
 in a destitute situation At the present time the people are subsisting
 on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from Russian storages
 left behind after their occupation of this area

Foreign observers who witnessed the events including Russian Officers
who did not desert their lines submitted detailed reports proving the
genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war
What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the
massacres did not happen by chance but were planned'

At the end of the war the German author Dr Weiss his Austrian colleague
Dr Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon Kars
Erzurum and Batum between April th and May th  to record the
cruelties Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities
but also reveal their goal and true nature

 forgotten concealed and wiped from memory  the fact of ArmenianNazi
 collaboration

 A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der DeutschArmenischen Gesselschaft
 is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration The
 magazine was first published in Berlin in  during Nazi rule of Germany
 and continued publication until the end of  Even the name of the
 magazine which implies a declaration of ArmenianNazi cooperation
 is attentiongetting

 This magazine every issue of which proves the collaboration is historically
 important as documentary evidence It is a heap of writing that should be
 an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind

 In Nazi Germany Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain
 political economic and social rights were thus granted to them They
 occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices
 The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered
 Aryan and what befell them

	BELGRADE Yugoslavia UPI  Greek Prime Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis visited the capital of the SerbiaMontenegro federation
Tuesday in an apparent attempt to press Serbian leaders into accepting
the international plan to end the war in BosniaHerzegovina

So far so good

	I came here as an old friend of this countryto help in solving
the burning problem of BosniaHerzegovina'' Mitsotakis told reporters
after talking for two hours with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia

Old friend whatever

	I did not come here to discuss any particular plan I came to hear
the Serbian point of view'' he said adding that Serbia is sincerely
trying to bring peace to the region''

That is a great attitude for someone who wants to pressure the Serbs to
accept a peace plan that gives them most of the territory they got by
force and terror

	Milosevic said that Serbia and Greece had practically identical
views'' on the Bosnian war which started late in March  when the

this is a good thing to hear Anybody wondering why Serbia is not
really under any boycott Anybody remembers the Gulf war Did Saddam
kill  people and rape  women

	In an effort to pressure Milosevic who is considered to be the main
patron of Serbian territorial conquest in Bosnia the UN Security
Council has threatened to impose new sanctions against Serbia and
Montenegro and implement a nofly zone over Bosnian skies

Still in the threatening stage Maybe when there is no more Bosnians
the UN will lift the arms Embargo on them Military intervention that
is reserved for Muslim countries

NOW HEAR THIS
	After meeting Milosevic Mitsotakis had separate talks with Radovan
Karadzic the leader of Bosnian Serbs
	I encouraged Mr Karadzic to proceed with his efforts to achieve a
just peace in the region'' he said
	We are ready to play a positive role in the Balkans'' said
Mitsotakis

real positive I might add in favor of his old freinds of course

	Karadzic said that he was honored'' to meet the Greek premier
	Greeks are not one sided and they do not tend to condemn only one

You bet they are not

side in this war'' said Karadzic
	We will continue to negotiate on all levels'' he said
	Before meeting with Milosevic Mitsotakis had talks with President
Dobrica Cosic of the federal Yugoslav union of Serbia and Montenegro
and Patriarch Pavle the head priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church

Well Panos Mr Tamamidis the way you put it it is only the Turks
who bear the responsibility of the things happening today That is hard to
believe for somebody trying to be objective
When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides
What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW anyway
Do you think it was your right to be there
I am not saying that conflicts started with that It is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
It is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey I thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better

The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
people They have never met me but they know I am bad person
because I am from Turkey Politics is not my business and it is
not the business of most of the Turks When it comes to individuals
why the hatred So that makes me think that there is some kind of
brainwashing going on in Greece After all why would an educated person
treat every person from a nation the same way can you tell me about your
history books and things you learn about GreekTurkish
encounters during your schooling
take it easy

On the th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show
at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee about  yards
away The SK theater They were showing an Argentinian film The Abyss
Before the film we noticed about  to  people standing near the podium at
the City Party Committee but they were silent there's no conversation
whatsoever and we couldn't figure out what was going on That is we knew it
was about Karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if
someone gave a speech or not we didn't know We bought our tickets There
were  or  people in the theater This was a very small number for that
large movie theater The film started About  minutes later they stopped the
film A crowd burst in About  people They came up onto the stage Well
mostly they were young people from  to  years old They demanded that an
Armenian woman come up onto the stage They used foul language and said that
they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do
to Armenian girls I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded
a girl specifically Marina and I were sitting together I told her to move
over there were some Russian girls sitting nearby So that if someone
recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not Marina
It got quiet  or  girls jumped up to run out but the door was closedit's
only opened at the end of the   showand they returned to their seats
Everyone in the theater was looking at one another Russians Azerbaijanis
people of various nationalities But no one reacted at all no one in the
auditorium made a sound They were silent looking at one another and
gradually started to leave Some guy a really fat one says OK we've
scared them enough let's leave They leave slowly pompously It seemed to
me that those people were not themselves Either they had smoked a bunch of
anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like
they were ready to tear anyone apart Then it was all over as though nothing
had happened at all The film started up again it was one of those cheerful
films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive We
could barely sit to the end So it had started at seven it was over by nine
and it was dark   

Marina and I were walking home Lenin Street that's the center of town Lenin
Street was packed just packed with young people They were shouting
something about Karabagh and something about Armenians We weren't especially
listening because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to
make it home or not and just what had happened anyway Public transportation
wasn't running Incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police
policemen standing there The director of the movie theater was looking at the
doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors
there are basically all glass Everything was broken He stood there grief
stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some
naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot Well
since he looked more or less calm I decided that nothing all that super
serious had happened We went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we
live literally one stop away We didn't want to go on foot not because it was
dark but because something might happen We flagged down a cab but the
driver didn't want to take us We told him we live near the bus station and
he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther I said well
OK   

So we got into the cab and managed to get there Something incredible was
happening at the bus station There was a traffic jam Public transportation
was at a standstill and everyone was shouting Karabagh they're not going
to give up Karabagh I go home and tell my family what's going on and there's
immediate panic in the house Mamma says what should we do Like the end had
come they were going to come kill us that's it    Somehow we managed to
cheer ourselves up Nothing that bad could happen Where are we living anyway
just what kind of social order do we have Somehow we manage to calm Mamma
down And we went to bed But no one could sleep Everyone made as though
nothing had happened

That was on Saturday In short the day went by We didn't go anywhere and
didn't call our relatives No one did anything Because    life goes on
That day I realized something was approaching but what exactly I couldn't
guess

On the th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always
had There were five of us at home Mamma Papa and us three sisters Lyuda
Marina and I My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time We sat at home and
no one went out Later we learned that a demonstration had started that
morning It all started    They were smashing up stores We were sitting at
home and didn't know anything about it Then a girlfriend of mine Lyuda
Zimogliad came by at around three o'clock I think We worked together we did
our apprenticeships together she's a Russian girl She said that something
awful was happening in town I asked Don't they want Armenians Well what
are they after if they're already in that state She says no nothing like
that it's just a demonstration but it's awful to watch it Somehow it feels
like a war has broken out Public transportation has been stopped    The
cabs the buses well it's just a nightmare

Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy
problems at the time    He left the house and our neighbor Aunt Vera
asked him Where are you going Stop There are such terrible things going
on in the courtyard aren't you afraid to go out Papa didn't know what she
was talking about She simply pushed him back into the entryway He came home
and told Mamma Mamma said Well if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means
that something is really going on But we didn't go see her she's a Russian
she lives across from us I had to see my friend out Around five o'clock I
tell Lyuda Ok look it's time for you to go it's late already I'll see
you out Mamma says You don't need to go it's too late already you can
see what the situation in town is So we decided to stay home Dinner was
ready Mamma says Let her eat with us then she can go We sat down at the
table But no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything
out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we're eating
We turned on the television and the show In FairyTale Land was coming on
We cleared the table

We hear some noise out in the courtyard I go out on the balcony but I can't
see what's going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus
station and there is a story building in the way There is mob of people
   I can't figure out what's happening They're shouting something looking
somewhere I can't make out what is going on I go down to a neighbor she's
an Azerbaijani we've been friends of her family for about  years I go down
to look from their place I see people shouting looking at the and story
buildings near the bus station Just then soldiers set upon them about 
people with clubs The mob runs off in different directions I even see
several people from our building They are looking and laughing    I decide
that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing it means they're not
killing anyone But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers One of
the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their
feet everyone's kicking him    I become ill and go home and explain in
general terms that horrible things are going on out there     can't speak
   Well they've probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is   
If each of them kicked him just once    They took his club away from him
and started to beat him with it But it was far away and I couldn't see if he
got up and left or not

I become terrified and go home and say Lyuda don't go anywhere stay at our
place because if you go out they could kill you or     Then the crowd
runs over closer toward our building and stands at the story building and
starts shouting something We go out onto the balcony All of our neighbors
are also out on theirs too Everyone is standing staring The mob is
shouting and about  minutes later comes running toward our building As it
turns out at the story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and
kept them from coming in There's only one entryway there they could stop
them

They all run up to our building Mamma immediately starts closing the windows
afraid that they might throw stones They have stones and they break the
windows all of them There are very many people We have a large courtyard
and it's packed with people They spill up to the first floor so they don't
crush each other They crawl up on trees posts and garages It's just a huge
cloud of people They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey
Sargisian from our building We close the windows and immediately hear
tramping in our entryway They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous
din and roar It's incomprehensible Mamma told me later that they were
shouting Father's name Grisha open the door we've come to kill you or
something like that I don't remember that I was spaced out kind of Mamma
says Into the bedroom quickly In the bedroom we have two tall beds part
of our dowry Mamma says Hide there they probably won't come in there
they'll ask something say something and leave She says We'll tell them
that we live alone here I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in
the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts    I go to them and say
that I'll stand together with them I'll talk with them if they come maybe I
can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me I speak
Azerbaijani more or less and I can find out what they want I told Marina and
Lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister Lyuda I can't remember if I told
her anything or not

Then    they open the door it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell
right into the hall The crows bursts in and starts to shout Get out of here
leave vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia things like that I
tell them What has happened speak calmly One of you tell me calmly what
has happened In Azerbaijani they say Get out of the apartment leave I
say OK Go downstairs We'll gather everything we need and leave the
apartment I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with
them these are animals They must be stopped The ones standing in the
doorway the young guys say There are old people and one girl with them
Too bad They take two or three steps back It seems as though I have
pacified them with our exchange Then someone in the courtyard shouts
commanding them Don't you understand what you are saying Kill them

And that was it That was all it took They grab Papa carry him into one
room and Mamma and me into another They put Mamma on the bed and start
undressing her beating her legs They start tearing my clothes right there
in front of Mamma I don't remember where they went what they did or how
much time passed I had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body
and tore my clothes all at the same time I don't even know what I said The
atrocities started I was savagely raped in that room They argued among
themselves who would go first

Later I remember I came to I don't know if I'm dead or alive Someone comes
in someone tall I think cleanshaven in an Eskimo dogskin coat balding
He looks around at what's happening At that instant everything stops It
seems to me that he is either their commander or    that somehow everything
depends on him He looks and says Well we're done here They are beating
Mamma on the head They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs
   She loses consciousness and they decide that she's dead Papa    was
out cold They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony but they can't get the
window open Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the
windows can't be opened They leave her next to the window She was thinking
about being thrown out the window and passed out She's not a real strong
person anyway    He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something that
I'm still twitching Well I start saying the opposite of what I should be
which is humbling myself and pleading I start shouting cursing    they
don't get any entreaty out of me I  already know that I'm dead why would I
humble myself before anyone And he says that if that's what I think since my
tongue is so long    maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing
   In short he commands that I be taken outside

I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda I don't
know if they are alive or not They take me outside They are dragging me by
my arms by my legs They are hitting me against the wall the railings
something metal    While they are carrying me someone is biting me someone
else is pinching me   I don't even know I think my God when will death
come If only it were sooner    Then    they carry me out throw me near
the entryway    and start kicking me I lose consciousness    What
happened after that how many people there were I don't remember

I come to after a while I don't remember how long A neighbor is bringing me
clothing I'm entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me I remember
that I said the same words over and over again Mamma what happened Mamma
what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at I can't make
sense out of anything There is a guy standing over me I sort of know him he
served in Afghanistan his name is Igor he brought me indoors When they all
went to the third entryway and killed a person there Igor gathered his
courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors' even though
he's smallminded he put himself at risk Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani he
served in Afghanistan There are three brothers The older brother also served
there I think now he's stationed here on the border in Armenia Igor
brought me to the neighbors' and then helped me come to my senses saying
Karina I know you calm down I'm not one of them How do I know who's who
and what's what I come to and they clean me up I was covered in blood Then
Papa    I saw Papa I saw Mamma And Marina too    Igor was there when
they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed    Marina    Lyuda
said that she was Russian they said we'll let you go we aren't touching the
Russians go And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going
to tell them she's Azerbaijani Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's
hands because he knows Marina and knows that she is Armenian and is our
sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding
on the door so she will open up She opens the door and Igor pushes them in
there So they survived

My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things
While they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back
up again Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed
there Then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put
it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor the
one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and
knocked on the door The neighbor opened and said I'm not going to let you
in the apartment because I'm afraid of them But I'll give you some stockings
and we'll leave the building Lyuda says I'll stay at your place because of
what's going on they keep going up and down the stairs It was just for a
moment just a moment in life but the neighbor wouldn't consent Lyuda came
back to our place and lay under the bed   

I came to Mother was there I can't remember my supervisor's telephone
number but something had to be done Somehow I remembered and called and he
came to get us He didn't have any idea what was going on He thought we were
simply afraid he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed
between life and death He came and got us and took us to the police precinct
There they looked us over I was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly
it was hard to breathe   

My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov He's the head of our
administration They took us there When we were leaving I saw a great number
of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town The buses were ordinary
passenger buses There were very many soldiers We left around eleven right
after eleven If these people could stop what was happening they could save a
great many lives    Because the crowd was moving on toward the school and
what was going on there    I think everyone know not only in Sumgait not
only in Yerevan Because there they murdered them all one after the next
without stopping After us

I think  people died in Microdistrict No  and  to  of them were from
Buildings   and  In our building one person died and one old woman died
from Building  that's the building in front of ours There young
Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building
Incidentally when we were at the neighbors' Marina called our relatives
to warn them so they would all know what was happening I called a aunt in
Microdistrict No  They have three neighbors who are Armenians I said Run
quickly I can't explain what's going on hide do what you can just stay
alive Hide at Azerbaijanis' ones who won't give you away At that moment
three people came in policemen I think they were Azerbaijanis I was in such
awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up
there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought I would ever see anything
out of that eye again    my forehead was badly cut and onehalf of my face
was pushed out forward No one would have thought that I would survive get my
normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all I started to
scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you
here haven't you killed people people yet what are you doing here One of
the soldiers said Don't scream at us We're Muslims but we're not from the
Sumgait police They called in from Daghestan So at that point the
Daghestan police were there

When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there
there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen    I don't know
maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously
injured to treat them there in the police precinct I don't know what they
were there for There were also doctors from Baku there They examined Lyuda
and me and said These women need to go to the Maternity Home but we don't
know what to do with the rest

So they took us and I lost contact with my parents my boss everyone My
boss said Don't worry I'll find you no matter where you are no matter
what happens We went to the hospital There we were examined by a department
head from the Sumgait Maternity Home Pashayeva I think her name was She
examined us The ambulance was from Baku I figured out that the Sumgait
ambulances hadn't done anything they didn't respond to any calls People
called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life

That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something
very good had happened for she became quite glad I even thought to myself
God can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong She looks me over and
says Now why are you suffering so You don't know what your people have been
doing your people did even worse things And I think great I have to deal
with her    And I felt so bad I thought why don't I just die so as not to
have to hear more stuff like this from people like her Here I am in this
condition and being told about something that our people did I just didn't
have the energy to say How could our people possibly be smart enough to
think of something that yours haven't already done I stayed there Then they
brought in another woman Ira B she was married and she was raped in her
own apartment too There were three of us Ira Lyuda and  The next
morning they took Lyuda and Ira away They didn't do anything to help us This
was in the old Maternity Home in the combined block They didn't do anything
more than examine me that was it I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer
nothing What shots could have calmed me down I didn't even want to look at
them

I lay in the ward Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur
pose but I was alone I was alone even though the wards were packed That
same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face
was disfigured She asked what had happened to me and I said Better to ask
your brother what happened there's no point in asking me your brother can
better explain what happened She fell into a faint All the doctors threw
themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my
ward

Then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me
clothing because I was literally naked The only thing I had on was a dress
but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up
above my knees and the woman orderly said I can't believe you put on such a
short dress who are you showing off your legs to here I went back to my
ward thinking just one more thing from something People from work came and
brought me something in a sack apples I think three or four pounds but I
couldn't take them I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing I said
that I couldn't take the apples and really didn't have any appetite No one
had to bring me anything Some woman took the sack    And oh yes   
Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should
be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an
Armenian maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me So they must
have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something
else would happen That it would be worse Or perhaps someone was outside on
the street I don't know In any case I didn't sleep a wink that night

The next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus
and off we went I didn't even know where they were taking me They took me to
the club where the troops were the very one I was in that illfated evening
I got off the bus Near the City Party Committee there were a great many
troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible I saw
a few people I knew there and that calmed me a little I had already thought
that I was the only one left So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait
after that night I still didn't know what happened to my parents they didn't
come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine
I didn't know whether to believe him or not Maybe he was just trying to calm
me down maybe something happened on the way Then I went to the club and saw
a lot of people I knew They all knew one another they were all kissing each
other and asking What happened what went on Two days later they came to
see me from work They were there all the time Each day they came showed
interest and were constantly bringing me money They did everything they
could Of course I'm most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues
who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions
neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what
happened He constantly took an interest A sincere interest from the heart
   Then about two days later the secretary of the Party Committee came
not from our Party organization but from the First Trust which ours is part
of Comrade Kerimov a very important figure in our town He made arrangements
with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if I sat down by
myself I couldn't get up or lie down again There was something wrong with my
lungs it was hard to breathe They examined me there several times there I
lay were several doctors they all thought that    that it must just be
from all the blows I don't know They didn't diagnose anything in particular
When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked    I made it a point of
insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful
There was no way something inside wasn't broken my ribs    Well they took
me there and took xrays and said that everything was fine There were
emergency medical workers on duty in the club The mother of one of Marina's
friends was there She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic
They had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what I
needed at that moment I thought I said that I was having great difficulty
breathing I couldn't seem to get enough air something was wrong with me
They put tight bandages around my chest and waist Later I overheard some
people saying that I had been cut all over I think they just saw me being all
bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut    But I
wasn't cut

They took us to the Khimik boarding house We lived there a long time Soon
appeared representatives    They were agitating At first people would not
talk to them and drove them off One of the Armenian women shouted We
demand that Seidov come The response was It's Seidov who sent us Seidov
is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers The woman said
We'll only see Seidov's daughter have her come here we'll do the same
things to her that they did to our daughters and then we'll deal with you
agitators And so on More of them said Have Seidov himself come This
went on day in day out The agitators kept coming and coming this drove us
out of our wits Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because
they realized it was senseless to stay Everything got on our nerves The
smell the small children There were children at the SK club children who
had literally just come out of the Maternity Home What were they doing in a
club that didn't even have running water all the time At first we had to pay
to eat there They even overcharged us as it turned out On the second day
someone told us that they would bring us food for free The children were ill
Everything stank there Well imagine about  people in a small movie
theater with seating for no more than  You couldn't sit or lie down it
was impossible to even move The stench was awful Even the smallest infants
took ill overnight there I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in
Yerevan the infants They have to be washed they have to be bathed not to
mention that we the adults were ill and needed care People were fainting
right and left I just don't know everyone was crying everyone    Only
the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together But the women
were in a constant state of panic It seemed to everyone that they would come
any minute and kill and stab It seemed clear that we had been gathered
together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie
theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left Then people went up to
the attic I didn't see them I only heard them because I was lying down and
couldn't get up I lay right on the stage we had some room there Apparently
they caught two people with either oil or gas I think they wanted to burn the
theater Maybe someone saw them I didn't I was in no condition to open my
eyes

Everyone was suspicious of everyone else They would ask Aren't you an
Azerbaijani I think I saw you somewhere I think you're an Azerbaijani They
led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their
passports relatives might be covering for each other Half of the people did
not have any documents There were people who had run out of their homes in
nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like
they should have with their IDs

So on the th on Sunday I think the police did nothing to help us On
Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block A They didn't
spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody They killed
they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible They murdered
the Melkumian family whom I knew my mother worked with them Their daughter
inlaw went to school with my older sister They were brutally murdered Only
the two daughtersinlaw survived By a miracle one was able to save herself
she ran away the neighbors wouldn't take her in so she ran about the
building until she found refuge She was pregnant and had two small children
This all continued on Monday in Block A on the th when the troops were
already in the city

They murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire
families They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians
or not I heard that the Lezgins suffered too I'm not sure myself I didn't
see any Lezgins who had been injured They burned cars so it's very difficult
now to say exactly who died and who didn't It was very difficult to identify
the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in
gasoline and burned    it's all very hard to imagine of course I heard
that many people disappeared without a trace from the BTZ plant two people
including a woman who worked the night shift Aunt Razmella who also lived in
Microdistrict 

They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait In the evening people who
had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait and people from Baku were
going home from Sumgait and there were students too They were simply
savagely murdered They were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did
what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that
hoard of brutally minded people They stopped the buses dragged the Armenians
out and killed them on the spot I didn't see it myself but I heard that they
put them all in a pile so as to burn them Later it was hard to discern from
the corpses well you can't call them corpses you had to figure out from the
ashes who it was l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student Ira
G if I'm not mistaken She was in the hospital a long time after that and
she still can't figure out who saved her She was also brutally raped and
beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses The fellow pulled her out of that
whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and
carried her to the city I still can't imagine how he managed to do that

I heard that from Engels Grigorian He knows her apparently Well a lot of
people went to that hospital anyway She was in the hospital and singing a
song in Armenian and they wrote the words down and I think he still has
that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song
the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape They
couldn't find the guy who saved her He left her in someone's apartment and
called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me
she couldn't remember anyone's face

I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe I had
talked with him once But I received so many blows everything was just knocked
out of my head I can't remember to this day who he was Then it seems I saw
the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization where Marina works She
goes to school and works she goes to night school at AZI and works by day at
the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration I'm the
Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met
with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations We had joint
meetings I know them all I've even talked with them and he I know is from
Armenia An Azerbaijani but from Armenia It became obvious that many of
those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia

They took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the
Procuracy because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case and I iden
tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize They
showed me the people who were in our apartment they're working on our
case but I can't even recognize them although it was proved that they were
the ones they're processing it somehow They tell me that they know that
someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were
dragging me There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch
me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that All these
people all of them as much as I've heard about them and seen them they were
all from Kafan

The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf Najaf Rzayev He was
there when everything started It must have been him because I didn't
recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him All the more since
I told him Listen you do something because you know me He turned away
and went toward the bedroom where Marina was Well you couldn't see Marina
anyway There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out
anyone All of it flew right out of my head and then gradually I became
myself again at the City Party Committee    There were military people
there I told them what went on and they wrote it all down I told them his
name On March  the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization the one
we're part of came to see us his name is Najaf Rzayev I tell Mamma If
he's here despite the fact that I gave his name it means that either his
alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think I'm crazy not
responsible for my words He said What did they do to you how awful
myself I hid an Armenian family Then after some time goes by he comes back
again and says something entirely different I wasn't at home my family and
I went to Baku I said Marina what is he saying He said something totally
different before After that I didn't go to see our Procurator our case is
being handled by a procurator from Voronezh Fedorov by name Fedorov told me
that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved
What are they doing with Rzayev
Did he prove his alibi or not They just think that since I was hit in the
head I can't say anything for sure whether it was him or not It will be an
insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it but at the
same time

I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he Because no mat
ter who I name they tell me no you're wrong he didn't do that that one
wasn't there All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind Who did what
exactly I can't say

When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but I didn't see it
because I had my eyes closed all the time It seemed to me that I always got
it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it
always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible When they were beating my
face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out So I had my eyes closed
they took me outside and started to beat me A young guy  held my arms he
works at the BTZ plant And right nearby across the road from us Block 
is where all this was going on Right across the road from us The BTZ
dormitory is over there that's where he lives Now he's in custody they even
have proved as far as I know that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian the
clarinet player from the third entryway of our building One person in our
building was killed it was that man

A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me He saw that
he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he didn't come
over he just looked and then went into the dormitory A while after it was
all over people started making announcements in town saying that
investigators had been summoned That guy went and told them everything Now
they've caught him everything's been proved Now evidently they've been
beating him I don't know what they're doing with them over there but he
himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant Some young guy
came to the plant and said Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the
bus station on Saturday at ten That was it He said the ones who wanted to
went This was at the BTZ plant during the night shift probably late Friday
night It was at night they were at the sauna together And he said what do
you mean do you understand what you are saying The others were silent
probably in their hearts they were thinking I'm going to go But they didn't
say anything to one another He said that he thought it important to to go
because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan that they had
killed their Azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of
that That guy was also born in Kafan That is certain And Marina says that
the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia too                                                             from

I've participated in the investigation a couple of times I'm satisfied with
them thus far They summoned us and asked about what happened and every word
I said was recorded I met some guy there    By the way he was an
Armenian I said that he was in our apartment but what he did I don't know
His last name was Grigorian Eduard Grigorian He s from Sumgait from
Microdistrict  He was sentenced I think to five years not his first time
His mother is Russian I met with him at the KGB in Baku at the Azerbaijani
KGB They took us there and showed me photographs There were so many
photographs I think they even photographed those people who were caught at
curfew and I've got them all confused I say the face was about like this
the guy in the white coat with the red clasps But he could take that coat off
and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a
haystack Well This guy Grigorian I said he was in our apartment but he
is so lightcomplected that he looks like a Lezgin I don't know what he did
I can't remember Maybe he beat me or raped me But he was in our apartment
At the KGB he started asking me pleading with me there's no need for this
all this stuff look me in the eyes you're like a sister to me I took a look
at him and thought My God Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like
you But they were satisfied with my responses because I said everything
without great certainty I was there with Mamma Then Lyuda came in but when
she came in she got sick immediately She wanted to kill him she crawled over
the table at him She recognized him When she came to Lyuda was lying on the
balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom We had
all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters
They stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things At that
moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything Well seeing the
faces hearing the voices    Two people were saying they could burn the
apartment Another says why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and
no place to live So this guy was in temporary housing he didn't have
anywhere to live he was from Sumgait They were sure that they would get the
apartment Besides the neighbors were Azerbaijani Why should they burn the
apartment they might burn Azerbaijanis That's what they said How did they
know there were Azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that
Armenians lived there We have a list of the residents for our part of the
building our name is in there but how could they know that Azerbaijanis
lived on the other side of the wall from us So they didn't set fire to our
apartment

I don't know I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt
when I was outside if someone had asked me what was happening I would
have said that a civil war was going on Well maybe not civil    but
probably civil because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw
that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at
a free horror film So a civil war was going on and only the Armenians were
being fought If it were a world war or something like that they would have
been fighting everyone But they only fought us Then I met some women from
our building some Azerbaijanis They are crying they tell me Karina we
saw all of it how could it happen They're asking me Well I just don't know
what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to
me I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been
able to take it or I would have tried to avert it like that one Azerbaijani
woman did in front of our building A woman lives there an awful dissipated
woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads Two
Armenian families live there in her part of the building She came out on the
balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse She
came down to the entryway and said You'll come in this entryway over my dead
body So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway Some
folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't
even know what they were doing I don't think that's true They knew very well
what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman They
couldn't have cared less about her but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani
stopped them

They were just beasts they had smoked so much When they came to our place
they were all chewing something I noticed Everyone who came into the
apartment was chewing something I think my God maybe I just think that
Maybe I'm losing my mind But no they're all chewing something Maybe it is
some kind of drug it must be because    At first glance they all seemed
to be such normal people young cleanshaven looking exactly as if they had
come to some sort of celebration But they were shouting something They
didn't talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there They
screamed and screamed Yeah killing killing we're killing the Armenians
Only they didn't shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary Gurun
literally means kill or destroy

That's how it was I'll continue We hid in a captain's apartment he's an
Azerbaijani his wife is a Tatar We were sitting in their apartment their
kids were out in the yard Their kids knew a whole lot This was in our part
of the building on the third floor When Mamma came to and couldn't find
Lyuda she took Papa's hand this was while the looters were stealing things
but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things Apparently
they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing Mamma found the
courage to   

A boy said to my mother Where's the gold Mamma said he must have been 
to  years old He even looked Russian he was so fairskinned But the
Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fairskinned I noticed they were all on the
fair side He shouted they were all smashing things and he asks Mamma where
the gold is We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers In a
little black bag we kept everything in there Mamma doesn't really like to
wear gold She probably never even wore those things from the time they were
bought for her They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass Mamma
thinks that the gold saved us Because they threw themselves at the gold and
Mamma grabbed Papa who was trying to breathe They had closed his mouth
bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face    They had
shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate Mamma grabbed him and
tore all that stuff off    He had something in his mouth he was having
trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood Mamma grabbed him and
started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted
to open their doors to them Mamma said that by accident completely by
accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said halfawake
What's happened He sees that they are bloody Mamma said At least go and
find out what's happening to my daughters even if they've burned them or
murdered them at least bring the corpses He went looking for us At that
moment Lyuda was under the bed She says that after they left it seemed that
someone was calling her name When he quietly called her she couldn't get out
from under the bed She wanted to get out and was calling softly She thought
she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to
herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting When she got out from
under the bed everyone was gone And again    She thought that she had lost
her mind I'll never leave here never To hell with it It just seems that
way to me I'll come to eventually But then when everything had settled
down stopped that mall brought Lyuda down and Igor carried me in from
outside Or first I was brought in then Lyuda I don't remember what order it
happened in

And Mamma said Listen they're all running around down there shouting
something or other and running toward the other building It had more or
less calmed down where we were Who's dead who's alive we don't know I
tried to call my girlfriend I had basically come to Mamma says Listen
let's go upstairs at least get a mattress or something We don't know how
long we'll be here Maybe they didn't burn everything I don't get it all
women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe
not everything was taken I tell Mamma Mamma what do you need any of that
for To hell with it We're alive forget the rest of it all of it She
says No let's go get at least something Maybe we'll leave here spend the
night at someone else's Mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son
Alik was standing on the lookout lIe was standing there to see if they were
coming They only managed to run up there and grab something one time He
shouts Come back they're coming They didn't have enough time to get a
lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another    Mamma got my
knitting    Someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore
out of the hall    Someone took Father's old coveralls The neighbor his
wife Mamma and Papa    Marina went with them I was in no condition to
leave Neither was Lyuda We just sat They ran out and we closed the door and
just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs
they're dragging something again They were going toward the other building
maybe over by the school or    There was an unfinished building over
there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished
building they could gradually carry everything over there Then things more
or less calmed down I tried to call my boss

Later there was more noise We were on the third floor in a onebedroom
apartment and a woman lives in the onebedroom place on the second floor
Asya Dallakian She's an old woman retired She wasn't at home at that
time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and
her grandson is in the army She is only very rarely in town she gets her
retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant They started
pounding on her door and broke it down She had two or three beds in there
something like that she's a to yearold woman who really does not even
live there Probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and
mattresses and a television When her grandson came she bought a television
They started wrecking everything I started getting sick again I think My
God what is going on around here When will this end We turned off the
lights and sat As it turns out the people who weren't afraid the ones who
knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights We didn't know but
they didn't come to where we were all the same They all knew very well that
he was a captain He went out and closed the door and we sat in his
apartment His last name was Kasumov He's an exserviceman retired works up
at the fire station at some plant or other He went out and stood at his door
They tell him Comrade Captain don't worry we won't harm you you're one of
us He went upstairs and they say Aren't you taking anything from this
apartment He says I don't need anything And the women who were standing
in the yard    we have a basement full of water    the women who were
standing in the yard saw Those guys they left everything they stole on the
first floor and ran upstairs again The women threw everything they had time
to into the basement to save our property Some things were left dirty
pillows two or three other things and a rug A guy came downstairs really
mad and he says Where's the rug I just put it right here They tell him
Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school He ran off in that
direction

Oh I forgot the most important point When Igor picked me up in his arms
there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on They
just didn't tell me about it for a long time The wife of that military man
she didn't want to kill my spirit I was already dead enough Later she told
me that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them
the ringleader apparently a young man said Where's the girl who was here
And he became furious The woman tells him She came to     She didn't
know what to say Think something up Someone carried her off Then they would
comb the whole house and find me and our whole family So the woman says She
came to and went to the basement Now our basement is full of water So the
whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse They took
flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been
standing there for years and soot and fuel oil They climbed down in there
to get me Then one of them said There's so much water down there she
probably walked and walked and then passed out and died She met her death in
the basement That's it we can leave no problem I didn't know that and
when I was told I felt worse Two times worse A lot worse So they didn't
just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me   

After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer We really
didn't want to go back to our apartment When we moved I went up there and
started to quiver and shake all over because I started remembering it all
Although the neighbors all sobbed it was all    so cheap    The people
who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that I think
that they could have helped I don't think that they were obligated to but
they could have helped us Because that one woman was able to stop that whole
brutal crowd by herself That means they could have too It would have been
enough foe one man or women to say What do you think you're doing That's
all That would have done it There were  apartments in our building Not
one person said it When I was lying on the ground and all those people were
standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice no one said what are
you doing leave her alone    Mamma even told one of the neighbor women
that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a
bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian They would have stood up for
one of their own True they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway
an old sick woman tried to stop the pogrom The Azerbaijanis have a custom
if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed
to stop immediately The old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they
stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said If
you want to go on living you'll disappear into your apartment So she left
That trick didn't work on them

Even the neighbors who helped us move told me OK fine calm down forget
that it happened I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it
had happened to their daughterand if that didn't have any effect on them
then I would forget everything too Imagine that it happened to your sister
And no one did anything Anything

RTw     JEWISH GROUP SUED FOR PASSING OFFICIAL INFORMATION

    By Adrian Croft
     SAN FRANCISCO April  Reuter  Nineteen people including the son of
former Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Arens sued the AntiDefamation League
ADL on Wednesday accusing the Jewish group of disclosing confidential
official information about them
     Richard Hirschhaut director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL art
dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants
in the suit filed in San Francisco County Superior Court
     The  accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith a group dedicated to fighting
antiSemitism and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on
them including data from state and federal agencies
     The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others including the
governments of Israel and South Africa in what it alleges was a a massive
spying operation
     The action is a classaction suit It was filed on behalf of about 
antiapartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the
plaintiffs believe the ADL Bullock and Gerard gathered information
     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available
for comment on Wednesday
     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that
Gerard a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit passed
confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring
     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL Bullock and
Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco
and Los Angeles
     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California
which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources
It seeks exemplary damages of at least  per person as well as other
unspecified damages
     Lawyer Pete McCloskey a former Congresmen who is representing the
plaintiffs said the  plaintiffs included ArabAmericans and Jews  and his
wife Helen who also had information gathered about her
     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens a research scientist at the
University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence
Minister
     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on
him in the s presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of
Palestinians and his position on the Israelioccupied territories
     According to court documents released last week Bullock and Gerard both
kept information on thousands of California political activists
     In the documents a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid
Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and
Bullock received confidential information from the authorities
     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case The ADL Bullock and
Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing

APn     ADL Lawsuit

By CATALINA ORTIZ
 Associated Press Writer
   SAN FRANCISCO AP  ArabAmericans and critics of Israel sued the
AntiDefamation League on Wednesday saying it invaded their privacy by
illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network
   The ADL a national group dedicated to fighting antiSemitism intended to
use the data to discredit them because of their political views according to
the classaction lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court
   None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or antiSemitism or hate
crimes or any of the other isms' that the ADL claims to protect against None
of us is violent or criminal in any way said Carol ElShaieb an education
consultant who develops programs on Arab culture
   The  plaintiffs include Yigal Arens son of former Israel Defense Minister
Moshe Arens The younger Arens a research scientist at the University of
Southern California said the ADL kept a file on him in the s presumably
because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians
   The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American  or speaks
politically against Israel is at least a closet antiSemite Arens said
   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing but couldn't comment on the lawsuit
because it hasn't reviewed it said a spokesman at the ADL's New York
headquarters
   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that
the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups including
white supremacist and antiSemitic organizations ArabAmericans Greenpeace
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco
public television station KQED
   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government
records according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit
No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation
   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law which
forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information not otherwise
public from state or federal records
   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to persons and
entities who had no compelling need to receive it It didn't elaborate
   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut director of the ADL's office in San
Francisco He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment
   Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock an alleged ADL
informant over the past four decades and former police officer Tom Gerard
Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed
information on to Bullock
   Gerard who has retired from the police force has moved to the Philippines
Bullock's lawyer Richard Breakstone said he could not comment on the lawsuit
because he had not yet studied it





UPwe    ADL sued for allegedly spying on US residents

   SAN FRANCISCO UPI  A group of California residents filed suit Wednesday
charging the AntiDefamation League of B'nai Brith with violating their privacy
by spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments
   The classaction suit filed in San Francisco Superior Court charges the ADL
and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information
on outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories and
South Africa's apartheid policy
   The ADL refused to comment on the suit
   The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired San
Francicso police officer Tom Gerard claiming they violated privacy guarantees
in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws
   According to the suit Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidential
files in law enforcement and government computers Information from these files
were passed to the foreign governments the suit charges
   The whole concept of an organized collection of information based on
political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is
absolutely repugnant said former Rep Pete McCloskey who is representing the
plaintiffs
   The ADL's informationgathering network was revealed publicly last week when
the San Francisco District Attorney's Office released documents indicating the
group had spied on  people and  political and ethnic groups for more
than  years
   My understanding is that they the ADL consider all activity that is in
some sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbility
to investigate said Arens a research scientist at the University of Southern
California
   The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab Americanor speaks politically
against Israel is at least a closet antiSemite
   The FBI and the District Attorney's Office have been investigating the
operation for four months
   The  plaintiffs in the case include Arens the son of former Israeli
Defense Minister Moshe Arens
   In a press release the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them
psychologically and economically and accused the ADL of trying to interfere with
their freedom of speech

       First my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens
       in the WB revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation
       of the WB revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically
       revokes the right of for its military men Clearly occupation is an
       undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate
 
  I'd like you to tell me in your own words who the military are wrt Israel then
  In uniform or not On duty or offduty Soldier to be or not
  That is since it's compulsory one might regard any Israeli as a
  legit target using that definition

 in uniform or not  doesnot make a difference if the person is in army
 On duty or offduty doesnot matter if the army man was on duty or on a
 vacation week
 Soldier to be or not sure i meant only military men

  Just trying to get this clear so please bear with me  As far as
  I can tell you're proposing the following rules of engagement
  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance  Please feel
  revise this preliminary draft as necessary

   Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time in uniform
     or out on duty or off  In practice since any male or female
     Israeli of military age  may be offduty military all but
     young children are acceptable targets  Since the existence of
     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent no further
     provocation is required

   To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of noncombatant
     Palestineans Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans
     without positive identification as military personnel clear
     indication of aggressive intent and a clear field of fire

    a Positive identification may be assured by either checking for
       Palestinean military uniform by posession of exclusively
       military armament ie T MBTs or MiG aircraft or
       selfidentification either verbal or documentary  Note
       that dualuse militarycivilian weaponry such as hand grenades
       AK rifles and RPG launchers do not constitute positive
       military identification and require closer inspection such
       as document checks

    b Aggressive intent as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent
       which is the normal condition may be assured by not less
       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals
       of not less than ten seconds between rounds  Note that a
       single burst of automaticweapon fire counds as one round
       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source
       As noted above dualuse weaponry may NOT be assumed to
       originate from military personnel and thus do not justify
       armed response

    c A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive
       military identification of all personnel in the target area of
       the weapons to be used  Note that aggressive intent need not
       be proven for all possible targets  Thus if IAF aircraft
       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the
       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously
       civilians as indicated for instance by the posession of
       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones axes and Molotov
       coctails  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to
       land and make the necessary checks ground forces should
       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire
       For ACM purposes a cockpittocockpit pass within  meters
       is usually sufficient for this purpose but may be repeated
       if necessary

IMHO it does not really matter who started any individual battle within
the ArabsIsreal war context The real question is whowhat  started the
War Does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of Israel on Arab
land 

       Huh  A war was started when several armies invaded Israel
vowing to drive the Jews into the sea  Most Jews wanted to live in
peace and the Arabs who stayed in Israel were granted citizenship

It depends entirely on how you define 'war' The actual fighting largely
predates the Arab invasions  after all Deir Yassin happened in midApril
well before the Arab invasion As I have said elsewhere Lt Col Lorch has
said that Hagana forces were fighting well before the Arabs invaded as in
months before As for Jews wanting to live in peace that to is entirely
arguable I think it is easy enough to show that the Labour party leadership
had no such intention at all As for the Arabs who 'stayed' don't you mean
those who were not expelled Even some of those who did 'stay' were not
granted citizenship but expelled after the fighting had stopped anyway

Joseph Askew


How do you define war  Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages
count as acts of war or is that only when the Jews do them
January  Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold
                men attack Kfar Etzion  miles south of Jerusalem
                    after cutting off the supply lines to it
Attacks on Yehiam Western Galilee and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi
By MidMarch The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from
      land links with the rest of the Jewish population
         The Etzion group of villiages near Hebron had been cut off
            while  members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were
            slaughtered cutting off the villiage
Jerusalem was under seige being cut off from its supply route from
     Tel Aviv the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side
     of that road to this day in memoriam  By this time  Jews
     had been killed

Of course this isn't war since it's only the Arabs attacking
Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets
against Northern israel  Where does uprising end and war begin
Will it still be 'Intifadah' when the PLO brings in tanks

You know when Israelis F thanks to General Dynamics fly high in the sky

If you Arabs wouldn't position guerilla bases in refugee camps artillery
batteries atop apartment buildings and munitions dumps in hospitals maybe
civilians wouldn't get killed  Kinda like Saddam Hussein putting civilians
in a military bunker

Ed

 Who is the you Arabs here  Since you are replying to my article you
 are assuming that I am an Arab  Well I'm not an Arab but I think you
 are brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said  The
 bombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in Lebanon by Israel is
 very consistent with its policy of intimidation  That is the only
 policy that has been practiced by the so called only democracy in
 the middle east

 I was merley pointing out that the other side is also suffering
 Like I said I'm not an Arab but if I was say a Lebanese you bet
 I would defende my homeland against any invader by any means

Tell me then would you also fight the Syrians in Lebanon

Oh no of course not They would be your brothers and you would
tell that you invited them

Ahhh of course Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events
like the string of PLOrun skyjackings in the mid 's remember those
TWA jokes and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline
bombings they have committed not to mention bombings on the streets of
Israel It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any
bags or containers whose origins they don't know because they could be
bombs or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah
those wonderful mainstream moderates with whom Israel is attempting
to negotiate

Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians
than by Israelis  Ahh yes those charming humanitarian death squads
I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation DSee the documentary
Deadly Currentsvery neutral and balancedseriouslyIt was rather
inquisitionesque essentially to prove his loyalty to the cause of
whichever group it was that was interogating him he had to turn in someone
else or else face death in one of the many funfilled ways that the death
squads love so muchbeatings dismemberment acid pouring melted plastic
on the face of the 'guilty party' and of course beheading always my
favorite  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back
the execution of a collaborator   photos
 one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint
 The collaborator on his knees the gun pointed at his temple
 The executioner standing on the corpse of the collaborator
shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators

Wonderful justice system and lots of regard for Human rights
Remember Black September
Ok so they just tried to take over Jordan big deal

I'm rambling now but are you getting what I'm saying

 Even the most extemist one sided jewishisraeli postings with which I
 certainly disagree did not openly back plain murder You do

 The 'Lebanese resistance' you are talking about is a bunch of lebanese
 farmers who detonate bombs after work or is an organized entity of not
 onlylebanese well trained mercenaries  I do not know just curious

 I guess you also back the killings of hundreds of marines in Beirut right

 What kind of 'resistance' movement killed jewish attlets in Munich  

 You liked it didn't you 


 You posted some other garbage before so at least you seem to be consistent

 Dorin

Dorin
Let's not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered The
distinction is not trivial Murder happens to innocent people not people
whose line of work is to kill or be killed It just so happened that these
soldiers in the line of duty were killed by the opposition And
resistance is different from terrorism Certainly the athletes in Munich
were victims of terrorists though some might call them freedom fighters
Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by
resistance fighters Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the
Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the
hostile occupiers in WWII Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the
Lebanese people are tired of being occupied They are now turning to the
only option they see as viable Don't forget that it worked in driving
out the US

I just thought that I would make it clear in case you are not familiar with
my past postings on this subject I do not condone attacks on civilians
Hezbollah and other Lebanese Resistance fighters are skilled at precision
bombing of SLA and Israeli targets I find such methods to be far more
restrained and responsible than the Israeli method of shelling and bombing
villages with the hope that a Hezbollah member will be killed along with
the civilians murdered I do not consider the killing of combatants to be
murder Soldiers are trained to die for their country Three IDF soldiers
did their duty the other day These men need not have died if their government
had kept them on Israeli soil

Is there any Israeli a civilian in your opinion 

Now I do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of villages
But you claim these are villages with civilians and Iraelis claim they are
camps filled with terrorists You claim that israelis shell the villages with the
'hope' of finding a terrorist or so If they kill one fine if not too bad
civilians die right  I am not so sure

As somebody wrote Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting
manner And he also claimed 'civilians murdered' Let me ask you isn't there
at least a slight chance that you not only and the question is very general
no insult are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in
southern Lebanon 

Now a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea
How do you define Israeli soil  From what you say if you do not clearly
recognize the state of Israel you condone killing israelis anywhere

Dorin are you aware that the IDF sent helicopters and gunboats up the
coast of Lebanon the other day and rocketted a Palestinian refugee north of
Beirut Perhaps I should ask YOU what qualifies a person for murder

I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe If it was
to kill civilians I doubt I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT If civilians were
killed i do not condone it

That they are Palestinian

That they are children and may grow up to be terrorists

That they are female and may give birth to little terrorists

Brad Hernlem hernlemchessncsuEDU

Mr Hernlem it was YOU not ME who was showing a huge satisfaction for 
israelis human beings by most standards Don't know about your standards killed

If you ask me those questions I will have no problem answering not with a
question as you did  No NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder nothing
justifies murder I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make
similar statements maybe after eliminating all Israelis jews  Am I wrong 


Now tell me did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in let's
say Tel Aviv  From what I understand a lot of palestineans cheered What does
it show It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me  But again I may be
wrong and the jewish controlled media distorted the information and I am just
an ignorant victim of the media like most of us

I am not in the business of reading minds however in this case it would not
be necessary  Israelis top leaders in the past and present always come across
as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs

The way I see it Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace
after almost  years of fighting because of the following two major reasons

  Arab governments are not really representative of their people currently
    most of their leaders are stupid andor not independent andor
    dictators

  Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising

 Well Panos Mr Tamamidis the way you put it it is only the Turks
 who bear the responsibility of the things happening today That is hard to
 believe for somebody trying to be objective
 When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
 blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides
 What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW anyway
 Do you think it was your right to be there

There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor until 
Someone had to protect them If not us who

 I am not saying that conflicts started with that It is only
 not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
 It is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
 I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
 visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey I thought it
 was a positive attempt to make the relations better

Compromise on what the invasion of Cyprus the involment of Turkey in
Greek politics the refusal of Turkey to accept  miles of territorial
waters as stated by international law the properties of the Greeks of
Konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the Greek lakesorry Aegean

There are some things on which there can not be a compromise


 The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
 people They have never met me but they know I am bad person
 because I am from Turkey Politics is not my business and it is
 not the business of most of the Turks When it comes to individuals
 why the hatred

Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or
indirecly is a bad person
It is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support of the
actions of your goverment that make you bad
People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you
are You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and
as a such you must pay the price

 So that makes me think that there is some kind of
 brainwashing going on in Greece After all why would an educated person
 treat every person from a nation the same way can you tell me about your
 history books and things you learn about GreekTurkish
 encounters during your schooling
 take it easy

 
 Tankut Atan
 tankutiastateedu

 Achtung baby

You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks Just talk to
Greeks Arabs Slavs Kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under
Turkish occupation
They will talk to you about murdersrapesdistruction

You do not learn about Turks from history books you learn about them from
people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness

Hossien Amehdi writes

I am not in the business of reading minds however in this case it would not
be necessary  Israelis top leaders in the past and present always come across
as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs

The way I see it Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace
after almost  years of fighting because of the following two major reasons

  Arab governments are not really representative of their people currently
    most of their leaders are stupid andor not independent andor
    dictators

  Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising



It's not relevant whether I agree with you or not there is some reasonable
thought in what you say here an I appreciate your point However I would make 
remarks

  you forgot about hate and this is not only at government level
  It's not only 'arab' governments

Now about taugh talk and arrogance we are adults aren't we  Do you listen
to tough talk of american politicians  or switch  the channel 
I would rather be 'intimidated' by some dummy 'talking tough' then by a
bomb ready to blow under my seat in B

Dear Marc
	I believe that you are wrong about Mr Freeman  He has written in
a style that raises the level of posts on this board  If you just don't seem
to get it I believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities
than of him  His posts contain substance and and he defends his positions
well
	Having said this I would like to ask in general for people on this
board to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts then they should respond to the substance or lack of of the posts rather than attack
the author of the posts  When one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what heshe has written one can see that that person does not have the
ability to make a coherent argument concerning the post

Peace

If this is your targetwellthat tells a lot about you


 Can Nick Steel provide documentation for this alleged incident 

Did you really think he is talking about something realistic


 Harry

 You must be kidding this is not a single incident
 now This has become a daily life practice in Gazza
 if you mean the killing of children by armed soldiers

Yeahwellsometimeswhen cowards put their children and wives in the front line
so their enemy cannot do anythingwellmaybe in those casesyou have no better
thing to do to save your life than shooting And if parents want their
children aliveI think it would be better that before they get out to throw
stonesmolotov botllesor when they come to kill solidersto keep their children
in the houses


 If you are objecting the number of occupying israeli
  soldiers terrorists or  the way they do it  then
             
                         Look in the dictionary at the word terrorism It
			 says nu the use of threats of violenceand violence
			 esp for political purposes
			 It sounds more like your guys

 I caan assure you that they do worse than that Just as

Yeah WellI guess you were in thereand you know it all

 example   children were killed this month of Ramadhan
 two of them by military vehicules  An other similar
 incident by vehicule was the one of  Feb  Ramadhan
 where thee military truck on purpose hit a passenger
                             
                           Where from do you know that it was on purpose
			   PersonallyI didn't hear about this casealthough
			   I don't deny itBut how can ANYBODYbesides the
			   person itselfcan say it was on purpose

 car where the victims were a  year girl Safa Sail
 Bisharat
 and Saamud Riyad a  weeks old babygirl  the 
 oldd Raajij Rouhy

YeahsureThe truck driver looked in the car with his Zionist Equipment of
Detecting Palestinian Childrenand then he thought to himselfHey there is a
 year  and  weeks girls in the carWhy won't I make an accident and kill
the enemy Maximum I will die too in the crashBut what do I care

 
 Hakim

Actually if can remember correctly was it not reported and even on camera
some time during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon or when the itifada began
that CNN caught regular uniformed Israeli soldiers breaking the arms of
some Arab youngsters in a very professional and brutal manner someone
please give full details if they can remember This is one of the few

WellIt was about  years ago in the Intifada The fact that  you can't
remember the time prooves how much do you care about it I DO NOT think
that what the soliders did was correct But I will not agree that they were
breaking their armsI saw that filmandunlike in the USAit was broadcasted
entirely not long ago in a talk show and at the end the armbroken guys got
up and walked and used their arms very good They guy who did it was interviewed
and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take
his ordersand spitted in his face What ammount of truth exist in this
statement I cannot tell youbecause I wasn't there But the guy who did it was
in prisonif it makes you any good

occassions on which such a scene has been transmitted to the West and
in the USA  it caused uproar and was one of the factors that has significantly
changed the preception of the Israeli army's role in the mideast

Noit didn't The Israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle
eastIt is still the only human armyas much as an ARMY can be humanTo any
American who will claim the oppositeI can only remember the CNN broadcasting
of the American Solider who beat a Somalian boy It was very cruel to seeBut
I won't say because of this that the American army is cruel


So there is proof for you It is obvious that is a systematic policy of the
Israelis which must be occurring on a massive scale behind the scenes

Some kind of proof Obvious Where from If you say it is behind the scenes
how do you know about it

                  Mr Tamamidis

Before repling your claims I suggest you be kind to individuals
who are trying to make some points abouts human rights discriminations
and unequal treatment of Turkish minority in GREECEI want the World
know how bad you treat these people You will deny anything I say but
It does not make any difrence because I will write things that I saw with
my eyesYou prove yourself prejudice by saying free insurance school
etc Do you Greeks only give these things to Turkish minority or
everybody has rights to get themYour words even discriminate
these people You think that you are giving big favor to these
people by giving these thing that in reality they get nothing

 No I do not thing we are doing them a favor  I have simply stated that
 they are not treated as a second class citizens That was my point
 I fail to see how my words show discrimination And what do you mean that
 they do not get nothing Is for example helth insurance food and tuition
 nothing

If you do not know unhuman practices that are being conducted
by the Government of the Greece I suggest that you investigate
to see the facts Then we can discuss about the most basic
human rights like fredom of religion fredom of press of Turkish
minority ethnic cleansing of all Turks in Greecefredom of
right to have property without government intervention
fredom of right to vote to choose your community leaders
how Greek Government encourages people to destroy
religious places houses farms schools for Turkish minority then
forcing them to go to turkey without anything with them

 I'm sorry but I cannot see any logical order in the above argument

Before I conclude my writing let me point out how Greeks are
treated in Turkey We do not consider them Greek minority instead
we consider a part of our society

 What part exactly is this one The people cannot even sell their property
 if they want to leave Turkey  The patriarch could not get a permision to
 renovate some buildings for decades it needed a special agreement between
 the two goverments for this Talk about a part of the society Why has the
 size of the Greek community reduced to  old people and priests then

There is no difference among people in Turkey

 Yeah you bet

All big businesses
belong to Greeks in Turkey and we are proud to have themunlike the
Greece which tries to destroy Turkish minority We encourage all
minorities in Turkey to be a part of Turkish society

 You are far off from the reality

revisionist myopic and incidental view of themselves and their place in the
world

The resulting inability to address Armenian and Greek refutations of Turkeys
rewrite of history is to refer to me as a terrorist and worse claim

I am not saying that conflicts started with that It is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
It is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey I thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better

 I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists
 I bet that this week there should be about  tourists from Greece
 in Turkey  Each one will leave at least  so go and figure what this
 means to your economy  If you had kept the visa requirement how many
 Greeks would bother to visit Turkey

Smart indeed  If what you're saying is true Greeks who visit are happy
the Turkish merchants are happy who is harmed  No one  So not only was
it a smart move it was also a good move for it adds to the happiness of
 Greeks per week and however many Turkish merchants they interact with
One simple move in the paperwork arena  lotsa happy people of both
nationalities  Just and observation

There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program
about Iranian bomb Here is my  on this and related subjects

One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related
public relations campaign about Iran in recent months These include

 Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade
   Center Despite great efforts in this direction they have not
   succeeded in this They however have indirectly created
   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist
   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter

 Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and
   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and
   outlaw state

 And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program I
   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and
   perhaps intensify

Why this increased pressure on Iran A number of factors may have
been behind this These include

 The rise of Islamic movements in NorthAfrica and radical
   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories This
   movement is basically antiwestern and is not necessarily
   fueled by Iran The cause for accelerated pace of this
   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return
   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of
   democracy and freedom Also the obvious support of Algerian
   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian
   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth
   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news
   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems

 Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia
   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil
   sources from this region

 A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense
   expenditures This has become necessary after the demise of
   Soveit Union

The recent PR campaign against Iran however seems to be directed
from Israel rather than Washington There is no fundamental conflict
of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion it is in the
interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal
and friendly relations This may have a moderating effect on the
rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran

Where the hell do you get off calling it Arab land  Jews have been
living there for a long time  Jews didn't just start arriving in 
they've been living there for thousands of years except for periods when
they were expelled but they always returned home

   CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES published book you'll find accounts of the
   massacres there including Deir Yassen
   though with the numbers of massacred men children and women are
   greatly minimized

As per request of Hasan

From The Revolt by Menachem Begin Dell Publishing NY 

pp 

    Apart from the military aspect there is a moral aspect to the
story of Dir Yassin At that village whose name was publicized
throughout the world both sides suffered heavy casualties We had
four killed and nearly forty wounded The number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers The Arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy The fighting
was thus very severe Yet the hostile propaganda disseminated
throughout the world deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women
children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle A substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt A few did not leave their
stone houses  perhaps because of the confusion The fire of the enemy
was murderous  to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony Our men were compelled to fight for every house to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades And the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties

    The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war We
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us in
accordance with the accepted custom of war to apply reprisals I am
convinced too that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle But those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin  would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy 

    In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah whom Mr
Ben Gurion at a moment of great political emotion called 'the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country' The 'wise
ruler' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey replied with feudal
superciliousness He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of
'dissidents' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities'

    The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name In the
result it helped us Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel
Kolonia village which had previously repulsed every attack of the
Haganah was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting
BeitIksa was also evacuated These two places overlooked the main
road and their fall together with the capture of Kastel by the
Haganah made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem In the
rest of the country too the Arabs began to flee in terror even
before they clashed with Jewish forces Not what happened at Dir
Yassin but what was invented about Dir Yassin helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield The legend of Dir
Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the
conquest of Haifa


 A footnote from The Revolt pp To counteract the loss
of Dir yassin a village of strategic importance Arab headquarters at
Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story alleging a massacre by
Irgun troops of women and children in the village Certain Jewish
officials fearing the Irgun men as political rivals seized upon this
Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun An eminent Rabbi was induced
to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth Out of
evil however good came This Arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops who were seized with panic at
the mention of Irgun soldiers The legend was worth half a dozen
battalions to the forces of Israel The Dir Yassin Massacre' lie
is still propagated by Jewhaters all over the world

 In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews

 FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS

Hadashot  March 

The Israeli Police Department announced on the evening of Friday
March  that it is calling upon Jewish Israeli citizens with
gun permits to carry them at all times so as to contribute to
their security and that of their surroundings

    Considering all the murders of innocent Israelis at the hands
    of Arab death merchants I see nothing wrong with the advice

Ha'aretz  March 

Yehoshua Matza Likud Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee
stated that he intends to demand that the police department make
it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills
nonJewish terrorists will not be put on trial

    As usual the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes
    through this newsgroup  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who
    is venting his spleen and you portray it as if this is going
    to become policy  You don't say what the response to Matza's
    suggestion was  Do do not mention whether he was refering to
    terrorists caught in the act which could be a clear cut case
    of selfdefence  Would you care to elaborate on this or was
    this all you wanted to say on the matter  Why don't you give
    up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap and just post your
    biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name

Ha'aretz  March

Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern
Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza
strip as an additional stage in the upgrading of security
measures in the Strip

The gates will aid in the searching of nonJewish Gaza residents
as they leave for work in Israel They can be used to reveal the
presence of knives axes weapons and other sharp objects

In addition to the gates which will be operated by a private
civilian company large quantities of magneticcard reading
devices are being brought to the inspection points to facilitate
the reading of the magnetic cards these nonJewish workers must
carry

    A laudable precaution

    Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray
    Israel as negatively as you can  Deliberate omissions are an
    integral part of the shtick  And it's not only the incidents
    that you do not mention but even the stories you do post are
    fraught with omissions which change the entire meaning  The
    absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias

    In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light you
    have accomplished nothing except to prove that a respectable
    sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing
    but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude
    against Israel and the need to vent it  You

David posts a good translation of a post by Suat Kinikliouglu

most of the original post elided

   KK  VATAN SEVGISI RUHLARI KIRDEN KURTARAN EN KUVVETLI RUZGARDIR 

   In translation as a public service

most of the translation elided

    THE LOVE OF THE FATHERLAND IS THE STRONGEST OF ALL WINDS CLEANSING
         FILTH OFF SOULS 

I think this part of the translation is questionable Although I
think the original quote is plain silly you made it sound as if
it is coming from a neonazi youth For example Turks talk of a
motherland not a Germanic fatherland Why filth instead of
dirt The indeterminacy of translation is a wellknown problem
 so one may have to fudge but with some care of course Is
the following an equally valid translation

The love of one's country is the strongest wind to cleanse one's
soul

See my point

Nevertheless I think you translate well

 Assuming Also come on Brad If we are going to get anywhere in
 this or any discussion it doesn't help to bring up elements I never
 addressed nor commented on in any way I made no comment on who is
 right or who is wrong only that civilians ARE being used as cover
 and that having been placed in between the Israelis and the guerillas
 they will be injured as both parties continue their fight

Pardon me Tim but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail
to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which
killed the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and
whereabouts of all of them Several villages were shelled How could the IDF
possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted
villages You see it was an arbitrary act of retaliation

I will again repeat my statement  I do not condone these
indiscriminate Israeli acts nor have I ever  If the villagers do not know who these guerillas are which you stated earlier how do you expect the
Israelis to know It is very difficult to identify who they are this
is why the guerillas prefer to lose themselves in the general population
by dressing the same acting the same etc

 The host Arab state did littlenothing to try and stop these attacks
 from its side of the border with Israel

The problem Tim is that the original reason for the invasion was Palestinian
attacks on Israel NOT Lebanese attacks

I agree but because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these
attacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its
situation Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control
this third party state within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept
occuring At what point does Israel or ANY state have the right to do
something ITSELF to stop such attacks Never
 
 While the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars
 have been removed the weapons needed to crossborder attacks still
 remain to some extent Rocket attacks still continue and commando
 raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard
 for human life yours of that of others Such attacks also continue

Yes I am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify
occupying your neighbor's land Israel must resolve its disputes with the
native Palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks

It is also the responsibility of any state to NOT ALLOW any outside
party to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state If  Angola
had the power and  South Africa refused or couldn't stop antiAngolan
guerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola and  South Africa
refused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola
would Angola be justified in entering SA If not are you saying that
Angola HAD to accept the situation do NOTHING and absorb the attacks

 Bat guano The situation you call for existed in the s and attacks
 were commonplace

Not true Lebanese were not attacking Israel in the s With a strong
Lebanese government free from Syrian and Israeli interference I believe
that the border could be adequately patrolled The Palestinian heavy
weapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a
threat as once existed

I refered above at all times to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from
Lebanese soil NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel

One hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its
border but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger WHAT HAS
CHANGED is that the PLO was largely driven out of Lebanon not by the
Lebanese not by Syria and THAT is by far the most important making it
EASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil That
change was brought about by Israeli action the PLO would never
have been ejected by Lebanese Arab state or UN actions

Please Tim don't fall into the trap of treating Lebanese and Palestinians
as all part of the same group There are too many who think all Arabs or all
Muslims are the same Too many times I have seen people support the bombing
of Palestinian camps in retaliation for an IDF death at the hands of the
Lebanese Resistance or the shelling of Lebanese villages in retaliation for
a Palestinian attack

I fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be used by EITHER side
and have been and continue to be But the most fundamental issue is that
if a state cannot control its borders and make REAL efforts to do so it
should expect others to do it for them Hopefully that other will be
the UN but it is as we see in its cowardice regarding Bosnia weak

Tell me Tim what are these guerillas doing wrong Assuming that they are using
civilians for cover are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country

So it's okay to use civilians for cover if you're attacking soldiers
in your country  Of course many of those attacking claim that they
aren't Lebanese so it's not their country

Got it  I think  Hmm  This is confusing

Could you perhaps repeat your rules explaining exactly when it is
permissible to use civilians as shields  Also please explain under
what conditions it is permissible for soldiers to defend themselves
Also please explain the particular rules that make it okay for
terrorists to launch missiles from Lebanon against Israeli civilians
but not okay for the Israelis to try to defend themselves against
those missiles

 FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS

 Paper Zman Tel Aviv Tel Aviv's time Friday local Tel Aviv's
 paper affiliated with Maariv

 Date  February 

 Journalist Guy Ehrlich

 Subject Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan
 Cherry units which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate
 within the occupied territories

 Excerpts from the article

 A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as
 Arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods But the most
 important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with It is
 that everyone who serves in the Cherry after a time goes in one
 way or another insane


Gee I'd better tell this to the Mental Health Branch of the Israeli Army
Medical Corps  Where would we be without  you Davidson 






 A man who said this who will here be called Danny his full name
 is known to the editors served in the Cherry After his discharge
 from the army he works as delivery boy His pal who will here be
 called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry and is now about to
 depart for a roundtheworld tour They both look no different
 from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript
 service But in their souls one can notice something completely
 differentIt was not easy for them to come out with disclosures
 about what happened to them And they think that to most of their
 fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either Yet after they
 began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking
 The following article will contain all the horror stories
 recounted with an appalling openness

  A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team in
 which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry We
 called such soldiers HI 'Hit by the Intifada' Under my command
 was a soldier who talked to himself nonstop which is a common
 phenomenon in the Cherry I sent him to a psychiatrist But why I
 should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane  On
 Fridays when I come home my parents know I cannot be talked to
 until I go to the beach surf a little calm down and return The
 keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance so that I
 can go there I they dare talk to me before or whenever I don't
 want them to talk to me I just grab a chair and smash it
 instantly I know it is my nerve  Smashing chairs all the time
 and then running away from home to the car and to the beach Only
 there I become normal

  Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother
 It was an omelette of sorts She took the risk of sitting next to
 me and talking to me I then told my mother about an event which
 was still fresh in my mind I told her how I shot an Arab and how
 exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it She began
 to laugh hysterically I wanted her to cry and she dared laugh
 straight in my face instead  So I told her how my pal had made a
 mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov
 cocktails He shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as
 they deserved One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire with
 the effect that the Arab was burning all over just beautifully I
 was delighted to see it  My pal fired three bullets two at the
 Arab with the Molotov cocktail and the third at his chum It hit
 him straight in his ass We both felt that we'd pulled off
 something

 Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts
 in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that
 spot to take a look I reached the spot first And then that Arab
 blood gushing forth from his body spits at me I yelled 'Shut
 up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew So I just laughed
 straight in his face I am usually laughing when I stare at
 something convulsing right before my eyes Then I told him 'All
 right wait a moment' I left him in order to take a look at
 another wounded Arab I asked a soldier if that Arab could be
 saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the
 help of a stone of something else like that I keep telling all
 this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight
 into my face This infuriated me I got very angry because I felt
 I was becoming mad So I stopped eating seized the plate with he
 omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over
 her head Only then she stopped laughing At first she didn't know
 what to say

  But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls
 upon us frequently I went with a friend to practice shooting on a
 field A gull appeared right in the middle of the field My friend

Sigh

Four  deer in Tel Aviv  Well this is probably as accurate as the rest of
this fantasy





 hill above us My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it
 We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock We shot down two
 deer more and went to take a look When we climbed the rocks we
 saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to
 such some milk from its already dead mother We carefully
 inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of
 the two deer we had hit We were just delighted by that sight We
 had hit'em so good  Then we decided to kill the young deer too
 so as spare it further suffering I approached took out my
 revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short
 distance When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the
 bullets sinking in  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall
 outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of
 blood straight on us This made us feel cured of the spurt of our
 madness Standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like
 beasts of prey We couldn't explain what had happened to us We
 were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we
 felt the whole day very badly

  We always go back to places we carried out assignments in
 This is why we can see them When you see a guy you disabled may
 be for the rest of his life you feel you got power You feel
 Godlike of sorts

  Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment
 studying the acting Dudu is not willing to work in any
 securitylinked occupation Danny feels the exact opposite 'Why
 shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well 
 Why shouldn't I earn  for each chopped head I would deliver
 while being a mercenary in South Africa  This kind of job suits
 me perfectly I have no human emotions any more If I get a
 reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to
 Bosnia in order to fight there

 Title of article Moderate physical pressure

 Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation
 room in Tulkarm prison during which he says he was humiliated
 beaten and tortured Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator a
 Shabak agent 'Captain Louis' chatting on the phone with his wife
 At those moments Omar said I felt that he was like a
 humanbeing but right after he finished talking he would be beat
 me and say 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed
 yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being

 In late October  after  days in detention at Tulkarm
 prison Omar Jaber was released without charges Among the Jews
 as among the Arabs there are good people and bad people he said
 after his release but there in Tulkarm in the interrogations
 rooms you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that
 he is a human being Although he left the detention installation
 in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated I sat at home for ten days My
 hands shook from nerves one may consider Omar Jaber lucky He
 got out not so healthy but entire and even ultimately returned
 to normal functioning at the small solar heater plant he owns

 In contrast Hassan Bader alZbeidi for example was released
 seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after  days in the
 Shabak wing cut off from his surroundings He doesn't speak or
 react Mustafa Barakat aged only  who was arrested in early
 August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation left
 it one day later  dead We have recently received an especially
 large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at
 the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators noted
 Dr Niv Gordon director of the Association of Israel and
 Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights 

 The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan
 Saber Makhlouf a  year old student In fact he was extremely
 fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated
 in Tulkarm prison in case the publication in the paper would
 return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment

 follow description of tortures

 Omar a tall bearded man was silent I do not want to talk about
 it he finally said quietly Some time later embarrased and
 ashamed he spoke Sometimes he beats you and beats you until
 you'll kiss his hand and not only his hand Even the hands of
 another interrogator and another whom he calls into the room
 and the last interrogator says Now you are kissing my hand and
 later if I want you will kiss my ass

 These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation
 located within the military government compound in Tulkarm West
 Bank But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom In
 early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem the
 Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories to
 visit Tulkarm prison but denied them access to the interrogation
 wing The interrogation wing is Shabak property being solely
 under Shabak responsibility All interrogations are performed by
 it said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an the commander of the
 installation according to the internal report written by B'tselem
 member Yuval Ginbar following the visit Major David Pe'er
 governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command
 was quoted in the report  There is an ethical problem here  no
 one can enter the interrogation wing

Hmm  Maybe I'll go rent Midnight Express tonight  I haven't seen that
scene in awhile I have to savor the moment all over again

Well does it change the fact that during the period of  to 
the fascist xSoviet Armenian Government ordered incited assisted
and participated in the genocide of  million Muslim people because
of race religion and national origin

As in the past in Turkiye and today in Azerbaijan for utopic and
idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors A
shortsighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda
and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious
for the region As usual they will be treated accordingly by their
neighbors NagornoKarabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely
within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to
xSoviet Armenia Besides the geographical aspect NagornoKarabag is
the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary
heritage of Azerbaijan which renders the Armenian claims preposterous
even lunatic

And we still demand

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government as the heirs of the Armenian
dictatorship recognize the Turkish Genocide

 that xSoviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their
heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide

 that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide
and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian
political pressure

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first
genocide of the th century as a positive step

Now what would you do

    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES

    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former
Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with coldblooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in warracked NagornoKarabakh
    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more
than   Azeris many of  them women and  children who were  fleeing an
attack  on their  town Hundreds  possibly thousands  were missing  and
feared dead
    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending
the women  and children  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified
refugees The few  survivors later described what  happened That's when
the real  slaughter began said  Azer Hajiev  one of three  soldiers to
survive The  Armenians just shot and  shot And then they  came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives
     They were shooting shooting shooting echoed Rasia Aslanova who
arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through
Armenian lines She said her husband Kayun and a soninlaw were killed
in front of her Her daughter was still missing
    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off

    The survivors  said   others some of  whom had  fled separately
were still missing in the gruelling terrain many could perish from their
wounds or the cold
    By late  yesterday  deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in
Agdam's morgue  and  bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery  Of the
seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial two  were children and  three were
women one shot through the chest at point blank range
    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror  Doctors said they
had  patients who escaped slaughter most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds
    Nor were they safe in Agdam On friday night rockets fell on the city
which  has a  population  of   destroying  several buildings  and
killing one person

 Maybe with the availability of anon servers some people are beginning to
speak out

I sure hope so Because the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must
be righted Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of
Urartus massacred and exterminated its population and presented to
the world all those left from the Urartus as the Armenian civilization

All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly
exterminated  million Muslim women children and elderly people of
Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the
Ottoman Empire between 

It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators
of the Nazis during World War II and that even today criminalNazi
members of the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate
racism hatred violence and terrorism among peoples

And xSoviet Armenia continues its antiTurkish policy in the following
ways

 xSoviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility

 xSoviet Armenia employing ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism
Triangle and criminalNazi Armenians attempts to call into question the
veracity of the Turkish Genocide

 xSoviet Armenia has also implemented statesponsored terrorism through
the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests

 Using all its human financial and governmental resources xSoviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism bribery and other subversive methods nonTurkish supporters
of the Turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian

Using all the aforementioned methods the xSoviet Armenian government
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue

Yet despite the efforts of the xSoviet Armenian government and its terrorist
and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks to the struggle
of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians
the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse and
consequently a number of governments and organizations have become
supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide

	Simple question Serdar

Anytime

	If the Armenians killed so many Turks in Eastern Anatolia
how come the area today is full of Turks and Muslim Kurds and
not full of Armenians

Suffering from a severe case of myopia No Muslim left alive  not a
single one Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman
border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman
Parliamentary representative for Erzurum Karekin Pastirmaciyan who
assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo Another former Ottoman
parliamentarian Hamparsum Boyaciyan led the Armenian guerrilla forces
who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname Murad
especially ordering that

         'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in
          whatever circumstances you find them Turkish children
          also should be killed as they form a danger to the

In March  the Russian forces began to move toward Van Immediately
in April   the Armenians of Van began a revolt massacring all

conquest by Russians Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a

The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over  square miles The estimated population
 of the entire region in  was  of whom   percent were
 Armenian   percent Georgian and   percent Moslem
 Of the latter group  were Tatars Paradoxically barely onethird
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds Erevan
 uezd the administrative center of the province had only  Armenians
 as compared to  Moslems By the time of the Russian Census of 
 however the Armenians had established a scant majority  percent in the
 guberniia it had risen by  to  percent or  of the 
 inhabitants This impressive change in the province's ethnic character
 notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian
 Republic a solid block of  Tartars who continued to dominate the
 southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia

In  '' percent Turk

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work
 of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village
 Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets
 completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border
 into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of
 Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the

In April  Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city
 of Van whose  Armenians comprised  percent of the population
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the EmpireLeaving Erivan
 on April   Armenian volunteers reached Van on May  and organized
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during
 the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the
 southern side of the lake

Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories Armenian political leaders army officers and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves

With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in  at the beginning of
 World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies

	Also since the Ottomans were such great tolerators how come
the Armenians were counted as part of the RUM millet ie forced
under the control of the GREEK Orthodox patriarchate

Are you people for real The main legal principles of the Turkish State
are summarized in Article  of the Constitution

	The Republic of Turkey is a democratic secular and social State
	governed by the rule of law bearing in mind the concepts of public
	peace national solidarity and justice respecting human rights
	loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk and based on the fundamental
	tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution

Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire allowing
the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous The
fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be
attributed to these freedoms despite the lack of any written Constitution
The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in  and 
Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force
only temporarily they provided the basic elements of a Constitution

The  Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and
the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor The Constitution
of  placed some additional limitations on the Emperor while increasing
the power of the Parliament and the government

The First World War  brought the Ottoman Empire to an end By the
occupation of Istanbul the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was
abolished The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the
occupying forces

During the Independence War the Turkish Grand National Assembly held their
first meeting on April   to serve as the legislative body of the new
Turkish state This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish
Republic The new Republic was proclaimed on October   and the new
Constitution was adopted in  That Constitution served as the legal
backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic In  Turkey adopted a
multiparty political system The Constitution of  was replaced by
others in  and  All three Constitutions of the Republic have been
based on the principles of parliamentary democracy human rights national
sovereignty division of powers private ownership and secularization

Major Principles of the Constitution

The constitution with  Articles establishes the structure of the Republic
within the following principles

 The Turkish Republic is a democratic secular and social state governed by
  law
 It should be governed to maintain public peace national solidarity justice
  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk
 The language of the State is Turkish
 Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions
  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation
 Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation This
  power cannot be delegated transferred to any one else
 Executive power is exercised by the President and Council of Ministers
 Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the
  Turkish nation
 All individuals are equal irrespective of language race religion color
  sex or political beliefs
 Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution

Structure of the State

In accordance with the Constitution the structure of the state is based on the
principle of division of power to create a balanced and selfcontrolled
system The power is divided into legislative power executive power and
judicial power balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each
other selfcontrol

 A Legislative Power

 The Turkish Grand National Assembly is a parliament with one House elected
 by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on
 behalf of the nation The basic functions of this Assembly are

  to adopt to amend or to repeal laws
  to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers
  to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers
  to debate to amend and to approve annual budgets
  to ratify international agreements
  to grant amnesty or pardons

 Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words either oral
 or written during the course of their legislative duties The country is
 divided into constituencies The number of representatives of each is
 calculated according to its population Every Turkish citizen over the age
 of twentyone can vote

 Elections are supervised by the Supreme Council of Elections which solves
 all disputes or appeals In each province the local Board of Election
 runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the
 Supreme Council Members of the Council and Boards are elected among
 independent judges

 B Executive Power

 The President of the Republic is the Head of State not the head of government
 as in the Unites States The main functions of the President are

  to represent the State and the Country
  to insure the implementation of the Constitution
  to coordinate legislative judicial and executive functions
  act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces
  to ratify laws and government decrees

 The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven
 years The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate may
 call for a referendum

 Executive power is exercised by the Council of Ministers headed by the
 Prime Minister The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the
 members of Parliament The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval
 by the President The new Government Council of Ministers reads their
 program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows There are  
 Ministers in the Council

 Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent
 administrative courts for their misuse of power administrative errors or
 functions against any law

 C Judicial Power

 Judicial power is exercised by independent courts No authority or power can
 instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts These cannot be
 discharged replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the
 reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws There are three categories
 of courts in the Turkish judiciary system

  Courts of justice deal with legal commercial and criminal cases The
   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice
   upon the appeal of the parties involved
  The decisions or functions of the executive power including the Prime
   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department can be appealed in
   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law
   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the
   high administrative court

 The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the
 Constitutional Court if they contradict the Constitution If found
 contradictory this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament

Regarding PBS' Frontine on the Iranian Bomb

     A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA  in their numerous
    visits from
    Iran's different sites They say We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not  or  We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons

	The IAEA has two conflicting goals  One is to promote the
spread of nuclear energy the other to police its use  Any successful
policing ie finding cheaters shows that its other arm is being
overzealous in its promotion of nuclear energy

	The IAEA announces in advance which sites it will visit  It
allows the country it is inspecting to veto areas on the list by
claiming they are not used for nuclear work  Its inspectors are drawn
from all over the world and few have any experience in bomb building
Such experience would make the job of determining if a site was being
used for military purposes much easier

	Unfortunately many countries object to knowledgeable
inspectors because the only really knowledgeable inspectors come from
about  countries

	There was an excelent article on the Feb   New Yorker on
why the IAEA fails to do its job

       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS
    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities aired on Tuesday
    April  For the sake of brevity I'll present them in some separate
    points

     As many other western programs this program was laid on a bed of
    misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the
    program on the viewer Some of the misinformations were as follows

     It was alleged that Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological
    advancements as antiIslamic but now things have changed and the proof of
    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers 
    These are the most ridiculous lies one can make about the objectives
    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology
    in Iran after revolution

    Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors
    while there has never been any proof in this regard and nobody has seen
    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons in
    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and
    civilians injured by Iraqi chemical weapons

     While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi
    aggression has been officially announced to be about  and even most
    radical counterrevolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total
    of one million dead this program claims that Iran alone has one million
    dead left from the war

     The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not  true For
    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that  It hurts me to
    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda The
    translator says  It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly
    research

     Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought
    by Iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to
    undermine their nonmilitary uses without any reference to Iran's
    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in
    near future and its current deficit in electrical power

     The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of
    Technology as a nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the
    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed
    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university Taking in account
    the scientific advancement of Sharif U in engineering fields and its
    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the
    lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries
    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones
    in scientific and industrial efforts

     A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA  in their numerous visits from
    Iran's different sites They say We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not  or  We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons

     As an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the
    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs
    William Triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking
    from the absolute knowledge

       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their
    country in western media and I hope Iranian authorities continue to
    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs
    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations

This show is just part of the American propaganda against any
government run by Muslims Iran Sudan Algeria remember democracy
Pakistan Palestine sorry Occupied Territories and many others
We must stop this idea that a government which does not fully
agree with American policies is not evil and dangerous as the media
attempts to portray it

Those who wish to learn something about the perversion of Judaism
should consult the masterly work by Yehoshua Harkabi who was many
years the head of Israeli Intelligence and an opponent of the PLO His
latest book was published in English and includes a very detailed analysis
of JudeoNazism

	You mean he talks about those Jews who because of their self
hatred spend all their time attacking Judaism Jews and Israel
using the most despicable of antiSemetic stereotypes

	I don't think we need to coin a term like JedeoNazism to
refer to those Jews who in their endless desire to be accepted by the
Nazis do their dirty work for them  We can just call them house
Jews fools or antiSemites from Jewish families

	I think house Jews a reference to a person of Jewish
ancestry who issues statements for a company or organization that
condemn Judaism is perfectly sufficeint  I think a few years free of
their antiSemetic role models would do wonders for most of them

Just a couple of questions for the proIsraeli lobby out there

 Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary  For Mr
Stein  I am working on a proof for you that Israel is diverting
water to the Jordan River away from Lebanese territory

 Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank Gaza and Golan
temporary  If so for those of you who support it why were so
many settlers moved into the territories  If it is not temporary
let's hear it

    points

Already say it the other week on CBC Snoozeworld

     Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought
    by Iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to
    undermine their nonmilitary uses without any reference to Iran's
    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in
    near future and its current deficit in electrical power


Why the hell would such an oil rich and hydroelectric potential to be
exploited spend billions on a nuclear energy programme

     For several reasons including

      With the current rate of growth of population and considering the
        million people who are already living there the oil reserves
       won't last for more than  years and after that Iran has to have
       other sources of energy

      Even with unlimited resources of oil it is the most wastefuls and
       foolish way to burn the oil just for thermal energy while thousands
       of valuable derivatives could be taken from oil For example I
       bought an iron for  here in Canada later I bought a garbage
       bucket for our kitchen for nearly  The bucket has been made
       from  petroleum products and I bet the producing country has not
       received even  cents for the amount of the oil used in that bucket
       while the western producer thank to the monopoly they have in
       technology and are trying to maintain it in all fields of science by
       methods you saw in that program makes billions of dollars every
       year

      Iran's hydropotential is something around  MW which won't be
       enough in less than  years Even exploiting this potential takes
       billions of dollars and so many years which can not catch up with
       the rate of growth in Iran's energy production

      More important than all above the science is not the belonging of any
       specific group or nation It is none of anybody's business if a nation
       want's to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes if that nation has
       accepted international monitoring something which Iran has done

     A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA  in their numerous visits from
    Iran's different sites They say We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not  or  We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons

Yeah and we have every reason in the world to trust the Iranian regime
After all they've been so forward with us in the past

      You can do whatever you want to But fair people of the world won't
  accept any of your screams when they see the constant observations
  of IAEA from Iranian sites and their constant rejection of the idea that
  Iran has a nuclear bomb production program

       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their
    country in western media and I hope Iranian authorities continue to
    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs
    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations

hahahahahahaahah

     Good sense of humor Since you have been sleeping during past few
  years I remind you to look at all Iran's neighbors from Kashmir and
  Afghanistan Tajikestan to Azerbaijan Armenia Georgia Iraq Lebanon
  Palestine boreder between Saudi Arabia and Qatar etc to see that only
  Iran is in calm and peaceful situation Also look at Iran's stance with
  regard to Iraqi occupation of Kuwait war between Armenia and Azerbaijan
  civil war in Afghanistan etc to understand what  wise and calculated
  approach is all about

   I'm surprised that you don't consider the acquisition of land by
   the Jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive
   state as a hostile action leading to war

	It was for the purpose of establishing a state not an
 exclusive state  If the state was to be exclusive it would not have
   arab citizens

Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of
Israel right after it was formed

	 Israeli citizens  The ethnic composition depends on what
you mean by formed  What the UN deeded to Israel  What it won in war

 	And no I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile
 action  When someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing
 to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce  It
 is not a hostile action leading to war

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity
Palestinians are no exception Perhaps you heard about
antitrust in the business world

	Were there antitrust laws in place in mandatory Palestine
Since the answer is no you're argument while interestingly
constructed is irrelevant  I will however respond to a few points
you assert in the course of talking about antitrust laws


They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews

	And those fleeing Arab lands where Jews were second class
citizens

Plus they paid fair market value etc

	Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land
they bought

They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy

	You know Sam when people start talking about an
International Jewish conspiracy its really begins to sound like
antiSemitic bull

	The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple
Zionists made no bones about what was going on  There were
conferences publications etc all talking about creating a National
home for the Jews

Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it
had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid
flowing

	Israel got no western aid in  nor in  or It
still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained  And how
is granting citizenship a facade

Don't get me wrong I beleive that Israel is democratic
within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group Jews

'bad' arabs Personaly I've never heard anything about the
arab community in Isreal Except that they're there  So
yes they're there But as a community with history and
roots its dead

	Because you've never heard of it its dead  The fact is you
claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of nonexistant
International aid  Then you see that that argument has a hole you
could drive a truck through and again assert that Israel is only
democratic within the unexplained constraints of one ethnic group
The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for
whoever they please  So please tell me Sam what constraints are
there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic
states

	I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab
population  Does that mean that they have no history or roots  When
I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel one of my neighbors was an
Israeli arab  He wasn't really all that different from my other
neighbors  Does that make him dead or oppressed


I stand corrected I meant that the jewish culture was not
predominant in Palestine in recent history I have no
problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were
predominantly Jewish So there what to make of the rest
Palestine

	How recent is recent  I can probably build a case for a
Jewish Gaza city  It would be pretty silly but I could do it  I'm
arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish but that land has no ethnicity

 WASHINGTON  A stark reminder of the Holocausta speech by Nazi
SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to the extermination of the
Jewish racewent on display Friday at the National Archives
	The documents including handwritten notes by Himmler are
among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the
Holocaust is a myth archivists say
	The notes give them their authenticity said Robert Wolfe
a supervisory archivist for captured German records  He was
supposed to destroy them  Like a lot of bosses he didn't obey his
own rules
	The documents moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped
would be a safe hiding place were recovered by Allied forces after
World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg Austria
	Himmler spoke on Oct  in Posen Poland to more than
 German secret police generals  I also want to talk to you
quite frankly on a very grave matter  Among ourselves it should be
mentioned quite frankly and yet we will never speak of it publicly
I mean the clearing out of the Jew the extermination of the Jewish
race  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been
written and is never to be written  Emphasis minerje
	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as
extermination is Ausrottung
	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be extirpation
or tearing up by the roots
	In his handwritten notes Himmler used a euphemism
Judenevakuierung or evacuation of the Jews  But archives
officials said extermination is the word he actually
spokepreserved on an audiotape in the archives
	Himmler who oversaw Adolf Hitler's final solution of the
Jewish question committed suicide after he was arrested in 
	The National Archives exhibit on display through May  is
a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum here on April 
	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of
Himmler's handwritten notes a typed transcript from the speech and
an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials

 Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary

	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave Lebanon when
the Lebanese government can provide guarantees that Israel will not be
attacked from Lebanese soil and when the Syrians leave


 Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank Gaza and Golan
temporary

	The three are very different issues  Israel has stated
repeatedly that it will not give up the whole Golan but may be
willing to give part of it to Syria as part of a peace agreement

	Israel has already annexed areas taken over in the  war
These areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no
legitamate governing body  Citizenship was given to those residents
in annexed areas who wanted citizenship

	Israel should keep control of parts of the West Bank IMHO
The parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge
which contain few arab towns and many suburbs as well as overlooking
the city of Tel Aviv  The Eastern mountain ridge should be
abandonded  This is where most of the arabs live and it is less
militarily relevant  Israel should also maintain a presence in the
Jordan valley

If so for those of you who support it why were so
many settlers moved into the territories  If it is not temporary
let's hear it

	There are a number of reasons for people to move they were
not moved but chose to move into disputed areas  Note that since
these moves were made by free willed human beings not settlers I
will address two aspects of your question why the government would
allow or encourage them to move and second why they did move

	The government had a number of reasons for encouraging people
to move across the green line  They included security and politics

	The first reason was security  A large Jewish presense makes
it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate  A Jewish settlements also
act as fortresses in times of war

	A second reason was political  Creating settlements brought
the arabs to the negotiation table  Had the creation of new towns and
cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in
Israel where there was an arab majority  There would have been no
land left that could be called arab

	The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place
changes the face of any peace settlement and restricts what land can
be given away

	Individuals who crossed the green line had several reasons for
doing so  They include financial religious and political reasons

	Many of the communities created were bedroom communities
Suburbs  A house  minutes outside of Tel Aviv cost half less if it
was on the wrong side of the green line  People who moved there
wanted a decent home at a nice price

	Some of the communites created were religious  They built
their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of
the 's and 's  There are communities like this in Hebron Gaza
and all over  There are also communities built near religious sites

	The last reason people moved was to establish a political
Jewish presense outside the green line  They built communities to
control important intersections important hilltops roads and other
places

	The point is there are many reasons people moved over the
green line and many reasons the government wanted them to  Whatever
status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all
or nothing deal  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not
be the results of a war

I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people It does
not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of
what happened in  where a vicious society run by fascist Armenians
decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse for wiping
out a peaceloving industrious and very intelligent and productive
ethnic group What we have is a demand from the fascist government of
xSoviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our
people And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and
not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century We
cannot reverse the events of the past but we can and we must strive to
keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because
of their religion or their race Which means that I support the claims
of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in xSoviet Armenia
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland

You can dream whatever you wish We have demands from the Armenians
With the Government of xSoviet Armenia we would sit down go over
all our outstanding issues whether it's land or reparations or
recognition whatever it is We'd like to sit down and ask for it
By all means lands and properties were taken away from us and they
should be returned to the rightful owners the Turkish and Kurdish
people who were there  years long before the Armenians ever
showed up in that area Entire population of the region was subjected
to genocide beyond belief genocide which was planned to exterminate
the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man woman and child
Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians To
assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings
was one of their methods Even today the traveler in that region is seldom
free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes

    Turkey must bare its teeth to Armenia

Sooner than you expect Remember 'Cyprus'

   I have to say I vehemently disagree with you I have seen

Too bad In fact by  Nazi Armenians in Europe had established
a vast network of proGerman collaborators that extended over two
continents Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and
WaffenSS in Russia and Western Europe Armenians were involved in
espionage and fifthcolumn activities for Hitler in the Balkans and
Arabian Peninsula They were promised an 'independent' state under
German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National
Council' A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional
Record' November   see Document  On this side of the Atlantic
Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance They had often
expressed proNazi sentiments until America entered the war In summary
during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and
cringing and fawning over the Nazis In that zeal the Armenian publication
in Germany Hairenik carried statements as follows

Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements the Jews
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease and when it
 becomes necessary for a people the Nazis to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method these attempts are regarded as revolutionary During the surgical
 operation the flow of blood is a natural thing

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews 
extracts from a letter dated December   published in the San
Francisco Chronicle as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B Amarian

 We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people JewsMembers of our family witnessed the
  murder of  members of our family near Erzurum Turkey by Armenian
  neighbors bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish
  andor Muslim Armenians should look to their own history and see
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war on his premise
  to grant them self government if in return the Armenians would
  help exterminate JewsArmenians were also hearty proponents of
  the antiSemitic acts in league with the Russian Communists Mr Amarian

Meeting The Armenian Reporter May   pp   

ATHENS Greece  An array of representatives of Greek political parties
including the ruling PASOK party and a host of political groups both
Armenian and nonArmenian joined to voice their solidarity with the
Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new
Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday April  during
the nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People And
judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these
political groups and organizations at least here in Greece the Armenian
Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world

The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of
the Armenian Popular Movement a comparatively new political force headed
by younger generations of Armenians who openly profess their support of the
armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia
ASALA The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern
countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to
have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks
of ASALA

Voicing the support of PASOK the ruling party in Greece to the Armenian
people was Mr Charalambidi Michalis a member of the Central Committee of
the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal
Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement
was Ara Sarkisian Significant was the address delivered by Mr Bassam
AbuSalim on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued
support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause
pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be
open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle Later Mr
AbuSalim answering a question put to him by this writer affirmed that
his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that
this policy will continue The doors of our camps are always open to
Armenian freedom fighters he affirmed

Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son
of Prime Minister Papandreou who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet
two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the
specific purpose of attending the international gathering representatives of
the Christian Democratic party EDIK Center party two wings of the Communist
party representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations
a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities two Greek members of the
European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among
those who participated in the international conference Also on hand to follow
the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens

More than significant was the large number of messages received by the
organizers including the following Palestinian National Revolutionary
Movement Fatah Popular Front for the Liberation of PalestineGeneral
Command the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation
MovementFatah the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon Arab Socialist
Labor Party the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq and numerous other
international groups all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli
Palestinian conflict

                 SUPPORT FROM ARFRM

Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary
FederationRevolutionary Movement the group that has claimed the abduction
and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to
foreign interests and powers The message clearly gave its support to the
Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will
continue to reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are
to expose the antiArmenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag Bureau
The message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be that
exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement
open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle

The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the
Greek capital known as Neos Kosmos where there is a large Armenian presence
The headquarters are located in a twostory building which appears to have
turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth who
prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves

Well it seems YOUR book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the
ncrap posted by Mr 

 o boy

 Please can you tell us why those quotes are crapbecause you do not
 like thembecause they really existwhy

 As I said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source
 given by Serdar Argic 

 You couldn't reject it


In addition the Author's Preface was written on January   BUT THE BOOK
was published in 

 Here we go again
 In the book I have both the front page and the Author's preface give
 the same year  and  January  respectively
 Anyone can check it at herhis libraryif not I can send you the copies of
 pages please ask by sct


I really don't care what year it was first published or 
What I care about is what the book writes about murders torturesetin
the given quotes by Serdar Argic and your denial of these quotesand your
groundless accussations etc




DD I can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim

VD what is new

I will post a gif file but I am not going go through the effort to show there
is some Turkish modified republication of the book like last time


 I claim I have a book in my hand published in first publication
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in Serdar Argic's Reference hasYou couldn't reject itbut now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around

 Let's see how you liefrom 'nonexisting' quotes to republication

 First you said there was no such a quote in the given referenceYou
 called Serdar Argic a liar
 I said to you NO MRDavidian there exactly existed such a quote
 I even gave the call number page numbersyou could't reject it

 And now you are lying again and talking about modifiedrepublished book
without any proof how when where by whom etc
 by the way how is it possible to republish the book in  if it was
  first published in your claimI am sure that you have some 'pretty
  well suited theories' as usual

 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and MrDavidian's liesI also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use which are
                  R 

  and the page numbers to verify the quotes and 




It is not possible that 's text has  pages mine has  and yours has


 Now are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying it is
 not possible If not what is your point

 Differences in the number of pages
 Mine was published in Serdar Argic's was in 
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter
 charachter in both publicationsetc etc does it give you an idea

 The issue was not the number of pages the book hasor the year
 first published
 And you tried to hide the whole point
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed torturedetc by Armeniansand those quotes given
 by Serdar Argic exist
 It was the issue wasn'tit

 you were not able to object itDoes it bother you anyway

 You name all these tortures and murders by Armenians as a crap
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many craps in the

In your and MutluArgicCosar's and thousands of others like you

'SDPAORG' criminalsNazis in action Your fascist government got away with
the genocide of  million Turkish men women and children and is enjoying
the fruits of that genocide And your criminal organization will not get away
with the genocide's coverup In June  a major uprising took place in
Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian The Moslem
districts were burnt down Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed
and hundreds of civilians also perished

   Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region which included
   the villages of Siner Simai GulliGuzat Ahi Hedenk Sinank
   Ekind Effard Musson Etek Akcesser Leaving their wives
   children and property in these inaccessible spots the Armenians
   joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan
   districts in the plain of Mus after which the whole body of
    men gathered in the Andok Mt Five or six hundred wished
   to surround Mus and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to
   the south of the city They slaughtered a number of the tribe and
   seized their goods The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell
   into their hands were derided and disparaged and the Muslims
   themselves murdered in the most frightful manner The rebels
   also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus but the
   large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from
   occupying the city

   The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts carrying out
   the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the
   neighbourhood They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive They
   raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'
   distance from GulliGuzat and then strangled them

   At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar
   Bekiran and Badikan tribes perpetrating equally horrible
   atrocities The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in
   the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the
   neighbourhood as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat

   Towards the end of August the Armenians attacked the
   Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four
   villages including GulliGuzat As for the  rebels in Talori
   they continued to spread death and destruction among the
   Muslims and other Christian communities refusing to lay down
   their arms

In his speech given at the Sivas Congress Mustafa Kemal once again drew
 a picture of the  country under occupation

 In the East the Armenians are making preparations for advancing to the
 River Halys Kizilirmak and have already started a policy of massacring
 the Moslem population


pp 

The situation of the southern provinces of Turkey after the signing of the
 Mudros Armistice is described by Ataturk in his speech

 The Armenians in the south armed by foreign troops and encouraged by the
 protection they enjoyed molested the Mohammedans of their district They
 pursued a relentless policy of murder and extinction everywhere This was
 responsible for the tragic incident at Marasthe Armenians had completely
 destroyed an old Mohammedan town like Maras by their artillery and
 machinegun fire

 They killed thousands of innocent and defenceless women and children The
 Armenians were the instigators of the atrocities which were unique in
 history

It is appropriate to add what Himmler said other inferior races
and human animals in his speech at Posen and elsewhere


From the speech of ReichsfuehrerSS Himmler before SS
MajorGenerals Posen October  
Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression Vol IV p 

One basic principal must be the absolute rule for the SS man we
must be honest decent loyal and comradely to members of our own
blood and to nobody else What happens to a Russian to a Czech
does not interest me in the slightest What the nations can offer
in good blood of our type we will take if necessary by kidnapping
their children and raising them with us Whether nations live in
prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we
need them as slaves for our culture otherwise it is of no interest
to me Whether  Russian females fall down from exhaustion
while digging an antitank ditch interest me only in so far as
the antitank ditch for Germany is finished We shall never be rough
and heartless when it is not necessary that is clear We Germans
who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude
towards animals will also assume a decent attitude towards these
human animals But it is a crime against our own blood to worry
about them and give them ideals thus causing our sons and
grandsons to have a more difficult time with them When someone
comes to me and says I cannot dig the antitank ditch with women
and children it is inhuman for it will kill them then I
would have to say you are a murderer of your own blood because
if the antitank ditch is not dug German soldiers will die and
they are the sons of German mothers They are our own blood



Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades September  
Trials of Wa Criminals Vol IV p 

If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman and by this
I mean sexual intercourse then the man will be hanged right in
front of his camp Then the others will not do it Besides
provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women
and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this
kind is out of the question

The women will be brought before the courts without mercy and
where the facts are not sufficiently proved  such borderline
cases always happen  they will be sent to a concentration camp
This we must do unless these one million Poles and those
hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict
untold damage on the German blood Philosophizing is of no avail
in this case It would be better if we did not have them at all 
we all know that  but we need them

Just a couple of questions for the proIsraeli lobby out there

 Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary  For Mr
Stein  I am working on a proof for you that Israel is diverting
water to the Jordan River away from Lebanese territory

Israel has made it quite clear that it has absolutely no desire to
keep any Lebanese territory and will leave completely after a peace
treaty is signed and Lebanon gains control of its own country from
Syria and controls the terrorists launching strikes against Israel
from Lebanon

Considering this it obviously would be pointless for Israel to be
working on diverting water away from Lebanese territory

 Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank Gaza and Golan
temporary  If so for those of you who support it why were so
many settlers moved into the territories  If it is not temporary
let's hear it

Who gets to keep what parts of Judea and Samaria will be determined in
a peace settlement  Obviously Israel will keep some and the Arabs
will get some

Israel has tried to get out of Gaza almost from the time it got stuck
with it  It has been refused by the Arabs several times  Although
there are some Israelis who are extremely reluctant to give it up I
seriously doubt Israel will keep more than a tiny portion of it in any
settlement

The Golan Heights is a serious security problem and Israel obviously
will have to keep part of it and give up part of it  One should
remember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was to
be in Britain's Palestine Mandate slated to become part of the Jewish
state until Britain traded it to France for other considerations  In
other words it is an historical accident that it was ever part of
Syria

What the hell do you know about Israeli policy  What gives you the fiat
to look into the minds of Israeli generals  Has this 'policy of intimidation'
been published somewhere  For your information the actions taken by Arabs
specifically the PLO were not uncommon in the Lebanon Campaign of   My
brain is full of shit  At least I don't look into the minds of others and
make Israeli policy for them

 deleted

I am not in the business of reading minds however in this case it would not
be necessary  Israelis top leaders in the past and present always come across
as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs

How would you deal with Arabs who ALWAYS threaten to drive you into the sea or
burn half your conuntry  Would you talk nicely  Would you say please  You
wouldn't  The language of the middle east is power and force  Sorry  that
is the way it is now  If you aren't strong you go down  Israel has to talk
and act tough  Notice Israel talks and acts tough in battle but is willing
to talk peace

The way I see it Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace
after almost  years of fighting because of the following two major reasons

  Arab governments are not really representative of their people currently
    most of their leaders are stupid andor not independent andor
    dictators

True  and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort
of monsters  Arab nonrecognition of Israel and support of war and terror
is also an important factor wouldn't you say

  Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising

What do you want Israel to do  They are negotating I'm sick of people calling
for Israel to withdraw from the territories now  That's not realistic don't
you realize that  A solution must be negotiated  It is on the table  Have
patience

Actually this is incorrect  French resistance may have played some

supplied on DDay

 Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the

Interesting statement  Especially when you consider that Lebanon
had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks as well as
Israel  Of course one of the prime obstacles to Israel's complete
withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied
to the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which
have not been asked to withdraw as well

 I have nothing against Greeks but my problem is with fanatics I have met
 so many Greeks who wouldn't even talk to me because I am Turkish From my
 experience all my friends always were open to Greeks

  Well the history wars current situations all of them do not help

Well Panos Mr Tamamidis the way you put it it is only the Turks
who bear the responsibility of the things happening today That is hard to
believe for somebody trying to be objective

 Well if you put things into historical perspective the Turks
 moved into an area which was inhabited by Greeks  This is how the history
 between the two nations started some centuries ago  Since then it has been
 a continuous battle between the two nations  From my perspective I can't see
 why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened
 between the two nations  Of course it would not be reasonable to argue that
 the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area  This isn't
 going to happen so the best would be to improve the relations between the two
 countries  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus  If things can't work
 there there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations

When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides
What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW anyway
Do you think it was your right to be there

 I always avoid to discuss such things  I consider it a waist of my time
 Besides as I said I do not want to open a new flame

I am not saying that conflicts started with that It is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
It is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey I thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better

 I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists
 I bet that this week there should be about  tourists from Greece
 in Turkey  Each one will leave at least  so go and figure what this
 means to your economy  If you had kept the visa requirement how many
 Greeks would bother to visit Turkey

The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
people They have never met me but they know I am bad person
because I am from Turkey Politics is not my business and it is
not the business of most of the Turks When it comes to individuals
why the hatred

 Come on Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience  You err
 if you think you'd get a reasonable conclusion

Armenia is not counting on Iranian help As far as violations of international

And who do you speak for Rafsanjani

FARID The Azerbaijanis of Iran will be the guarantors of this policy As for
FARID scaring Iranians or Turks from the Russian power experts on present

Well Farid your supposed experts are not expert The Russians have had

Hmm that makes it    years

Oh I see the Azeris from Iran are going to force out the Armenians from
Karabakh That will be a real good trick

FARID Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb
FARID and a reliable delivery system refer to recent news releases
FARID regarding the potential of Iran

So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by
forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians

FARID The moral of the story is that you don't go invading your neighbor's

Oh but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor You are
a damn fool Farid

FARID Marshal Shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding Turkey in a

So you are going to drop an atomic bomb on Russia as well

FARID Peaceful resolution of the ArmenianAzerbaijani conflict is the only
FARID way to go Armenia may soon find the fruits of Aggression very bitter

any concentrationlabor camp in Turkey around  or
later for Cypriot Greeks or any Greeks rather than talking
nonsense like above I will be glad to read what they got

How can you be in a position to know about any kind of concentration camps
Akgun

Living through those days at the age of  and following
the internal and external news gives me that knowledge
and position  In  Turkey had a democratic goverment and free
press at that time  Forget about internal news agencies I haven't
heard anything from any international source about any
concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey
However I heard Adana POW camp  It was not secret and well
recognized POW camp

As for all the registered prisoners to the Red Cross having returned to
their homes this is your version of the story  There are cases in which
prisoners who were registered some of them even sent messages to their
relatives were not released  These are undeniable facts

I see  They vanished in Turkish labor camps  Turks have
decided to acknowledge their existence first but later
changed their minds releasing them  Is that it  What do
you think happened to them  I thought that MIA's are only the subject
of Rambo and Chuck Noris movies  Seems that I am wrong


As for their treatment being according to what convention
Okay we believe you

You don't need to belive me  Turkiye was never a clandestine state
in its history  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN
since the inception of UN  No body ever questioned the UN membership of
Turkey because of what had happened in a and after  Only a short
lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the
internal Greek loby  I know what you would say next  Let me answer it
before wasting anytime  Yes  UN had a few condemning resolutions
against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem especially after
the  coup  Well US and Israel had a few too  What can I say
I am sure during Athens Junta duruing  Greeks had
their own share too

closed matter today between Turkish CypriotsTurksGreeksGreek
Cypriots  There is no more any official demand from Greek
Cypriots about any missing Greek Cypriots

Where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the
missing persons

Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks
mediated by Gali  There was no issue whatsoever about any
missing people among the negotiating parties  was there
I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and
International press  He keeps saying that This was no
longer an issue for peace talks  Also you don't want
me fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words that Argic
had posted zillion times describing missing peoples as
a GreekCypriot myth  Seems that there is a different opinions
among GreekCypriots as well about missing people in Turkish
custody



Your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed
in the period between the coup d'eta and the invasion  days is simply
not true  All the cases of missing persons I know and I know quite a
few are cases of people who were  either in the reserve forces and were lost
somewhere in the battlefield or were civilians who were taken prisoners
in their villages by the turkish army

I am not claiming anything  I just told you what was
given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish
GovermentTurkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some
of their own between July  and the final ceasefire in
late August   This answer seems to satisfy the international
community the UN and the Vasilu Goverment since he did not make it
an issue for the peace talks  Also I am not aware of any UN
condemnation against Turkey about any missing GreekCypriot  Are you

BTW do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta
and nobody got hurt in those events


As of the few photos which you refer to there are more than a few There are
photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being rounded up but also others
in the prison camp in Turkey

Like I said before  There is even a different opinion among
GreekCypriots for this myth   The officers in Turkish Army who
governed the Adana POW camp must be hell of clever dudes
to cover up their tracks   I hope Turkish Army does't have

a good subject for a movie script  One should inform Oliver Stone
about this


 Of course not  The justice was served well  If and when the Bosnian
pleas are answered who's going to dare to ask what happens to those
masterminds behind the ethnic cleansing idea  They are known today
as EOKAB masterminds were known in  to everybody and are doing
it openly even giving TV interviews  It may take same time as it was
for the EOKAB case however the justice will be served again

Akgun comparing the actions of the Serbians in Bosnian with the

actions of

Turkey in Cyprus is not something I would do if I were a Turk

I thought
that the Serbians were the savages the inhumane beasts etc etc

OK I should inform mine

I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions even though they were
not addressed to me specifically but I feel that I am a bit concerned
by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is
often on the receiving end of Israel's bombs
In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied
Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder  It is
disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich
or any other act of terrorism or mrder  This exercise is aimed
solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth
It seems to me Dorin that you are so remote and ignorant of the problem
on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant
and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation
I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of
what the situation really is in South Lebanon

In article Aprunocalcom stssdxbstunocalcom Dorin Baru writes

 Is there any Israeli a civilian in your opinion 

 Now I do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of villages
 But you claim these are villages with civilians and Iraelis claim they are
 camps filled with terrorists You claim that israelis shell the villages with the
 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so If they kill one fine if not too bad
 civilians die right  I am not so sure

I am  I was back in my home village this last summer  For your information
we are PEOPLE not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists  Most of the
people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily
business some work in the fields some own small shops others are
older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee  Is that so hard to
imagine   It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like
to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc
SOME young men usually aged between  to  years are members of
the Lebanese resistance  Even the inhabitants of the village do not
know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often
suspect who they are and what they are up to  These young men are
supported financially by Iran most of the time  They sneak arms and
ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
for Israeli patrols  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians  Once they
are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist  hideout where
an  year old girl just happened to be
We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics and we figure that this is
the Israeli way of telling us that if you're gonna hurt our soldiers
you're gonna pay the price  We accept this as a price we have to pay
to free our land Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting
the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather
just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young
men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are
taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers
Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that
we have come to accept and deal with the Lebanese Resistance
on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING
ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw this is the only real
leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw
The people of South Lebanon are occupied or shelled by Israel on a
regular basis  We do not want to be occupied  If Israel insists that
the so called Security Zone is necessary for the protection of
Northern Israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation
with the blood of its soldiers  If Israel is interested in peace
than it should withdraw from OUR land  We are not asking for the
establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect
our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel so the
best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the
establishment of peace keeping troops along the border

I have written before on this very newsgroup that the only
real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace
settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and
peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure
no one on either side of the border is shelled
This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to
realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting
its northern cities has failed  In fact it has caused much more
Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
would have resulted in
If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw
unilaterally from the socalled Security Zone before the conclusion
of the peace talks  Such a move would save Israeli lives
advance peace efforts give Israel a great moral lift better Israel's
public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations
since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in
peace and has already offered some important concessions
Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah
be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not
accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a
shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone
and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it
There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such
circumstances and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
in all other parts of Lebanon

 If you ask me those questions I will have no problem answering not with a
 question as you did  No NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder nothing
 justifies murder

I agree only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing
CANNOT be qualified as murder no matter what you say

 I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make
 similar statements maybe after eliminating all Israelis jews  Am I wrong 

Yes we have no quarrel with Jews or Israeli civilians
The real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave
Israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an
occupying soldier is attacked

Hezbollah and other Lebanese Resistance fighters are skilled at precision
bombing of SLA and Israeli targets

It's hard to beat a carbomb with a suicidal driver in getting
right up to the target before blowing up  Even boobytraps and
radiocontrolled bombs under cars are pretty efficient killers
You have a point

I find such methods to be far more
restrained and responsible

Is this part of your Islamic valuesystem

than the Israeli method of shelling and bombing
villages with the hope that a Hezbollah member will be killed along with
the civilians murdered

Had Israeli methods been anything like this then Iraq wouldn've been
nuked long ago entire Arab towns deported and executions performed by
the tens of thousands  The fact is though that Israeli methods
aren't even th as evil as those which are common and everyday
in Arab states

Soldiers are trained to die for their country Three IDF soldiers
did their duty the other day These men need not have died if their government
had kept them on Israeli soil

Agressive actions are taken by both sides Tough talk is done by both sides
When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk
I think And killing people is mildly agressive justified in your opinion
if they are israeli soldiers justified in others' opinion if they are jews not
justified at all in others opinion

When Brad wrote the article about  Israelis killed ther was a lot of pride
and satisfaction in his lines That's what I feel disgusting We may agree
or not when a killing is 'technically' murder but being enthousiastic about it


And again I may appreciate some of your points but you are not objective That
is not a blame just a remark

Let's not forget that Yoni Netanyahu died while freeing civilian
hostages from PLO terrorists who had hijacked a passenger airliner to
Uganda  Mrs Dora Bloch apparently died in Uganda though I don't

that both Rabin and Netanyahu refuse to negotiate with  This should

IMHO it does not really matter who started any individual battle within
the ArabsIsreal war context The real question is whowhat  started the
War Does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of Israel on Arab
land 
	Huh  A war was started when several armies invaded Israel
vowing to drive the Jews into the sea  Most Jews wanted to live in
peace and the Arabs who stayed in Israel were granted citizenship

 I am
surprised that you don't consider the acquisition of land by
the Jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive
state as a hostile action leading to war

	It was for the purpose of establishing a state not an
exclusive state  If the state was to be exclusive it would not have
  arab citizens

	And no I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile
action  When someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing
to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce  It
is not a hostile action leading to war

As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace maybe
However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish
state where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of
the land  Living in peace is meaningless unless it means
living WITH someone else as equal For a native arab this
does not leave many options

	Oh you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens  The
arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who
they vote for as the Jews

Those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what
happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless
and ineffective minority
If I were wrong you'd have Israel recall all the
palestinian refugees we're talking millions After all
they are civilians

	Huh  The people who left did so voluntarily  There is no
reason for Israel to let them in

Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it
had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid
flowing

	Israel got no western aid in  nor in  or It
still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained  And how
is granting citizenship a facade

	Tell me something Sam  What makes land arab

How shall I explain Its a contract between the man and the
land  Control isn't it The Ottomans ruled  years and
then left with barely a trace  The concept of Land identity
is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic West  It is
partly the concept of 'le sol natal' native soil  I know
that jews had previous history in the region but none in
recent memory  I'm talking everyday life not archeology

	Try again you tell me what its isn't but you fail to
establish what it is

	Also Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand
years  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel
There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 
Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from  or so onwards  Does that

Perhaps though one can argue about whether or not the current
Palestinian delegation represents the PLO I would hope it does not as
the PLO really doesn't have that kind of legitimacy

Does it matter to you Naftaly Adam and others that Arafat
advises the delegation and that the PLO overall supports it  Does
it also matter that Arafat on behalf of the PLO recognizes Israel
and its right to exist  Further does Israel's new policy concerning
direct negotiations with the PLO hold any substance to the situation
as a whole

No he does not  Arafat explicitly denies this claim


from a Libyan televison interview with Yasser Arafat 
Q Some people say that the Palestinian revolution has many times changed
   its strategies and tactics something which has left its imprint on the
   Palestinian problem and on the Palestinian Liberation Front  The
   strategies and tactics have not been clear  The question is is the
   direction of the Palestinian problem clear  The Palestinian leadership
   has stopped or at least this is what has been said in the media this
   happened on the way to the dialogue with the United States the PLO
   recognized something called Israel

A No no no  We do not recognize the State of Israel  We said
   recognition  when a Palestinian state is established  It will then
   decide if to recognize Israel or not  When it is established its
   parliament will convene and decide

policies which it can justify through occupation  Because of this
you have the grassroot movements that reject Israel's authority and
disregard for human rights and if Israel was serious about peace it
would abandon these policies

	And replace them with what  If Israel is to withdraw its
control of any territory there must be two prerequsites  One is that
it leads to a reduction in deaths  The second is that it should not
weaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks

	Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages
arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews  The only
way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations
These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with
security guarantees for both sides

	Until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again
they should not expect or recieve more concessions

One of my biggest complaints about using the word fundamentalist
is that at least in the USA people speak of muslime
fundamentalists                                  muslim
but nobody defines what a jewish or christan fundamentalist is
I wonder what an equal definition would be
any takers

	The American press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to
refer to both Christians and Jews  Christian fundementalists are
often refered to in the context of antiabortion protests  The
American media also uses fundamentalist to refer to Jews who live in
Judea Samaria or Gaza and to any Jew who follows the torah

With regards to my condemnation of Marc's ridiculous attacks on the
American Department of Justice and further attacks on Jews to
anyone who took offense to my calling Marc stupid I
apologize for pointing out the obvious  It was a waste of the
Net's time  I hope though that most American citizens have
the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to
understand the relationship between the Justice Department
as a part of the Executive Branch and the Courts which
are of the Judicial Branch
Marc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his
inability to comprehend and interpret foreign affairs


Peace

Now if actions of the lebanese resistance help send the
Isrealis packing I'm all for it If you are really
concerned about bloodshed a little self criticism could do
you a great favor

	One of these days you'll learn that the way to stop Israel
from fighting back is to stop attacking  If there were no attacks in
the security zone for a year because the Lebanese army could maintain
the peace then Lebanon would be in much better shape

	Tell me something though  Why do Syrian troops not get
attacked  Aren't they occupying Lebanon

	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave on two
conditions  One is a demonstration that the Lebanese army can keep
the peace  The second is that the Syrians pull out as well

resistance fighters Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the
Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the
hostile occupiers in WWII

	And all this time I thought it was the US  Britian invading
Normandy the constant round the clock bombing and the fact that the
Germans were fighting on two fronts  How silly of me  

	This is not to devalue the actions of the resistance
movements but resistance movements did not defeat the Nazis

Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the
Lebanese people are tired of being occupied They are now turning to the
only option they see as viable Don't forget that it worked in driving
out the US

	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave when the
Lebanese government shows that it can prevent attacks on Israel and
when the Syrians agree to leave

	The Lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long or maybe
they're not capable of getting rid of the Syrians and Iranians who
occupy their land  If they closed down the Hezbolah and negotiated a
withdrawl of Syrian forces Israel would be happy to leave

we have come to accept and deal with the Lebanese Resistance

leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw

	Tell me do these young men also attack Syrian troops


with the blood of its soldiers  If Israel is interested in peace
than it should withdraw from OUR land

	There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens  It
seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain
themselves from violence and unable to to realize that their actions
prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon

	If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace then
Israel would not have to be there  Until it is Israel prefers that
its soldiers die rather than its children


If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw
unilaterally from the socalled Security Zone before the conclusion
of the peace talks  Such a move would save Israeli lives
advance peace efforts give Israel a great moral lift better Israel's
public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations
since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in
peace and has already offered some important concessions

	Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is
signed  Not a day before  Withdraw because of casualties would tell
the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is
kill a few soldiers  Its not gonna happen

Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah
be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not
accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a
shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone
and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it


	Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer
zone  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while
holding your neighbors land  If Lebanon were willing to agree to
those conditions Israel would quite probably have left already
Unfortunately it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the
Hizbolah and maintain the peace

It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like
to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc
SOME young men usually aged between  to  years are members of
the Lebanese resistance  Even the inhabitants of the village do not
know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often
suspect who they are and what they are up to  These young men are
supported financially by Iran most of the time  They sneak arms and
ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
for Israeli patrols  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians

This a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups
to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the
opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or
in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search Certainly the
people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the
innocent civilians into harm's way

Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover Israel
should totally back down Sothe easiest way to get away with attacking
another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
innocent lives

If Israel insists that
the so called Security Zone is necessary for the protection of
Northern Israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation
with the blood of its soldiers

Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of demilitarized or buffer
zone Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory
of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing It is not exactly
surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to
do it themselves

If Israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from OUR land

What So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states
can start all over again While I also hope for this to happen it will
only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are prepared to take on the
responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their
soil They have to Prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way
Israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of
tolerance towards antiIsrael guerillas inresidence

I have written before on this very newsgroup that the only
real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace
settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and
peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure
no one on either side of the border is shelled

Good lord Brad What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop
anything They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows
them in It can ask them to leave at any time as Nasser did in ' and
' Somehow with that limitation on the troops powers I don't
think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable Without a genuine commitment to peace from the Arab states and concrete not intellectual or political exercises in jargon guarantees by other parties the UN is worthless
to Israel but perhaps useful as a ruse

This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to
realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting
its northern cities has failed  In fact it has caused much more
Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
would have resulted in

Perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is
the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting
against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently
accept our fate Ifhowever you call on Israel to see the sense of
suffering fewer casualties I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian
Arab and Islamic groups

If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw
unilaterally from the socalled Security Zone before the conclusion
of the peace talks  Such a move would save Israeli lives
advance peace efforts give Israel a great moral lift better Israel's
public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations
since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in

Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah
be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not
accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a
shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone
and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it

From Israel's perspective concessions gets it NOTHINGexcept the
realization that it has given something up and now can only
hope that the other side decides to do likewise Words can be taken
back by merely doing so to take back tangible items land
control of land requires the sort of action you say Israel should
stay away from

Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades
before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon
The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above  Israel
would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state
involved  that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure
in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts
committed by private groups  Israel would prepare for the next
round of attacks What would Israel want to return to those days and
don't be so idiotic as to suggest trust for the motivations of
presentday Arab states

There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such
circumstances

Ah okwhat is different about the present situation that tells
us that the Arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic
policies towards Israel Now don't talk about vague political factors
but about those tangible just like that which Israel gave up
factors that guarantee the responsibility of those states Your
assessment of difference here is based on a whole lot of assumptions
and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that
sort of thing

and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
in all other parts of Lebanon

Basil

It has not Without the support and active involvement of Syria
Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred
Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain
control If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel

Tim

Your view of this entire matter is far too serenely onesided and
selectively naive

   In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied
   Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder  It is
   disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich
   or any other act of terrorism or mrder  This exercise is aimed
   solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth

I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc is
not terrorism  That having been said lets continue

   snip
   imagine   It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like
   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
   in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc

I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are terrorist
camps  There are however some which come very close to serving that
purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way
prior to the invasion

   SOME young men usually aged between  to  years are members of
   the Lebanese resistance  Even the inhabitants of the village do not
   know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often
   suspect who they are and what they are up to  These young men are
   supported financially by Iran most of the time  They sneak arms and
   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
   for Israeli patrols  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
   by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians  Once they
   are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist  hideout where
   an  year old girl just happened to be

Some of the villages and yours might well be among them are as you
describe  Not all are  There are a large number of groups in the area
backed by various organizations with a wide range of purposes  Hizbollah
and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be  As to retaliation
while mistakes may be made that is still a far cry from indiscriminate
bombing which would have produced major casualties

   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that
   we have come to accept and deal with the Lebanese Resistance
   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING
   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw this is the only real
   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw

Well here we disagree  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if
the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police
it and prevent further attacks

   This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to
   realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting
   its northern cities has failed  In fact it has caused much more
   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
   would have resulted in

Actually that is not clear at all  I will agree that the death toll is no
longer civilian and now primarily military though

   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such
   circumstances and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
   in all other parts of Lebanon

No the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another
Lebanese morass  I could elaborate if necessary

   I agree only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing
   CANNOT be qualified as murder no matter what you say

No but it is regretable as is the whole situation

Excuse me

 We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as
  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work
  of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village
  Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts
  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable
  and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets
  completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They
  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border
  into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole
  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to
  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain
  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of
  Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for
  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the
  scattered bones of the dead

A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an
attempt to exterminate a race This is the worst crime in history
It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian
dictatorship  million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst
ways imaginable It is sickening to think that the human race is capable
of such actions but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian
genocide of  million Muslims happened

People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were
killed in the Turkish genocide I understand their anger that there
are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place
despite the fact that the genocide of  million Turks has been
well documented over the past six decades We cannot reverse
the events of the past but we can and we must strive to keep the
memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people
because of their religion or their race

        to Bradley Letter of September  

I have it from absolute firsthand information that the Armenians in
 the Caucasus attacked Tartar Turkish villages that are utterly
 defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder
 the inhabitants pillage the village and often burn the village

	Lets get somethings straight

Why not

	Armenians are no angels but they were subject to Turkish genocide

And the Germans were subject to Jewish Genocide Are you for real
Tell me 'Halsall' were you high on ASALASDPAARF forgeries and
fabrications when you wrote that Where is your nonexistent list
of scholars Here is mine During the First World War and the ensuing
years   the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated
and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuriesold policy
of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering
 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their  year
homeland

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the th Century acted upon an entire people

  Mark Alan Epstein 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role
  in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries' Klaus Schwarz Werlag
  Freiburg 

  page 

 During the fifteenth century when the Ottomans were struggling to
  reestablish themselves in the Balkans there was considerable turmoil
  among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe Even if
  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the
  fourteenth are minimized it is easy to understand the attraction which
  Ottoman life particularly when compared to life in Europe held for the
  Jews There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the
  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans but with each account of persecution
  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews
  fled to Ottoman territory The regularity of these reports suggests that
  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that
  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and
  eastward from Western and Central Europe  It is evident that the
  effects of plague late crusades and the general intolerance and
  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection
  of the whole focus of Jewish life which for more than two centuries
  was to be oriented toward Muslim East


  page 

  In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official
  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi
  Chief Rabbi of the city He was the most important rabbi in the city and
  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation
  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century Sarfati himself was from
  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two
  recent arrivals from there who upon seeing the prosperity and freedom
  of the Ottoman Jews prevailed upon him to write their European
  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate
  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant
  conditions in the Ottoman domains but described as well the ease of
  travel to Palestine and the holy places an attraction to those who
  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there 


  page 

 the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were
 firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them
 and the Ottomans especially in comparison to relations with the Christians
 of Europe

 Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is
 also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews
 as allies of Islam and were well aware of MuslimJewish cooperation
 Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians
 representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed European
 sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers In addition
 it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews''  their
 sworn enemies and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who
 regularly reported to the Ottomans

 There are wellknown examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans
 in the struggle against European powers The two best known instances
 of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited
 instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda in the
 early sixteenth century and of Rhodes We also have reports of sympathy
 for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios An unpublished Ottoman
 document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some
 Greek towns

 page 

  It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally
 accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently
 and all parties involved Jews Muslims and Christians were aware of
 the situation


 page 

 it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not
 particularly cordial The two groups had little in common few common
 interests and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition
 which could serve as the basis for cooperation rather than enmity If
 there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between
 religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was
 that between Muslims and Jews neither of whom had much in common with
 the Orthodox

 page 

 The general impression of MuslimJewish relations in the Ottoman context
 during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of
 interests From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed
 Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already
 existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element The Jewish
 response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian
 countries to Ottoman domains

 page 

  From the period before  we have only a few indications that the
  OttomanJewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would
  characterize it for years afterward but the liberality of the Ottomans
  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines and the protection and
  the security which the Ottomans offered in comparison to conditions
  elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the
  Jews recognized their mutual interests

  page 

  It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success
  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success
  in the sixteenth century That they played an important role in both
  cannot be doupted It is also unclear whether they were important enough
  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success
  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve
  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews It is however unmistakably clear
  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable
  partnership between Jews and the nonJewish society in which they lived
  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their
  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the
  Jews did Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home


 A version of Rabbi Sarfati's Tzarfati letter is given by ProfShaw

  page 

  Your cries and sobs reached us We have been told of all the troubles
  and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German landsI hear
  the lamentation of my brethrenThe barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly
  oppresses the faithful children of the chosen peopleThe priests and
  prelates of Rome have risen They wish to root out the memory of Jacob
  and erase the name of Israel They always devise new persecutions They
  wish to bring you to the stakeListen my brethren to the counsel I will
  give you I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German
  rabbis I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land
  which is blessed by God and filled with all good things Here I found rest
  and happiness Turkey can also become for you the land of peaceIf you
  who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with
  in this land you would not consider any difficulties you would set out
  to come to usHere in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain
  of We possess great fortunes much gold and silver in our hands We are
  not oppressed with heavy taxes and our commerce is free and unhindered
  Rich are the fruits of the earth Everything is cheap and every one of us
  lives in peace and freedom Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow
  hat as a badge of shame as is the case in Germany where even wealth and
  great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy
  among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him
  to rob him of his gold Arise my brethren gird up your loins collect
  your forces and come to us Here you will be free of your enemies here
  you will find rest

My personal problem with Romanian culture is that I am
not aware of one There is an anecdote about Armenians

Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level
The imageconscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in
their background Armenians have never achieved statehood and
independence they have always been subservient and engaged
in undermining schemes against their rulers They committed
genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia
and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and
fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry
during World War II Belligerence genocide backstabbing
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the
Armenian history To obliterate these episodes the Armenians
engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims In this zeal
they tried to cover up the coldblooded genocide of  million
Turks and Kurds before and during World War I

And you don't pull nations out of a hat

This generally proArmenian work contains the following information
of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust

a Dro the butcher the former Dictator of the Armenian Dictatorship and
the architect of the Genocide of  million Turks and Kurds the most
respected of Nazi Armenian leaders established an Armenian Provisional
Republic in Berlin during World War II

b this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social
theories of the Nazis declared themselves and all Armenians to be members
of the Aryan 'SuperRace'

What about Cyprus The majority of the population is christian but
your fellow Turkish friends DID and STILL DOING a 'good' job for you
by cleaning the area from christians

All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance The people of
Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never
abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally
hopeful of uniting it with Greece someday whatever the cost to the
parties involved The history speaks for itself Greece was the sole
perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July
  in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop
Makarios

Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with
the aid of the Greek army Turkiye intervened by using her legal right
given by two international agreements Turkiye did it for the frequently
and conveniently forgotten people of the island Turkish Cypriots For
those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island
since 

The release of Nikos Sampson a member of EOKA National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters and a convicted terrorist shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece Of
course the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences
for this irresponsible conduct


            THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM

 Irfan Bey Street Kumsal Area Nicosia Cyprus

It is the  house of Dr Nihat  Ilhan a major who  was serving at
the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent During  the attacks launched
against the Turks by the Greeks on th December  Dr Nihat
Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally
killed in the  bathroom where they had tried to  hide by savage
Greeks Dr  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night the
th   December     Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities
committed during and after  are exhibited in this house which
has been converted into a museum

AN EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY
GREEK TERRORISTS

The date  is the th of  December  The onslaught  of the
Greeks against the Turks which  started three days ago has been
going on  with all its  ferocity and defenseless women  old men
and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks And now Kumsal
Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage
bloodshed

The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr Nihat  Ilhan a
major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent
are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the
bathroom of their house by  maddened Greeks who broke into their
home A glaring example of Greek barbarism

Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by
Mr Hasan  Yusuf Gudum an  eye witness who himself  was wounded
during the same terrible event

On the night of the th  of December  my wife Feride Hasan
and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr Nihat Ilhan
Our neighbours  Mrs Ayshe of  Mora her daughter Ishin  and Mrs
Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us  We were  all sitting
having supper  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River
direction started to riddle the  house sounding like heavy rain
Thinking  that   the  diningroom  where  we   were  sitting  was
dangerous we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought
would be  safer Altogether we were  nine persons We all  hid in
the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet We
waited in fear Mrs Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor was standing
in the bath with her three children Murat Kutsi and Hakan in her
arms Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open
Greeks had  come in and were  combing every corner of  the house
with  their machine  gun bullets  During these  moments I  heard
voices saying in  Greek You want Taksim eh  and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom Mrs Ilhan and her three children
fell into  the bath They were  shot At this moment  the Greeks
who broke  into the bathroom emptied  their guns on us  again I
heard one of the Major's children moan then I fainted

When I came  to myself  or   hours later I saw  Mrs Ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the  bath I and the rest of the
neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded But what
had happened to my wife Then I remembered and immediately ran to
the  toilet where  in  the doorway  I saw  her  body She  was
brutally murdered

In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying
Help help Is  there no one to save us  I became terrified I
thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not
dead they would kill  me So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself
under the doublebed

An our  passed by In the  distance I could still  hear shots My
mouth was dry  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some
water Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the
bathroom which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago There I
offered sweets  to Mrs Ayshe  her daughter and Mrs  Novber who
were all wounded

We  waited in  the bathroom  until   o'clock in  the morning  I
thought morning would never come  We were all wounded and needed
to be taken  to hospital Finally as we could  walk Mrs Novber
and I went  out into the street hoping to  find help and walked
as far as Koshklu Chiftlik

There we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were
operated on When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there
were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs
Ayshe and her daughter

After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to
Ankara  for  further treatment  There  I  have had  four  months
treatment but still I cannot use  my arm On my return to Cyprus
Greeks arrested me at the Airport

All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my
detention They then released me

ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER

We went tonight into the sealedoff Turkish quarter of Nicosia in
which   to  people have  been slaughtered in the  last five
days

We  were the  first  Western  reporters there  and  we saw  some
terrible sights

In the Kumsal quarter at No  Irfan Bey Sokagi we made our way
into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass  A
child's bicycle lay in a corner

In the  bathroom looking  like a group  of waxworks  were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother

In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the
head

This we  were told was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence

Today was five days later and still they lay there

 AN APPALLING SIGHT

And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight
Apart from the walls they just did not exist I doubt if a napalm bomb
attack could have created more devastation I counted  blackened brick
and concrete shells that had once been homes Each house had been deliberately
fired by petrol Under red tile roofs which had caved in I found a twisted
mass of bed springs children's conts and cribs and ankle deep grey
ashes of what had once been chairs tables and wardrobes

In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios a mile away I counted 
wrecked and burned out homes They were all Turkish Cypriot homes From
this village more than  Turkish Cypriots had also vanishedIn neither village
did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house

 GRAVES OF  SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE

 Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the

 crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios  miles away were
 brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment Three
 more bodies including one of a woman were discovered nearby but could
 not be removed Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to
 locate the bodies of  more believed to have been buried on the same site

How dare you presume that he even has a right to go around a newsgroup
with a desire to convince others of any external position he has

They are news because they are the exceptions And the 'Islamic Holocaust'
is much the topic of the day The historical evidence proves that during
the period of  to  the Armenian Government ordered incited
assisted and participated in the genocide of  million Muslim people
because of race religion and national origin Armenians perpetrated acts
of sabotage destroyed telephone cables blew up bridges blocked passes
set up ambushes attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts
behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand and on the other ruthlessly
attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages slaughtering the Turkish population
indiscriminately women children old and young alike Innocent
Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death or massacred with
axes and swords or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt
alive as can be seen below

Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions
of Van Kars Sivas Erzurum Bitlis Erzincan Mus Diyarbakir and
Maras The Ottoman Army while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion
also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from
behind The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of
Eastern Anatolia Starting from late  Armenians committed
widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia because the arena
was left to the Armenians Almost every Turkish town and village from
Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide
by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian
Russian American British Ottoman German Austrian and French
journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century
committed by the bloodthirsty Armenian genocide squads

The Ottoman Army liberating Trabzon Bayburt Erzincan Erzurum
Kars and other regions from the Russians saw that the cities and their
villages had been destroyed and burnt people slaughtered massacred
The massacres conducted by Armenians which became a black stain for
humanity shocked and disgusted even the Russian British German
Austrian French and American authorities

Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and
cruelties The inhuman treatment cruelties atrocities genocide by
Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish
and Kurdish people are sufficiently reflected in historical documents
Even today over seventyfive years later the terrifying screams of
the victims of these cruelties can be heard

I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and
 Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia Although two months
 have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs I
 have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at
 almost every step All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from
 Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly
 slain are everywhere According to accounts by those who were able to
 save their lives by escaping to mountains the first horrible and fearful
 events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then
 taken over by Armenian gangs The Russians usually treated the people
 well but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians Once these
 places had been taken over by the Armenians however the massacres begun
 They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the
 Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus solve the nationality
 problem Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers
 who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and
 Alexander Paul GumruLeninakanRussian officers tried to save the
 Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs
 I am now in Erzurum and what I see is terrible Almost the whole city is
 destroyed The smell of the corpses still fills the air Although there are
 speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as
 well I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard but there is
 proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war

   Turkey sends light weapons as aid to Azerbaijan

By SEVA ULMAN

ANKARA Turkey UPI  Turkey is arming Azerbaijan with light weapons to help
it fight Armenian forces in the struggle for the Nagorno Karabakh enclave
the newspaper Hurriyet said Thursday

Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was
responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance

We are giving a positive response to all requests from Azerbaijan within
the limits of our capabilities he said

Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature
of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan but said they were within the framework
of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe

Hurriyet published in Istanbul said Turkey was sending light weapons to
Azerbaijan including rockets rocket launchers and ammunition

Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a
highranking Azerbaijani official Turkey has however ruled out for the second
time in one week that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan

Wednesday Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer
defeat at the hands of the Armenians We feel ourselves bound to help
Azerbaijan but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form that
help may take in the future he said

He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing and the whole world knows
about it

Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get
militarily involved in the conflict Foreign policy decisions could not be
based on streetlevel excitement he said

There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports based on
Armenian sources in Yerevan saying Turkish pilots and other officers were
captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and
helicopters

The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border
with Armenia but military sources denied reports based on claims by local
people that gunfire was heard along the border No military action has
occurred the sources said

The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared
early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later
positioned themselves outside Fizuli near the Iranian border

                      Yigal et al sue ADL

  Nineteen people including the son off ormer Israeli Defence Minister Moshe
 Arens sued the AntiDefamation League ADL on Wednesday accusing the
 Jewish group of disclosing confidential official information about them

     Richard Hirschhaut director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL art
 dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as
 defendants in the suit filed in San Francisco County Superior Court

     The  accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith a group dedicated to fighting
 antiSemitism and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on
 them including data from state and federal agencies

     The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others including the
 governments of Israel and South Africa in what it alleges was a a massive
 spying operation''

     The action is a classaction suit It was filed on behalf of about 
 antiapartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the
 plaintiffs believe the ADL Bullock and Gerard gathered information

     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately
 available for comment on Wednesday

     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that
 Gerard a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit
 passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy
 ring

     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL Bullock and
 Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San
 Francisco and Los Angeles

     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California
 which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official
 sources  It seeks exemplary damages of at least  per person as well as
 other unspecified damages

 Lawyer Pete McCloskey a former Congresmen who is representing the
 plaintiffs said the  plaintiffs included ArabAmericans and Jews  and
 his wife Helen who also had information gathered about her

     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens a research scientist at the
 University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence
 Minister

     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on
 him in the s presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of
 Palestinians and his position on the Israelioccupied territories

     According to court documents released last week Bullock and Gerard both
 kept information on thousands of California political activists

     In the documents a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid
 Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and
 Bullock received confidential information from the authorities

     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case The ADL Bullock and
 Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing

The latest Israeli proposal first proposed in February of  contains
the following assumptions concerning the nature of any interim status refering to the WB and Gaza the Palestinians implemented by negotiations It
states that
   Israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status
    is agreed upon
   Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the
    Interim SelfGovernment Arrangements ISGA
   The ISGA will apply to the Palestinian inhabitants of the territories
    under Israeli military administration The arrangements will not have a
    territorial application nor will they apply to the Israeli population
    of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem
   Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel
   Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd
   Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects
    external internal and for the maintenance of public order
   The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrativefunctional nature
   The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and
    coordination with Israel
   Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the
    areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education
    business tourism labor and social welfare local police
    local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious
    affairs

The Palestinian counterproposal of March 
   The establishment of a Palestinian Interim SelfGoverning Authority
    PISGA whose authority is vested by the Palestinian people
   Its PISGA powers cannot be delegated by Israel
   In the interim phase the Israeli military government and civil adminis
    tration will be abolished and the PISGA will asume the powers previous
    ly enjoyed by Israel
   There will be no limitations on its PISGA powers and responsibilities
    except those which derive from its character as an interim arrangement
   By the time PISGA is inaugurated the Israeli armed forces will have
    completed their withdrawal to agreed points along the borders of the
    Occupied Palestinian Territory OPT The OPT includes Jerusalem
   The jurisdiction of the PISGA shall extend to all of the OPT including
    its land water and air space
   The PISGA shall have legislative powers to enact amend and abrogate laws
   It will wield executive power withput foreign control
   It shall determine the nature of its cooperation with any state or
    international body and shall be empowered to conclude binding coopera
    tive agreements free of any control by Israel
   The PISGA shall administer justice throughout the OPT and will have sole
    and exclusive jruisdiction
   It will have a strong police force responsible for security and public
    order in the OPT
   It can request the assistance of a UN peacekeeping force
   Disputes with Israel over selfgoverning arrangements will be settled by
    a committee composed of representatives of the five permanent members of
    the UN Security Council the Secretary General of the UN the PISGA
    Jordan Egypt Syria and Israel

But perhaps the bargaining attitude behind these very different visions
of the interim stage is wrong For two reasons  the present Palestinian
and Israeli leadership are as moderate as is likely to exist for many years
so the present opportunity may be the last for a significant period  since
these negotiations are not designed to or even attempting to resolve the
conflict attention to issues dealing with a desired final status are mis
placed and potentially destructive

Given this how should proposals from either side be altered to temper
their maximalist approaches as stated above How can Israeli worries and
desire for some interim control be addressed while providing for a very
real interim Palestinian selfgoverning entity

Tim

April   response by Al Moore LLMSCISLMSCLOCKHEEDCOM

Basically the problem is that Israel may remain or leave the occupied
territories it cannot do both it cannot do neither So far Israe
continues to propose that they remain The Palestinians propose that they
leave Why should either change their view It is worth pointing out that
the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a
reduction in the Israeli presence Israel proposes no such reduction
and in fact may be said to not be negotiating


Tim

There seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed The
first is that of Israel where there is little trust for Arab groups so
there is little support for Israel giving up tangible assets in
exchange for pieces of paper expectations hopes etc The second
is that of the Arab worldPalestinians where there is the demand that
these tangible concessions be made by Israel without it receiving
anything tangible back  Given this the gap between the two stances
seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some tangible returns
for its expected concessions By tangible is meant something that
 provides Israel with comparable protection from the land it is to
give up  in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine
will be accountable and held actively not just diplomatically
responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory by citizens
or visitors

In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian
statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel
was assured that any new Palestinian state would be committed to
coexisting with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel
from its territory
	Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above
	how could such guarantees be instilled For example
	how could such guaranteescontrols be added to the
	Palestinian PISGA proposals

Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute
it lets go gives lands back to Arab states no more buffer zone gives
full autonomy to Palestinians ANY andor ALL of the Arab parties
could and would if not controlled somehow EASILY return to the
traditional antiIsrael position The question then is HOW to really
ensure that that will not happen

 Lebanese resistance forces detonated a bomb under an Israeli occupation

 two wounded In retaliation Israeli and Israelibacked forces wounded
  civilians by bombarding several Lebanese villages Ironically the Israeli
 government justifies its occupation in Lebanon by claiming that it is
 necessary to prevent such bombardments of Israeli villages

 Congratulations to the brave men of the Lebanese resistance With every

I recently read that during Bill Clinton's campaign he stated
that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital  According to the article Mr Clinton
reaffirmed this after winning the presidency  However
during recent talks with President Mubarak Secretary of
State Christopher stated that the status of Jerusalem
will be a final matter of discussion between the parties

Now I don't want to start a big discussion over the status
of Jerusalem  All I want to know is if anyone can
authenticate Mr Clinton's statements with dates places etc

Thank you

The readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents
of those files
So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us
 Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous

ADL authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous including
the millions of Americans of Arab ancestry  Perhaps you can answer
the question as to why the ADL maintained files and spied on ADC members
in California and elsewhere  Friendly rivalry perhaps

Come on  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war
against Israel  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations  That is
the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals
only a few years ago

Perhaps Yigal is a Greenpeace member Or the NAACP Or a reporter
Or a member of any of the dozens of other political organizationsethnic
minoritiesoccupations that the ADL spied on

All of these groups have in the past associated with or been a part of anti
Israel activity or propoganda  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if
anything comes up they won't be caught by surprise

 Why does the ADL have an interest in that person 

Paranoia

No that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel aside from
the fact that there is no world trade center and why people like Zein Isa 
Palestinian whose American group planned to bow up the Israeli Embassy and
kill many Jews are caught  As Mordechai Levy of the JDL said Paranoid
Jews live longer

 If one does trust either the US government or the ADL what an
   additional information should he send them 

The names of half the posters on this forum unless they already
have them

They probably do

  I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on
  in Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda There are no a priori
  black and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in

  If the attack was justified or not is at least debatable But this is not the

  Dorin

 Dorin of all the criticism of my post expressed on tpm this one I accept
 I regret that aspect of my post It is my hope that the occupation will end and
 the accompanying loss of life but I believe that stiff resistance can help to
 achieve that end Despite what some have said on tpm I think that there is
 a point when losses are unacceptable The strategy drove US troops out of
 Lebanon at least

 Brad Hernlem hernlemchessncsuEDU

Hi Brad

I have two comments  Regarding your hope that the occupation will end
belive that stiff resistanceetc  how about an untried approach ie
peace and cooperation  I can't help but wonder what would happen if all
violence against Israelis stopped  Hopefully violence against Arabs
would stop at the same time  If a state of nonviolence could be
maintained perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved ie
greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the
territories

Of course given the current leadership of Israel your way may work
also  but if that leadership changes eg to someone with Ariel
Sharon's mentality then I would predict a considerable loss of life
ie no winners

Secondly regarding your comment about the US troops responding
to stiff resistance  the analogy is not quite valid  The US
troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether  The Israelis
could not

Just my  worth no offense intended

Respectfully

Ben

   Lezghis Astir

By NEJLA SAMMAKIA
 Associated Press Writer

GUSSAR Azerbaijan AP  The  Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have
begun clamoring for their own state threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner
of the Caucasus

The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring NagornoKarabakh
Abkhazia and Ossetia but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former
Soviet Union to fight for independence

Lezghis who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds are angry about the
conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's yearold undeclared
war with Armenia

They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia which
were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national
borders that had been only lines on a map

A rally of more than  Lezghis in March to protest conscription and
demand a separate Lezghistan alarmed the Azerbaijani government

Officials in Baku the capital deny rumors that police shot six
demonstrators to death But the government announced strict security measures
and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of
Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia

Visitors to Gussar the center of Lezhgi life found the town quiet soon
after the protest Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air

At the Sunday bazaar men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to
discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a
war they say is not theirs

I have been drafted but I won't go said Shamil Kadimov gold teeth
glinting in the sun Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis I have
nothing to do with Armenia

More than  people have died in the war which centers on the disputed
territory of NagornoKarabakh about  miles to the southeast

Malik Kerimov an official in the mayor's office said only  of  locals
drafted in  had served

The police don't force people to go he said They are afraid of an
uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan

All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators but
disagreed on how the protest came about

Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was
about to draft  men from the Gussar region where  Lezghis live

Others said the rally was ordered by Gen Muhieddin Kahramanov leader of the
Lezhgi underground separatist movement Sadval based in Dagestan

We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about
draft orders said Kerim Babayev a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval

We hope to reunite peacefully by approaching everyone  the Azerbaijanis
the Russians

In the early th century the Lezhgis formed two khanates or sovereignties
in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan They roamed freely with their sheep
over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates

By  the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia After  they
came under Soviet rule With the disintegration of the Soviet Union the
 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders

About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan

We have to pay customs on all this on cars on wine complained Mais
Talibov a small trader His goods laid out on the ground at the bazaar
included brandy stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan

We want our own country he said We want to be able to move about easily
But Baku won't listen to us

Physically it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other
Azerbaijanis In many villages they live side by side working at the same
jobs and intermarrying to some degree

But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language a mixture of Arabic Turkish and
Persian with strong guttural vowels

Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its  largest
ethnic minorities The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary
school classes in their language

Autonomy is a different question If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from
Azerbaijan they would set a precedent for other minorities such as the
Talish in the south the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern
Azerbaijan

                   THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS


  Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip
  during the threeweeklong closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the
  Jewish state Palestinian sources said on Sunday

  The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of
  the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of housetohouse raids for
  Palestinian activists during the closure which was imposed on the strip and
  occupied West Bank

  If you are tired of learning about American foreign policy from what is
  effectively Israeli controlled media I highly recommend checking out the
  Washington Report  A free sample copy is available by calling the American

I took your advice and ordered a copy of the Washinton Report  I
heartily recommend it to all proIsrael types for the following
reasons

  It is an excellent absorber of excrement  I use it to line
    the bottom of my parakeet's  cage  A negative side effect is
    that my bird now has a somewhat warped view of the mideast

  It makes a great April Fool's joke ie give it to someone
    who knows nothing about the middle east and then say April
    Fools


Clearly if a Chutzpa reacts this way it must be worth reading by
more objective types  You are so wrapped up in your hate that you
can't even take the time to edit out my long posting  Thanks for
the extra milege by reposting it

Ten questions to Israelis


I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to
provide
 accurate answers to the following specific questions These are
indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
people around me

      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize
Israeli nationality  And that ID cards which Israeli citizens
must carry at all times identify people as Jews or Arabs not as
Israelis 

      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders
and that Israeli governments from  until today have refused to
state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be


      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons  If so
could you provide any evidence 

      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of
individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
state secrets 

      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied
territories are subject to different laws than nonJews

      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 
to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return while their
Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return 

      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister Y Rabin signed
an order for ethnical cleansing in  as is done today in
BosniaHerzegovina 

      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as
members in kibbutzim

      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage
marriages between Jews and nonJews 

     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the
site of a muslim cemetery

When the PLO moved into Lebanon and became in parts of Lebanon an

   First this man promotes the dissolution of the Jews through an
intermarriage process and then says that it will be just a bunch
of 'fundamentalist' Jews who will object  This clown even called
for 'buying' the dissolution of the Jewish people

   Does this idiot mean to suggest that any Jew who objects to an
imibicilic notion like this is fundamentalist  Or does he simply
mean to insult the orthodox by using the word 'fundamentalist'

   I am not orthodox  I am not fundamentalist  I would desire a
genuine peace in the region more than this pinhead  Davidsson can
ever understand  But when he shows his willingness to dismiss an
entire culture he proves that the only thing more brainboggling
than his stupidity is his willingness to display his stupidity in

So nice of you all to answer some questions  And it so nice that most
of you feel that it would be in your hearts to give the Palestinians
some land  most of you focus on the fact that Israel annexed all
this land and it is a kind gesture to give some of it back  Well
I hope that after after a state run by Palestinians is established
the first decision should be to make Jerusalem part of this state 
by annexing it of course

Aside from spelling  why is that you TURKS DO NOT want to admit your
past MISTAKES  You know TURKISH INVASION of CYPRUS was a mistake and too
bad that UN DID NOT do anything about it You may ask  mistake 
Yes I would say Why is that the GREEKS DID NOT INVADE CYPRUS 

My response to the shooting down of a Turkish airplane over the Armenian
air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your
Country Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan The KARABAKHIARMENIANS who have lived
in their HOMELAND for  years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS
BY STALIN are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending
themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT
people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG's and othe Russian aircraft

At last I hope that the US insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH
crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again

I sure hope so Because the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must

previous years

Well there is a bit such as the German reparations to the jewish
survivors of the Holocaust Certainly as such an event goes further
into the past reparations become less realistic

I was convinced that no one could have a more warped sense of the
world They were 'our' grandparents who were coldbloodedly exterminated
by the Armenians between  and  not yours And you can always
participate in 'The Turkish Genocide Day' along with millions of Turkish
and Kurdish people on April   in the United States and Canada

On this occasion we once again reiterate the unquestioned
justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and

 We demand that the xSoviet Armenian Government admit its
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide render
reparations to the Muslim people and return the land to its
rightful owners The recognition of the Genocide has become an
issue which cannot be delayed further and it is imperative that
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed

 We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide adopts
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures
to the contrary

 As taxpayers of the United States we express our vehement
protest to the present US Government policy of continued
coddling protection and unqualified assistance towards xSoviet
Armenia

 We also demand that the United States return to the policies
advocated by US Ambassador Bristol and other enlightened statesmen
who have undertaken a just human and benevolent attitude towards
the rights of the Muslim people and the just resolution of their Case

 Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at xSoviet Armenia's

Happy the minority Jews which has had no Christian nation to protect it
 And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey
 when they were expelled from Europe especially Spain by Saintly Christians
 and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and
 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers To one brought up as most Americans have
 been in the Gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of
 the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious
 differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they
 were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every
 nation in the world would have treated as treasonable One readily
 reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate

He also stated that

they Armenians traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian
 invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and
 fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least
 a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population


                TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUST

An  interview  with  Stanford  J Shaw  History  who  recently
completed  two books  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the
Turkish Republic and Turkey and  the Holocaust Turkey's Role in
Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution
 Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree
program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for
the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry He is affiliated with the
G E von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies

Editor How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and
European and Turkish Jews

Shaw Basically I'm  an Ottoman historian but  I'm also Jewish
I've  spent twentyfive  years studying  Ottoman history  and as
time went along whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews
I collected  them But  I never  did anything  with them  until a
couple of years  ago when I suddenly realized that   was the
th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and
coming  to Turkey  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire
Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman
Jewry  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated  and I  became
motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book The
Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish  Republic This book
is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians who
tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint
of the Jews  and the Jewish community and rely  mainly on Jewish
sources  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian  and  I
approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of
view of Ottoman  society using largely Ottoman  sources After I
finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press  I came  across
additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War
II In the completed book I had said that Turkey had done a good
deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II but  I did  not
actually have many details Then I  found a batch of documents in
the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish
diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust It
was too late to add this new information to the book in press so
I decided to  write a second book I  conducted further research
mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the
Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris The result was the second
book Turkey and  the Holocaust which details  how Turkey helped
rescue Jews from the Nazis

 How exactly did they do this

The story takes  place over a number of years  The book presents
the material in three parts first of which deals with the period
before the Holocaust When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in
  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  antiNazi
Germans from universities  hospitals scientific institutes and
the like Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of
reforming its  universities and it  saw in these Jews  who were
being fired from their positions in Germany a good source of new
talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities Within three
months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews  Turkey
arranged to take many of them in They were brought to Turkey and
were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish
universities as  heads of scientific institutes  and as medical
personnel in hospitals About   to  major Jewish professors
came to  Turkey in  the s Ernst  Reuter a  German political
scientist  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in
Turkey After  World War II  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the
Berlin Airlift  Fritz Neimark a major  German Jewish economist
came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics
in Istanbul  A man named  Reichenbach who was rescued  from the
Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey eventually
came to  UCLA where he  became a professor of  philosophy Other
German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey
One  such was  Karl  Ebert  who had  been  a leading  theatrical
producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis He went to
Turkey where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the
Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara with the  help of Paul
Hindemuth So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first
phase when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by
Turkey  Oddly enough  the  German emigres  when  they were  in
Turkey did not seem to think too badly of Germany They regarded
themselves more  as Germans than Jews  and they did not  join in
the antiNazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community I
even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey
praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting
the idea  of German  culture Even though  these people  had been
persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks they shared the
Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks The
second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust which began in
 when the Nazis occupied France  In Europe at that time and
especially in France there were  about  Turkish Jews They
had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of
the century onward Most of them had settled in Europe during the
Turkish war for  independence after World War I  when Greece was
threatening to overrun Turkey The Greeks had persecuted the Jews
throughout the nineteenth century and the Jews feared what might
happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey Many Jews fled
to France during  the s and s Many  also abandoned their
Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens Suddenly  the
Nazis invaded France in  and started introducing all sorts of
antiJewish laws  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not
worth very much to  be a French Jew but that it  was worth a lot
to be a Turkish Jew

 How so

Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II It retained
its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazioccupied countries
until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the
end of  During the war  therefore Turkey was in a position
to  defend its  citizens  against antiJewish  measures and  the
actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of
the  book Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in
particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from
the Nazis For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish
citizenship  there  was  generally  no  problem  If  they  were
arrested and sent to a  concentration camp the Turkish diplomats
would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other
officials and say in effect  These people are Turkish citizens
You  can't do  this  to  them And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be
released  If  their  businesses were  confiscated  the  Turkish
diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored

The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey
They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion
of the Middle  East and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and
manganese from Turkey In order  to keep Turkish friendship they
usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews
The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps
to secure the release of Turkish Jews At times they even boarded
trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and
succeeded in getting them off the train Most of the foreign Jews
were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in
Paris  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish
consuls took place

The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned
their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens The
consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens
because  they were  not  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews
lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate  either to  get
passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their
Turkish  citizenship   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter  so
processing the application would take  some time In the meantime
it was a  real emergency because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on
the streets for almost nothing  The Nazis would even arrest them
if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments because
radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews  To take  care of
these  former  Turkish Jews  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a
document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash or  irregular fellow
citizen The  document said in  effect This person is  a former
Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his
Turkish citizenship  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if
you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen  The
diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on
it Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish on the  whole they
accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship  By this
means the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who
had relinquished their Turkish citizenship

Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of
Jews On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry which wanted to
retain the friendship of Turkey  was in favor of accepting these
interventions On the other hand Himmler and Eichmann wanted all
Jews exterminated  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to
prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz
before the Turkish consuls could do anything

 Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued

There were about   Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War
II  about   of whom  were living  in France  Most of  the
information in this section of  the book relates to the situation
in France I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls
sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in
reply Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would
present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are
Turkish citizens  and promise  to send them  out of  France the
Nazis would release them from the concentration camp The Turkish
consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from
Nazioccupied  territory   back  to  Turkey  These   trains  ran
regularly in  and  The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas
so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory but the  trains were
often  held  up by  the  Naziinfluenced  governments of  Eastern
Europe     Croatia  Serbia   and  Bulgaria     because  these
governments really didn't want the Jews to escape As a result of
the Turkish consuls' efforts about  to  of the Turkish
Jews  in  France were  saved  Another    were sent  off  to
Auschwitz where  most of them  died The remaining   either
escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of
southern France occupied  by the Italians who  treated Jews much
better than  the Nazis did  At the  end of   however Italy
fell out of the war and that was the end for those Jews as well
Incidentally the Turkish diplomats  in Nazioccupied Greece also
worked to rescue Jews in that country

 The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats
acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin
from Nazi persecution

Yes  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here  In  their
interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews the Turks  cited their
treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German
territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey
On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not
discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews  The Nazis
claimed  and the  Vichy government  agreed that  they were  not
discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally
Turkey  protested   saying  You  are  dividing   our  citizens
according to religion but the Turkish constitution requires that
all  citizens   be  treated  equally  regardless   of  religion
Therefore you cannot single  out Turkish Jews American consuls
in  Paris  by contrast  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told
American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they
couldn't do  anything about  it because  the American  Jews were
being treated the same as other  Jews The third part of the book
takes place in Turkey which  was the principal center during the
Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European
Jews The  kwish Agency an  organization established by  Jews in
Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine set up an office in
Istanbul  in   under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas  Other
Jewish organizations in Palestine especially the kibbutzes also
sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters These
groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out
what was  happening Today  we know about  the Holocaust  but at
that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on They  didn't
imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing And so the
first step was to get information and the Turkish government let
them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and
friends  in Eastern  Europe The  Jewish organizations  found out
what was happening when they  received replies Later on when the
Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters  the  Jews  received
assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio  Angelo Roncali  who
served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from   to
  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII  As   the  Vatican
representative  during the  war he  used the  facilities of  the
Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was
doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern
Europe  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government these
agencies  then  sent  hard  currency food  clothing  and  even
railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia
Bulgaria Romania and Hungary They weren't able to help much in
Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the
Polish Jews  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for
the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the
so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul or by  boat through
the Black Sea to Istanbul

Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its
borders during  the war because  it was being blockaded  and was
suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing   The
government   therefore   facilitated   the  movement   of   the
nonTurkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine either by
the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and
Palestine  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean
from southern  Turkey to  Palestine These efforts  were bitterly
opposed not only  by the Nazis but also by  the British who did
not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they
feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs The British
constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic
and send those Jews back In  a few cases the Turkish government
yielding  to  British pressure  did  send  the boats  back  For
example in  one incident  the steamship  Struma with  some 
Jewish  refugees  from Romania  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish
government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British
ambassador When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine all
were lost except one person  Nevertheless all told the Turkish
government allowed no fewer than  Eastern European Jews to
pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during
the Second World War The Turkish authorities also provided these
refugees with facilities  and money and gave  them permission to
send money and food out of the country

 Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be
living in Israel

Yes and  their children But  let's return  for a moment  to the
first group the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe They did not
go  on  to   Palestine  they  stayed  in  Turkey   It  was  the
nonTurkish Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en
route to Palestine Their story is very interesting

 And you have rescued it from obscurity

Many studies have been made of the Holocaust but most of them do
not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews Most of
the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews of
whom  million were massacred by the Nazis My study deals with a
much smaller  number of  people I  have tried  to round  out the
picture  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to
undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews

When it  comes to numbers  the German Jews were  also relatively
small in number Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews The
rescue  of    Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so
significant  compared  with  the  total of    million  who  were
murdered but it meant a lot to those who were saved

About  threefourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  
translations  of many  documents They  are included  because the
story is not well known Not  only are people in the West unaware
of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats even  the
people of Turkey  did not know the story I  felt that they would
not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they
could see the documents

 What languages are used in the documents

Most of them are in Turkish  or French some are in Hebrew There
is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of
the boats  going to Palestine the  passengers and so on  but I
did not go into those details extensively I describe mostly what
Turkey did so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French A
few documents are  in English The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did
not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews in
fact they often fought with  one another They took turns trying
to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups  For
example some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency
was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in
helping  Western  European  Jews  Finally  in    President
Roosevelt sent a personal  representative Ira Hirschman who had
been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York
City and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences The
documents related to his mission are in English

I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld a Holocaust
historian in France  who mainly worked on the  French Jews His
father was  killed by  the Nazis  He gave  me materials  he had
gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews so I didn't
personally consult the German archives  I believe that much more
can  be learned  from the  German  archives and  I hope  someone
someday will make the effort

 This new book fits in well with your teaching doesn't it

Right I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the
Ottoman  Empire  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago  In
addition to  research writing and teaching  I've been actively
involved in  the commemoration  of the  th anniversary  of the
coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire Among  other things I
helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject
which was held in Istanbul in 

 Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken
place what do you plan to do next

I'm working on two new books One is a history of the Turkish War
for Independence which took place  after World War I during the
years   to   The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the
victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its
independence The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid

important modernizer in his own  way although he also suppressed

Let me clearify Mr Turkish
ARMENIA is NOT getting itchy SHE is simply LETTING the WORLD KNOW that
SHE WILL NO  LONGER sit there QUIET and LET TURKS get away with their FAMOUS
tricks Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH invasion of the Greek island of
CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED

And the 'Turkish Karabag' is next As for 'Cyprus' In  Turkiye
stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population
there This is nothing but a simple historical fact Unfortunately
the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims Mass
graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed
what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority

The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of
oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot
officials and their violation of the cofounder status of
the Turks set out in the constitution The coup d'etat
engineered by Greece in  to execute a final solution
to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked
Turkiye's intervention Turkiye intervened reluctantly and
only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues
consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories
to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus There simply
was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at
all This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which
was openly expansionist stated as 'Enosis' union with Greece
Since the creation of independent Cyprus in  the Turkish
population although smaller legally had status as the cofounder
of the republic with the Greek population

The Greek Cypriots with the support of 'Enosis'minded
Greeks in the mainland have consistently ignored that
status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with
a minority population of Turks The Turks of Cyprus are
not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the
only way they could show that was to assert their
autonomy in a separate republic

Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo She would
rather not be involved with the island But given the
dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish
population in Cyprus she simply cannot leave the fate
of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until
the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord
the two communities finally reach to guarantee that
history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots
of their rights liberties and their very lives

   Throughout Cyprus
  Following the Greek Cypriot premeditated onslaught of  December
    the Turkish Sectors all over Cyprus were completely besieged
   by Greeks all telephonic telegraphic and postal communications
   between these sectors were cut off and the Turkish Cypriot
   Community's contact with each other and with the outside world
   was thus prevented

     Turkish Quarter of Nicosia and suburbs
  Greek Cypriot armed elements broke into hundreds of Turkish
   homes and fired at the unarmed occupants with automatic
   weapons killing at random many Turks including women children
   and elderly persons  Turks were killed and  wounded They
   also carried away as hostages more than  Turks including
   women and children whom they forced to walk barefooted and
   in nightdresses across rough fields and river beds

      Throughout Cyprus
   The Greek Cypriot Administration deprived Turkish Cypriots
   including Ministers MPs and Turkish members of the Public
   services of the republic of their right to freedom of movement

   In his report No S of  December  to the Security
   Council the UN SecretaryGeneral stated in this respect the
   following

  Restrictions on the free movement of civilians have been one of
   the major features of the situation in Cyprus since the early
   stages of the disturbances these restrictions have inflicted
   considerable hardship on the population especially the Turkish
   Cypriot Community and have kept tension high

      Throughout Cyprus

      Supply of petrol was completely denied to the Turkish sections

   This wanton murder of a fourmonthold baby which shocked foreign

p  second paragraph

 I had received further very definite information of horrors that
  had been committed by the Armenian soldiery in Kars Plain and as
  I had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their
  treatment of my own detached parties I had wired to Tiflis from
  Zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the Armenians should not
  be left in independent command of the Moslem population as their
  troops being without discipline and not under effective control
  atrocities were constantly being committed for which we should
  with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible'

 Armenian troops who having pillaged and destroyed all the
  Moslem villages in the plain

 Caravans of refugees were in the meanwhile constantly arriving from the
  plain from which the whole Moslem population was fleeing with as much of
  their personal property as they could transport seeking to obtain security
  and protection

p  first paragraph

 In those Moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched
  for arms by the Armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of
  such search and not only had many Moslems been killed but horrible
  tortures had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as
  to where valuables had been hidden of which the Armenians were aware
  of the existence although they had been unable to find them

 Shortly afterwards the head of the miserable column appeared There
  were in all about  persons mostly old men and women and children
  with a few oxcarts ponies and donkeys carrying all their worldly

 The arrival of this British brigade was followed by the announcement
  that Kars Province had been allotted by the Supreme Council of the
  Allies to the Armenians and that announcement having been made the
  British troops were then completely withdrawn and Armenian occupation
  commenced Hence all the trouble for the Armenians at once commenced
  the wholesale robbery and persecution of the Muslem population on the

   Buch of CRAP and you know it NagarnoKarabagh has ALWAYS been PART

   review the HISTORY

If a 'dog's prayers were answered bones would rain from the sky
Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name
Before  before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians
drove all the TurksMuslims out it was a Turkish majority town Well
anyway it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the
Nazis

 Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously
  proNazi proRussia proSoviet Armenia proArab proJewish

  antiSoviet  whichever was expedient

As a dear friend put it the Tzeghagrons Armenian Racial Patriots
was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun It was based in
Boston where ASALASDPAARF Terrorism Triangle is located but
had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world Literally
Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race' The architect
of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh a Nazi Armenian
who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II
In  he had been invited to the United States by the Central
Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the

Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons Starting with 
chapters in the initial year the Tzeghagrons grew to  chapters

Now wait there is more

THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians
in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan  about
 men  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
fouryear war over Nagorny Karabakh

The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators  Hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the Baku press Diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates

The   February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of
the last moves  in their fouryear campaign to  take full control
of Nagorny Karabakh  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
in Rome on Monday The bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and  a massacre but  investigators say that most  of the
dead were civilians The awful  number of people killed was first
suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku
Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  griefstricken
Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 
dead

The State Prosecuter Aydin Rasulov  the cheif investigator of a
man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  Hojali
Disaster said  his figure of   people dead was a  minimum on
preliminary  findings  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman
Memmedov the mayor of Hojali An  even higher one was printed in
the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May   dead  people named and more
than  bodies reported unidentified  This figure of nearly 
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova the new spokeswoman
of the Azeri Ministry of Defence

FranCois Zen  Ruffinen head  of delegation of  the International
Red Cross  in Baku said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
Agdam had reported a figure of   bodies received at his mosque
from  Hojali most  of  them  civilians We  did  not count  the
bodies But  the figure seems  reasonable It is no  fantasy Mr
Zen Ruffinen said We have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead

Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
number of  dead in the  massacre Don't  get worked up  It will
take  several months  to  get a  final  figure the  yearold
lawyer said at his small office

Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things It  took him two  years to
reach  a firm  conclusion that    people were  killed and  
wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
uprising in Baku in January 

Those  nationalists the  Popular  Front finally  came to  power
three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
what  happened when  Hojali an  Azeri town  which lies  about 
miles from the border with Armenia fell to the Armenians

Officially  people have so  far been certified as dead being
the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
republic's forensic department This  is just a small percentage
of the dead said Rafiq Youssifov the republic's chief forensic
scientist They were the only bodies brought to us Remember the
chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within  hours

Of these  people  were women and  were children under 
years old  Gunshots killed   people  shrapnel killed   and
axes or  blunt instruments  killed   Exposure in  the highland
snows killed the last three  Thirtythree people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation including ears  noses breasts or penises
cut off and  eyes gouged out according  to Professor Youssifov's
report Those  bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed Mr Rasulov said

Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
disorganised   lists of   Azeri militiamen are dead  here six
policemen there  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant the
names of   corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day The
most heartbreaking account from   witnesses interviewed so far
comes  from Towfiq  Manafov  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a
helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  
February

There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly   in Hojali  people  by the stream
and the road and   visible around Nakhchivanik village Mr
Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
pilot

People waved up  to us for help We saw  three dead children and
one  twoyearold alive  by  one  dead woman  The  live one  was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up We tried to land but
Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
return

There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali
at the time  many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by Armenian forces

So nice of you all to answer some questions  And it so nice that most
of you feel that it would be in your hearts to give the Palestinians
some land  most of you focus on the fact that Israel annexed all
this land and it is a kind gesture to give some of it back  Well
I hope that after after a state run by Palestinians is established
the first decision should be to make Jerusalem part of this state 
by annexing it of course

Israel has not annexed any of the West Bank just Jeruselum  Which

 Ten questions to Israelis
 

 I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to
 provide
  accurate answers to the following specific questions These are
 indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
 people around me

       Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize
 Israeli nationality  And that ID cards which Israeli citizens
 must carry at all times identify people as Jews or Arabs not as
 Israelis 


	That's true Israeli ID cards do not identify people
	as Israelies Smart huh


       Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons  If so
 could you provide any evidence 

	Yes There's one warhead in my parent's backyard in
	Beer Sheva that's only some  miles from Dimona
	you know Evidence I saw it


       Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of
 individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
 identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
 state secrets 

	Yes But unfortunately I can't give you more details
	That's secret you see

The readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents

So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us
 Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous

ADL authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous including
the millions of Americans of Arab ancestry  Perhaps you can answer
the question as to why the ADL maintained files and spied on ADC members
in California and elsewhere  Friendly rivalry perhaps

Perhaps Yigal is a Greenpeace member Or the NAACP Or a reporter
Or a member of any of the dozens of other political organizationsethnic
minoritiesoccupations that the ADL spied on

 Why does the ADL have an interest in that person 

Paranoia

 If one does trust either the US government or the ADL what an

My response to the shooting down of a Turkish airplane over the Armenian
air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your
Country Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan The KARABAKHIARMENIANS who have lived
in their HOMELAND for  years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS
BY STALIN are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending
themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT
people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG's and othe Russian aircraft

At last I hope that the US insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH
crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again


Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan  It is Armenian
soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan
You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression
only in that region  It seems to me that the Armenians are better
organized have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns
repeatedly

I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion  Turkey had the right to
intervene and it did  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to
last for so long but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both
on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed
for the ongoing standoff in the region

Lastly why is there not a socculturearmenia  I vote yes for it
After all it is now free

 TO MR NAPOLEON


 Well Panos Mr Tamamidis the way you put it it is only the Turks
 who bear the responsibility of the things happening today That is hard to
 believe for somebody trying to be objective
 When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
 blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides
 What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW anyway
 Do you think it was your right to be there

 There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor
until  Someone had to protect them If not us who


Is that so or you were taking advantage of weakness of ottoman
empire to grab some land As soon as you got green lights from
allied forces you occupied Izmir and other cities in western
Turkey You killed and  raped millions people without any reason
Of course you paid the price Mustafa Kemal Ataturk made
you swim in aegean sea but not far enough Your aggressions thru
Turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall
not get you anywhere


 I am not saying that conflicts started with that It is only
 not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
 It is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
 I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
 visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey I thought it
 was a positive attempt to make the relations better

Compromise on what the invasion of Cyprus the involment of Turkey in
Greek politics the refusal of Turkey to accept  miles of territorial
waters as stated by international law the properties of the Greeks of
Konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the Greek lakesorry Aegean


What compromise are you talking about on Cyprus That is not Greece
business to join the island to Greece That is up to people in the island
to live or not to live together They made their decision and they are
living  separetely nowThere is a peace there Greeks can't slaughter
Turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there
Your dream will never come true  mile territorialwater
Are you joking or dreaming We can declare our  miles territorial
water which can come close to Athens How would you like it
If you have any guts why don't you shoot at some Turkish ships
in your dream  mile territorial waters
We do not have any city called Konstantinople We have a city
called ISTANBUL All the greeks in Istanbul are being
treated just any other Turks There is no difference among people
in Turkey You look at your own backyard first before talking
about human rights in Turkey What are the rights of Turks in Greece
Nothing They do not even have basic human rights like right to
have property fredom of religion fredom of press fredom of
vote elect their community leaders Government of Greece publicly
encourages people to destroy and burn schools religious places
houses and farms belong to turkish minority Then Greek government
forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them
You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never
happen Think about the war between Turkey and Greece in 
The river called SAKARYA flood  days filled with blood in 


 The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
 people They have never met me but they know I am bad person
 because I am from Turkey Politics is not my business and it is
 not the business of most of the Turks When it comes to individuals
 why the hatred

Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment
directly or indirecly is a bad person
It is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support
of the actions of your goverment that make you bad
People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you
are You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and
as a such you must pay the price


You mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the
government of Greece is a good person That is your Greek idea to
say Turks are bad people We know who we are and proud to be TURKS
anywhere in the world That is not Greeks business to tell us what
kind of people we are You are not at position to judge people because
you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities
Millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen
their rights are taken away from them and they have no voices under
the Government of Greece They are almost being treated as slaves
even though we are getting into th century Therefore do not make me
laught at you


 So that makes me think that there is some kind of
 brainwashing going on in Greece After all why would an educated person
 treat every person from a nation the same way can you tell me about your
 history books and things you learn about GreekTurkish
 encounters during your schooling
 take it easy

You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the TurksJust
as Greeks Arats Slavs Kurds and all other people who had
the luck to be under Turkish occupation
They will talk to you about murdersrapesdistruction
You do not learn about Turks from history books you learn about
them from people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness

The Government of Greece is actively supporting terrorism against
TurkeyArmenian and Kurdish terrorists have headquarters in Athens
They are being trained in special camps in Greece They are taught how to
kill innocent women and childrenThis not a claim this is a fact known
by whole world In conlusion you are in action to murder rape
destroy the innocent people I do not take you seriously because you
are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity
Your own government the Government of Greece actively supports
atrocities in Bosnia Serbs's Barbarism pleases your government
Please Napoleon think twice before you write anything about Turks and
Turkey You are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of
the minorities Who wants to be a fried with someone whose government
does not respect the human rights supports terrorism in Turkeybarbaric
actions in Bosnia treats Turkish minorities as third class citizen and
take away all of their rights treating them as slaves at the beginning
of th century

 Country Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
 KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan

Gimme a break  CAPITAL letters or NOT the above is pure nonsense  It
seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities
while hoping that Turkey will stay out  Stop and think for a moment
will you  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict it
is a part of it

The KARABAKHIARMENIANS who have lived
in their HOMELAND for  years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS
BY STALIN are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending
themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION

Huh  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
within their borders


 At last I hope that the US insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH
 crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again

You're not playing with a full deck are you  Where would Turkey invade
Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with scg in the header
in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun  Yes indeed Turkey
has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes she had however is
the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the
negotiating table  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri
towns  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the
futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that
leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's
going to cause incessant skirmishes  Think of  or  years down the
line  both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically
and neither one is going to wipe the other out  These people will be
neighbors would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal

If you belong to the Armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes
your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their
blood and future  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize
craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled  The Armenians
in Armenia and NK will be there with the same people you seem to hate
as their neighbors for maybe  years more  The sooner there's peace in
the region the better it is for them and everyone else  I'd push for
compromise if I were you instead of hitting the capslock and spreading
inflammatory halftruths

cheers

 There is a similar idea here in exUSSR about how many militioners it needs

DA Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan  It is Armenian
DA soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan

    Well this is your opinion 

    Turkish Azeris can BARK all they WANT since the ABOVE is UNTRUE However
    I am sure YOU GUYS would have NEVER brought up ARMENIA's involvement if
    KARABAKHIArmenians had had HEAVY losses


DA You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression
DA only in that region  It seems to me that the Armenians are better
DA organized have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns
DA repeatedly

	Read what  The New York Times  that is publishing antiarmenian
	articles Nop I have my resources Look everyone knows how aggressive
        TurksAzeris have been in the past Armenians ARE NOT gona sit
	around and watch FIRE WORKS by AZERIS taught by TURKS

DA It seems to me that the Armenians are better organized have more success
DA militarily and shell Azeri towns repeatedly

	Buch of nonsence CRAP and you know it Who the hell you think
        you are talking to  Azeris are FIGHTING LOCAL ARMENIANS in
	NagarnoKarabakh You tell me who has more MIG's  Freedom fighters
        in NagarnoKarabakh or Azerbaijan 

	Again I will say it for the last time ARMENIA is NOT involved
        in this WAR and you guys WANT to bring this up in order to cover
        up the Turkish involvment in the Karabakh Go ahead  REPEAT as
	much as you want

DA I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion  Turkey had the right to
DA intervene and it did  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to
DA last for so long but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both
DA on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed
DA for the ongoing standoff in the region

	Not a chance  You CAN NOT convince me based on your REASONSthat
	your GOVERNMENT did the RIGHT thing to invade CYPRUS

DA Lastly why is there not a socculturearmenia  I vote yes for it
DA After all it is now free

h 	The Armenians in NagarnoKarabagh are simply DEFENDING their RIGHTS
h        to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are INVADING their
h        territorium

HE	Homeland First NagarnoKarabagh was Armenians homeland today
HE	Fizuli Lacin and several villages in Azerbadjan
HE	are their homeland Can't you see the
HE	the  Great Armenia dream in this

Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh to the Black Sea to the
Mediterranean so if you use the term Greater Armenia use it with care

HE    With facist methods like
HE	killing raping and bombing villages The last move was the
HE	blast of a truck with  kurdish refugees trying to
HE	escape the from Lacin a city that was given to the Kurds
HE	by the Armenians

It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh
by removing the Armenians When the president of Azerbaijan Elchibey came to
power last year he announced he would be be swimming in Lake Sevan in
Armeniaxn by July Well he was wrong If Elchibey is going to shell the
Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam his people will pay the price If Elchibey
is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price If
Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of
Kelbajar his people will pay the price

It also seems other nonAzeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they
are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation Just
look at the situation with the Lezgians

About the Kurdswhat Kurds According to the Azerbaijani government there
are no Kurds in Azerbaijan Can't they make up their minds Oh I see there
are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds And anyway this 
Kurd refugee story as have other stories are simple fabrications sourced in
Baku modified in Ankara Other examples of this are Armenia has no border
with Iran and the ridiculous story of the intercepting of Armenian military
conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by
somebody unknown from Armenian into Azeri Turkish submitted by an unnamed
special correspondent to the NY Times from Baku Real accurate

h       However I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane
h       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
h       that happened last SUMMER Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
h       carrying humanitarian aid bound to ARMENIA
h

No Henrik these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked

HE	Don't speak about things you don't know  American Cargo planes
HE	were heading to Armenia When the Turkish authorities
HE	announced that they were going to search these cargo
HE	planes  of these planes returned to it's base in Germany
HE	 of these planes were searched in Turkey The content of
HE	of the other  planes Not hard to guess is it It was sure not
HE	humanitarian aid

Your facts in error Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey
have been either searched rerouted or confiscated Some American planes
were searched others were rerouted others were untouched Rail shipments
were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey
for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia Wheat was
confiscated other shipments were exchanged with crap and dirt then
shipped to Armenia US planes don't have to use Turkish air bases The US
uses these bases to bomb Iraq Anyway US planes can fly over Georgia which
they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish
chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed
anything other than a paranoid Turkish military

HE	Search Turkish planes You don't know what you are talking about
HE	since it's content is announced to be weapons

Well big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan
from Turkey yet Demirel and others say no No wonder you are so confused

HE	Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
HE	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
HE	it self not the Karabag province So why search a plane for weapons
HE	since it's content is announced to be weapons

You are correct all Turkish planes should be simply shot down Nice slow
moving air transports

I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and
Islam  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions Now Islam has turned against its father I may say
It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise
I thought the idea of believing on one God was to Unite all man kind How come both Jews and Islam which believe
on the same God the God of Ebrahim are killing each other Is this like Dr Frankenstien's story
How are you going to stop this from happening How are you going to deal with so many Muslims Nuking them
would distroy the whole world Would God get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same
God same heaven and the same hell after all What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga


Man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state
A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society
The praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it God does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes
that God will help him when he prays
Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life But the
religious leaders need to make a living through religion So they  may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to
make their living ie Muslims have to pay   percent of their income to the Mullahs I guess the rabie  gets his
cut too

Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other
helps one another respect the mother nature Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts
that we take today  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will
see the outcome of his choice  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion How can we stop
another religious killing field under poor Gods name What are your thoughts Do you think man kind would
to come its senses before it is too late


PS on the side

Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina Why would God go to top of the mountain He created
the earth he could have been anywhere why on top the mountain Was it because people thought to see God
you have to reach to the skiesheavens Why God kept coming back to Middle East Was it because they created
God through their imagination  Is that why Jewish people were told by God they were the chosen ones

Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh She was a Jewish She taught him how to trade She probably taught
him about Judaism Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah sp old testement Do you think God wrote Quran
Makeh was a trade city before Islam Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad
wanted to expand his trade business Is that why  God has put his house in there

I think this religious stuff has gone too far All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up
Look at David Koresh how that turned out I am afraid in the bigger scale the Jews and the Muslims will
have the same ending

Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than
plotting each others distruction  There is one earth One life and one God Let's all man kind be good toward
each other

God help us all
Peace

 Onur Yalcin Secondly the island of which the name is more correctly spelled
 Onur Yalcin as Cyprus has never been Greek but rather it has been home to
 Onur Yalcin a bicommunal society formed of Greeks and Turks It seems that
                
 Onur Yalcin you know as little about the history and the demography of the
 Onur Yalcin island as you know about the essence of Turkey's
 Onur Yalcin military intervention to it under international agreements

 	bicommunal society  Then why DID NOT Greece INVADE CYPRUS 

Henrik 

Your ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence I'm not
going to spend time to review with you the recent history of Cyprus If you are
really interested I can provide you with a number of references on the issue
Just send me EMail for that


 Onur Yalcin Be that as it may an analogy between an act of occupation in
 Onur Yalcin history and what is going on today on Azerbaijani land can only
 Onur Yalcin be drawn with the expansionist policy that Armenia is now
 pursuing

 	Buch of CRAP and you know it NagarnoKarabagh has ALWAYS been PART
         of ARMENIA and it was STALIN who GAVE IT to the AZERIS Go back and
         review the HISTORY

 	The Armenians in NagarnoKarabagh are simply DEFENDING their RIGHTS
         to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are INVADING their
         teritory

 Onur Yalcin But I could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to
 Onur Yalcin the political conduct of countries and promulgate them in such
 Onur Yalcin terminology as itchybitchy

        I was not the one that STATED IT


Relax You're swinging fists into open air I was agreeing with you
assuming that would be one of your points that you did not state You may
not be very much used to it to be agreed with  that is but take it more
easily  

        However I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane
        to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one

No Henrik believe me You don't hope that

        that happened last SUMMER Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
        carrying humanitarian aid bound to ARMENIA


Was that after or before one French plane changed its route to avoid
inspection

Ten Questions about arab countries


I would be thankful if any of you who live in arab countries could
help to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions
These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and
again by people around me

      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize
Israeli nationality   That people with Israeli stamps on their
passports can't enter arabic countries

      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria
have undefined borders and that arab governments from  until today
have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states
should be

      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical
weapon convention treaty in Paris in 

      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of
individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
state secrets 

a	Is it true that some arab countries like Syria harbor Nazi
war criminals and refuse to extradite them

b	Is it true that some arab countries like Saudi Arabia
prohibit women from driving cars

      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim
countries are subject to different laws than Muslims

      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of
entire Jewish communites forced to flee by antiJewish riots

      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister Y Rabin signed
a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign

      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a 
deposit before leaving the country and are no longer allowed to
emmigrate despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush

	 Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a
special tax for being Jews

     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built
on a Jewish cemetary with roads being paved over grave sites and
gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines

	Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased
leading questions

a	Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr
Davidsson's questions is highly misleading

 Ten questions to Israelis
 

 I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to
 provide
  accurate answers to the following specific questions These are
 indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
 people around me

       Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize
 Israeli nationality  And that ID cards which Israeli citizens
 must carry at all times identify people as Jews or Arabs not as
 Israelis 


Although the Hebrew expression LE'UM is used the ID card specifically states on
the nd page EZRACHUT YISREALIT Israeli citizen This is true for all
Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity In the United States most
official forms have RACE Caucasian Black AmerIndian etc


       Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders
 and that Israeli governments from  until today have refused to
 state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be
 


Funny I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders



       Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons  If so
 could you provide any evidence 

Probably yes So what 




       Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of
 individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
 identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
 state secrets 


Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors there was one
other espionage case the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological
Institute who was a KGB mole who was tried in camera I wouldn't exactly
call it a state secret The trial was simply tried behind closed doors I hate
to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases
in camera



       Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied
 territories are subject to different laws than nonJews


Not Jews Israeli citizens Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the
KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens
residing in the West Bank These citizens could be Jews Israeli Muslims Druze
or Israeli Christians It has NOTHING to do with religion




       Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 
 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return while their
 Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return 

Anyone who was registered Jew Muslim Christian could return You might be
confusing this with the census taken in June  on the West Bank after the
Six Day War In this instance if the Arab was not physically present he
couldn't reside on the West Bank eg if he had been visting Jordan



       Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister Y Rabin signed
 an order for ethnical cleansing in  as is done today in
 BosniaHerzegovina 


No Not even if you drowned him in bourbon scotch or brandy 



       Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as
 members in kibbutzim

Not true Although a minority there are some Israeli Arabs living on
kibbutzim On the other hand at my age  I wouldn't be admitted to a
kibbutz nor could the family join me Not that I would be so thrilled to do so
in the first place The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous
membership criteria Many Israeli Jews are not admitted



       Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage
 marriages between Jews and nonJews 

The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the
religious courts The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews the
Muslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims the Christian denominations have their
religious courts and the Druze have their own courts The entire religious
establishment Jewish Muslim Druze Christian wants to keep it that way


      Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the
 site of a muslim cemetery 

I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary From what I heard and I'd
like to get feedback from Muslins  on the net sanctity of cemetaries is not
held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews The current Israeli Ministry of
Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that
was built by Arabs in the 's on the site of an Arab cemetary

henrik  Country Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
henrik  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan

BM Gimme a break  CAPITAL letters or NOT the above is pure nonsense  It
BM seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities
		     
     Again Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves What do
     want them to do Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them

BM while hoping that Turkey will stay out  Stop and think for a moment
BM will you  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict it
BM is a part of it

Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged
training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHIArmenians

henrik The KARABAKHIARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 
henrik years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN are the
henrik ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending
henrik themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION

BM  Huh  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
BM  within their borders

	Well history is SAD Remember those are relocated Azeris into
        the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime

henrik At last I hope that the US insists that Turkey stay out of the
henrik KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER
henrik OCCUR again

BM You're not playing with a full deck are you  Where would Turkey invade

   It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped
   into Armenia if SHE could

BM Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with scg in the header
BM in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun

	Absolutely NOT  I am merely trying to emphasize that in many
        cases HISTORY repeats itself

BM Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes
BM she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring
BM the parties to the negotiating table  That's hard to do when Armenians
BM are attacking Azeri towns

	So let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying Turkey
        wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT NOT 

	I will believe it when I see it

	Now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a GUN pointing
        to your HEAD  Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yourseffat chance
	Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU  All the
	BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN I mean
	BURNING people ALIVE 

BM Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the
BM futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that
BM leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's
BM going to cause incessant skirmishes

	Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic They are
        NOT asking much They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY
	from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN

BM Think of  or  years down the line  both of the newly independent
BM countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe
BM the other out   These people will be neighbors would it not be better
BM to keep the bad blood between them minimal

	Don't get me WRONG I also want PEACEFUL solution to the
	conflict But until Azeris realize that the Armenians in
	KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion

BM If you belong to the Armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes
BM your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of
BM their blood and future

	Again you are taking different TURNS Armenia HAS no intension
        to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan The Armenians in KARABAKH
        are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET

BM It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize
BM craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled  The Armenians
BM in Armenia and NK will be there with the same people you seem to hate
BM as their neighbors for maybe  years more  The sooner there's peace in
BM the region the better it is for them and everyone else  I'd push for
BM compromise if I were you instead of hitting the capslock and spreading
BM inflammatory halftruths

	It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative I am absolutely
        for it But in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself
        you will be WIPED out Such as the case in the era of  of
	The Armenian Massacres

 Typical Arabic thinking  If we are guilty of something so is
 everyone else  Unfortunately for you Nabil Jewish tribes are not
 nearly as susceptible to the fratricidal murdering that is still so
 common among Arabs in the Middle East  There were no  killings
 between the Jewish tribes on the way

I don't like this comment about Typical thinking You could state
your interpretation of Exodus without it As I read Exodus I can see
a lot of killing there which is painted by the author of the bible
in ideologicalreligious colors The history in the desert can be seen
as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land That's why I think
it is a great book with which descendants Arabs Turks and Mongols can
unify as well

You somehow missed Nabil's comments even though you included it in
your followup

  The number which could have arrived to the Holy Lands must have been
  substantially less ude to the harsh desert and the killings between the
  Jewish tribes on the way

I am not aware of killings between Jewish tribes in the desert

The point of typical thinking here is that while Arabs STILL TODAY
act in the manner you describe like any nomadic people occupying a
land killing and plundering each other with regularity others have
somehow progressed over time  It is not surprising then that Arabs
often accuse others infidels of things that they are quite familiar
with civil rights violations religious discrimination ethnic
cleansing land theft torture and murder  It is precisely this
mechanism at work that leads people to say that Jewish tribes were
killing each other in the desert even without support for such a
ludicrous suggestion

Come on  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war
against Israel

I wouldn't bet on it

Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and
their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home
They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control
because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis  The
Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan
liked it  and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands
per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan  The governments of
Syria Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly  However proclaiming
public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects
criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to
even the most brutal Arab tyrants

Arab PEOPLE probably aren't much more sympathetic  Palestineans
have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan
Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere

You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel but I
suspect that many Arabs far removed from the immediate border with
Israel eg in Kuwait or Morroco couldn't care less

Some of your article was cut off on the right margin but I will try
and answer from what I can read

In article CssqEDpsodincorpsgicom kavehgatekoicorpsgicom Kaveh Smith  writes
I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and
Islam  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions Now Islam has turned against its father I may say
It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise
I thought the idea of believing on one God was to Unite all man kind How come both Jews and Islam which believe
on the same God the God of Ebrahim are killing each other Is this like Dr Frankenstien's story
How are you going to stop this from happening How are you going to deal with so many Muslims Nuking them
would distroy the whole world Would God get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same
God same heaven and the same hell after all What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga

Judaism did not father Islam  We had many of the same prophets but
Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ who
Christians and Muslims believe in and Mohammed  The idea of believing
in one God should unite all peoples  However note that Christianity
and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views
and the rights of nonChristians and nonMuslims are stated in each
religion


Man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state
A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society
The praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it God does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes
that God will help him when he prays
Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life But the
religious leaders need to make a living through religion So they  may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to
make their living ie Muslims have to pay   percent of their income to the Mullahs I guess the rabie  gets his
cut too

We are supposed to pay  of our income after all necessities are
paid  Please note that this  is on a personal basis  if you are
poor there is no need to pay quite the contrary this money most
often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims
around the world  Also this money is not required in the human
sense ie a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money
and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid
and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer
services

Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other
helps one another respect the mother nature Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts
that we take today  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will
see the outcome of his choice  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion How can we stop
another religious killing field under poor Gods name What are your thoughts Do you think man kind would
to come its senses before it is too late


PS on the side

Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina Why would God go to top of the mountain He created
the earth he could have been anywhere why on top the mountain Was it because people thought to see God
you have to reach to the skiesheavens Why God kept coming back to Middle East Was it because they created
God through their imagination  Is that why Jewish people were told by God they were the chosen ones

God's presence is certainly on Earth but since God is everywhere
God may show signs of existence in other places as well  We can not
say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where
he has not

Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh She was a Jewish She taught him how to trade She probably taught
him about Judaism Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah sp old testement Do you think God wrote Quran
Makeh was a trade city before Islam Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad
wanted to expand his trade business Is that why  God has put his house in there

The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah  Muslims believe that
the Taurah the Bible and the Qur'an originally contained much the same
message thus the many similiarities  However the Taurah and the
Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed
their meaning over time a translation also reflects some of the
personal views of the translators  The Qur'an still exists in the
same language that it was revealed in  Arabic  Therefore we know
that mankind has not changed its meaning  It is truly what was revealed
to Mohammed at that time  There are many scientific facts which
were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later
such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb


I think this religious stuff has gone too far All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up
Look at David Koresh how that turned out I am afraid in the bigger scale the Jews and the Muslims will
have the same ending

Only God knows for sure how it will turn out  I hope it won't but if
that happens it was the will of God

Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than
plotting each others distruction  There is one earth One life and one God Let's all man kind be good toward
each other

God help us all
Peace


Please send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what
you said  And yes may God help us all

Steve

Even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would
be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '  If there'd been

time everybody would have stayed home with their families  I have no
wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel but I suspect what I've said is not
only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved

BM Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes
BM she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring
BM the parties to the negotiating table  That's hard to do when Armenians
BM are attacking Azeri towns

henrik	   So let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying Turkey
henrik	   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT NOT 

So what do you think we want  War death and destruction

henrik	   I will believe it when I see it

No if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it

henrik  Now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a GUN pointing
henrikto your HEAD  Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yourseffat chance

This kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing

henrik  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU  All the
henrik  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN I mean
henrik  BURNING people ALIVE 

Now some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff
perpetrated by Armenians  One should rehash stuff like this often to
keep the hatred alive right

BM Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the
BMfutility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that
BM leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's
BM going to cause incessant skirmishes

henrik	   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic They are
henrik	   NOT asking much They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY
henrik	   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN

Well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods
of asking not very peaceful I'd say

BM Think of  or  years down the line  both of the newly independent
BM countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe
BM the other out   These people will be neighbors would it not be better
BM to keep the bad blood between them minimal

henrik	   Don't get me WRONG I also want PEACEFUL solution to the
henrik	   conflict But until Azeris realize that the Armenians in
henrik	   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion

I don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans
Peace isn't what's happening right now furthermore what's happening
right now isn't condusive to peace  You can spend days and nights
raving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure
there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other
side  If entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace
than they should sit down and talk about a compromise  Armenia isn't
strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right and we have the
bombs so we'll do whatever we want so there' style of foreign
relations  Yes you can type Stalin in caps and give one sided
atrocity stories etc but for peace you need to be willing to talk to
the other side  You personally can choose not to do that of course
this being just USENET  The people in power shouldn't be so childish


BM If you belong to the Armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes
BM your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of
BM their blood and future

henrik	   Again you are taking different TURNS Armenia HAS no intension
henrik	   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan The Armenians in KARABAKH
henrik	   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET

Azeri's would disagree with you on this and the maps I've seen support
what they'd be saying  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be
reached in this manner

BM It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize
BM craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled  The Armenians
BM in Armenia and NK will be there with the same people you seem to hate
BM as their neighbors for maybe  years more  The sooner there's peace in
BM the region the better it is for them and everyone else  I'd push for
BM compromise if I were you instead of hitting the capslock and spreading
BM inflammatory halftruths

henrik   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative I am absolutely
henrik   for it

It didn't look it when I read your posting  It would seem to me
that if you can spew misinformation about a boogeyman you can also
talk about how one might avoid the nastiness  Fair

henrik But in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself
henrik you will be WIPED out Such as the case in the era of  of
henrik The Armenian Massacres

You don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres'
Yes boys and girls let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were
Let's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger and let's do that so our
kids will also be hateful  Sounds crazy doesn't it  Don't do it then

because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the
Israeli ecconomy any more There is no money for such an occupation


Don't fool yourself It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the
negotiating table Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else



Phill HallamBaker

Oh why do you expose your ignorance  The US has been running on debt for
the past four generations and has still financed what it pleases

The US unlike Israel has massive capital assets to wit fort Knox for
one The accumulated assets of the British empire shiped over in bulk
to pay for our weapons bill in world war I Or maybe you thought that the
US occupied the Boer republic that is now South Africa


And after the Gulf War Israel could do whatever it wanted after
not decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks  It was encouraged but
by no means forced to negotiate

Not with Bush at the helm The gulf war meant that the middle east
was no longer a fringe issue of US politics The US people had to
be convinced that the US could keep everything hunky dory in that
region

You realise of course that all this is purely in the interests of allowing
the US citizen to drive arround in a  litre car doing single digit
miles to the gallon Were the US to act responsibly they cvould be
self sufficient in oil


Mr Baker to address all of your points would be impossible but in a
nutshell it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in
Lebanon without attacking Syria  Syrian occupation has been hostile
and amounts to annexation

Syrian occupation ended the civil war Israeli invasion worstened it

Its a bit like the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia reprehensible but
it put an end to the far worse attrocity that preceeded it Now Syria
is in the US camp there might even be a possibility of some sort of
democratisation

What do you expect from an ex French colony They made a pigs ear of
every single one The British cocked up Palestine and Pakistan most
of the others managed to avoid a bloodbath Compared to Algeria Syria
had it easy


 Israel's is clearly defensive  If it

Clearly offensive in that the original intent was to disloge the PLO from
Lebanon In the process the civil war was dramatically worsened


were not defensive you would see all of Lebanon occupied and governed by
Israel  But that is not what Israel wants

Not at all Israel is not in Lebanon because to do that would have meant
tens of thousands of dead Had the US not stopped the Likud nutters from
continuing they would have seriously have threatened Israels survival
Even in New York there was a massive feeling of revulsion for the Israeli
invasion It was a complete disaster in PR terms

 In article ApryumaACNSColoStateEDU bhlancecolostateedu writes
 
 It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like
 to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
 in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc
 SOME young men usually aged between  to  years are members of
 the Lebanese resistance  Even the inhabitants of the village do not
 know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often
 suspect who they are and what they are up to  These young men are
 supported financially by Iran most of the time  They sneak arms and
 ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
 for Israeli patrols  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
 by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
 of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians

 This a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups
 to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the
 opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or
 in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search Certainly the
 people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the
 innocent civilians into harm's way

 Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover Israel
 should totally back down Sothe easiest way to get away with attacking
 another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
 innocent lives

Tell me Tim what are these guerillas doing wrong Assuming that they are using
civilians for cover are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country If the
buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel is it not working Why is it
further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages Why not just
kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone You see there is more to
the shelling of the villages it is called RETALIATION GETTING BACK
GETTING EVEN It doesn't make sense to shell the villages The least
it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of
civilians


 If Israel insists that
 the so called Security Zone is necessary for the protection of
 Northern Israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation
 with the blood of its soldiers

 If Israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from OUR land

 What So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states
 can start all over again While I also hope for this to happen it will
 only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are prepared to take on the
 responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their
 soil They have to Prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way
 Israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of
 tolerance towards antiIsrael guerillas inresidence

If Israel is not willing to accept the word of others then IMHO it has
no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks

 
 I have written before on this very newsgroup that the only
 real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace
 settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and
 peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure
 no one on either side of the border is shelled

 Good lord Brad 

No I am not Basil I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I
respect what he writes Basil is a person that I would gladly call
a friend He is however not me Nor am I Lebanese as some seem to
suspect

 This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to
 realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting
 its northern cities has failed  In fact it has caused much more
 Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
 would have resulted in

 Perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is
 the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting
 against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently
 accept our fate Ifhowever you call on Israel to see the sense of
 suffering fewer casualties I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian
 Arab and Islamic groups

Tim you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been
disarmed Hezbollah remains the only independent militia Hezbollah does
not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up
Sheikh Mosavi his wife and young son Of course if Israel would withdraw
from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't
make the Lebanese so mad as to do that Furthermore with Hezbollah
subsequently disarmed it would not be possible

 and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
 capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
 in all other parts of Lebanon
 
 Basil

 It has not Without the support and active involvement of Syria
 Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred
 Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain
 control If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel

Tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border
Not lately eh

Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use
territory under their control to attack Israel While Lebanon would be better
off with Syria and Israel out of its borders the presence of Syrian troops
in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory not on
Israeli troops in Lebanon however Please note the distinction in the
past two years

 
 Tim

 Your view of this entire matter is far too serenely onesided and
 selectively naive

I disagree Basil has always seemed to me to be a coolheaded person slow
to anger certainly more so than I What is most important is that he is an
actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns If only the
Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were
reversed perhaps they would moderate their retaliation

  Well Panos Mr Tamamidis the way you put it it is only the Turks
  who bear the responsibility of the things happening today That is hard to
  believe for somebody trying to be objective
  When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
  blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides
  What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW anyway
  Do you think it was your right to be there

 There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor until 
 Someone had to protect them If not us who

  I am not saying that conflicts started with that It is only
  not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
  It is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
  I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
  visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey I thought it
  was a positive attempt to make the relations better
 
 Compromise on what the invasion of Cyprus the involment of Turkey in
 Greek politics the refusal of Turkey to accept  miles of territorial
 waters as stated by international law the properties of the Greeks of
 Konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the Greek lakesorry Aegean

 There are some things on which there can not be a compromise


  The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
  people They have never met me but they know I am bad person
  because I am from Turkey Politics is not my business and it is
  not the business of most of the Turks When it comes to individuals
  why the hatred

 Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or
 indirecly is a bad person
 It is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support of the
 actions of your goverment that make you bad
 People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you
 are You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and
 as a such you must pay the price

  So that makes me think that there is some kind of
  brainwashing going on in Greece After all why would an educated person
  treat every person from a nation the same way can you tell me about your
  history books and things you learn about GreekTurkish
  encounters during your schooling
  take it easy

 You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks Just talk to

 You do not learn about Turks from history books you learn about them from
 people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness

on the world First of all you didn't answer the question I asked

BTW does the Litani River not flow West and not South I think that its waters

Sorry ARF  you dog

That news was suppressed because the Israeli national volleyball team
repeatedly spiked it

Let this be a lesson to others not to invoke the wrath of sports nuts
Brits lead the way in this regard with  casualties in the last 
years

Anyway Yigal would never sue  His life is presumably so pristine
that its most intimate details could be revealed without harm to
anyone  Might even be good instruction for some people I can think of

Me I would sue  I hate the way sports dominates the media
Anyway the last  ADL agents watching me die of boredom before filing
their reports  I've damaged their Atlanta operation something fierce

 It seems that President Clinton can recognize Jerusalem as Israels capitol
 while still keeping his diplomatic rear door open by stating that the Parties
 concerned should decide the city's final status Even as I endorse Clintons vie
 w of course it is definitely a matter to be decided upon by Israel and
 other participating neighboring contries
 I see no real conflict in stating both views nor expect any better from
 politicians

I was trying to avoid a discussion of the whether Clintons views
should be endorsed or not  All I was trying to find out was
whether the newspaper article was correct in making these
statements about the President by obtaining some information
about when and where he made these statements

Thank you

In article Aprnewsuiowaedu mauherkycsuiowaedu Mau Napoleon writes

Instabul was called Konstantinoupolis from  AD until about the s
That's about  years There many people alive today who were born in
a city called Konstantinoupolis

I know it doesn't make sense but since when is 'Napoleon' about
sense anyway Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of
certain Greeks still exists in our day Most Greeks insist even
today that the  yearold capital of the Ottoman Empire should
be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul but by its half
a millenniumold moniker 'Conswhatever'

Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'
but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today The name
of Stalingrad too is long gone replaced by Volgagrad China's
Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago Ciudad Trujillo
of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo Zimbabve's
old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare These changes
have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world

But Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul
by the name of 'Cons'

How can one explain this total intransigence What makes Greeks
so different from other mortals yearold questionable
democracy Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact
for instance that Istanbul changed hands  years ago in
 AD and that this predates the discovery of the New
World by  years The declaration of US independence
in  will come  years later

Shouldn't then half a millennium be considered enough time for
'Cons' to be called a Turkish city Where is the logic in the
Greek reasoning if there is any How long can one sit on the
laurels of an ancient civilization Ancient Greece does not exist
any more than any other  civilizations that existed on the soil
of Anatolia

These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion It
is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize
that Cyprus is a Greek Island No history book shows
that it ever was It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock
stock and barrel' for a period of well over  years

In fact prior to the Turks' acquisition of it following
bloody naval battles with the Venetians in  AD the
island of Cyprus belonged invariably to several nations

The Assyrians the Sumerians the Phoenicians the Egyptians
the Ottoman Turks of course in that order owned it as
their territory But it has never been the possession
of the government of Greece  not even for one day 
in the history of the world Moreover Cyprus is
located  miles from the Greek mainland but only
 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline

Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi
territory and the Greek Cypriot government and
the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus
also was once part of the Greek hegemony

Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination
should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront
reality Again wishful thinking is unproductive only
facts count

As for Selanik

  Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled
  particularly to Salonica whose Jewish population increased substantially
  as a result from  in  to  in  more than half the
  total population though even there increased persecution by local Greeks
  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire particularly to
  the great port of Izmir

  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike the ritual
  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on Greek
  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 
  and  following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War
  when many of its Jews were either killed or terrorized into leaving

  Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow
  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to
  practice their religions without hindrance a law was issued in 
  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday stimulating a new
  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do Between  and  there was a
  series of antiSemitic riots in Salonica with the Cambel quarter where
  most of the remaining Jews lived being burned to the ground This
  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting
  Hebrew and JudeaSpanish in the Jewish schools A start was made also
  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica
  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out  By
  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews the Greeks left a
  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time and starting
  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the
  occupation of Greece starting in 

  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for
  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence
  Istanbul Edirne and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received
  thousands more Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by
  the government of the Sultan Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in
  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained
  independence or expanded The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the
  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century and particularly during
  and after the Crimean War combined with the same independence movements
  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among
  its Jews caused thousands of helpless ill and povertystricken Muslim
  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the
  Ottoman Empire with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly
  to house and feed them as best it could From  to  as many as
   Crimean Tatars Circassians and other Muslims from north and
  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone as many as  more
  came during the next twenty years while  refugees entered in 
   as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states
  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the
  Empire

  So did the Turks kill the Armenians

So did the Jews kill the Germans
You even make Armenians laugh

An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the
 systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of
 the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at
 least  percent of the population of that republic The
 memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and
 eyewitnessed these atrocities was published in the US in
  with the title 'Men Are Like That' Other references abound

The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over  square miles The estimated population
 of the entire region in  was  of whom   percent were
 Armenian   percent Georgian and   percent Moslem
 Of the latter group  were Tatars Paradoxically barely onethird
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds Erevan
 uezd the administrative center of the province had only  Armenians
 as compared to  Moslems By the time of the Russian Census of 
 however the Armenians had established a scant majority  percent in the
 guberniia it had risen by  to  percent or  of the 
 inhabitants This impressive change in the province's ethnic character
 notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian
 Republic a solid block of  Tartars who continued to dominate the
 southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia
 See also Map  Historic Armenia and Map  Administrative subdivisions of
 Transcaucasia

In  '' percent Turk

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work
 of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village
 Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets
 completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border
 into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of
 Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the
 scattered bones of the dead

At last I hope that the US insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH
crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again

Do you have a terminal cold Karabag is 'Turkish' and will remain
'Turkish' Here we are almost at the end of the th century and
a whole community the Azeri Turks of xSoviet Armenia and Karabag
is facing forced assimilation torture and murder on one hand and
forced exodus expulsion and genocide on the other all because
of their ethnic and religious background And one should ask herself
is the world community really so powerless Where are all those human
rights advocates Where are all the decent people Are we going to
let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it The number
of Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage
gangs is increasing On the one hand they wish to distort the truth
and on the other they beg mercy from Turkiye

        The AgeMelbourne

        By Helen WOMACK   Agdam Azerbaijan Thursday

        The exact number of victims is still unclear  but there can be
        little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian
        fighters in the snowy mountains of NagornoKarabakh last week

        Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly  sheltering in  the
        Azeri border town of Agdam give largely consistent accounts of
        how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  
        February    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the
        surrounding forests Yesterday I saw   freshly dug graves in
        one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were
        shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday I
        also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift
        hospital in a string of railway carriages

        Khojaly an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by
        Armenians  had a population of about  Mr  Rashid Mamedov
        Commander of Police in Agdam  said  only about   escaped to
        his  town    So where are the rest  Some might have  taken
        prisoner he said or fled Many bodies were still lying in the
        mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to
        retrieve them He believed more than  had perished some of
        cold in temperatures as low as minus  degrees

        One  refugee  Rami Nasiru  described how Khojaly residents at
        first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting
        to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict
        But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored
        personnel carriers they realised they could not hope to defend
        themselves  with  machineguns and grenades  and fled into  the
        forests In the small hours the massacre started

        Mr  Nasiru  who believes his wife and two children were taken
        prisoner   repeated what many other refugees have said   that
        troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack
        Khojaly It is not my opinion I saw it with my own eyes

DA Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan  It is Armenian
DA soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan

    Well this is your opinion 

Are you related to 'Arromdian' of ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism
Triangle If you feel that you can simply act as a fascist Armenian
governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly
embarrassed This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist
and a genocide apologist but a fact This time fascist xSoviet Armenian
Government will not get away with the genocide of  Azeri men women
and children Not a chance


 The SUNDAY TIMES  March 

 Morgues fill as Azeris head for allout war
 

 Thomas Goltz the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in
 the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union reports from
 Agdam
 

 Khojaly used to be a barren town with empty shops and treeless dirt
 roads Yet it was still home to thousands of people who in happier
 times tended fields and flocks of geese Last week it was wiped off
 the map

 

 As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of
 Agdam and the bodies piled up in the morgues there was little doubt
 that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been
 the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke
 apart
 

 I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly That was in january and
 people were predicting their fate with grim resignation Zumrut Ezoya
 a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the
 town called her community sitting ducks ready to get shot She and
 her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 
 

 The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages one by one and
 the government does nothing Balakisi Sakikov  a father of five
 said Next they will drive us out or kill us all said Dilbar his
 wife The couple their three sons and three daughters were killed in
 the assault as were many other people I had spoken to
 

 It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross
 There was a road and the first units of the column ran across then
 all hell broke loose Bullets were raining down from all sides we had
 just entered their trap

 The azeri defenders picked off one by one Survivors say that Armenian
 forces then began a pitiless slaughter firing at anything moved in
 the gullies A video taken by an azeri cameraman wailing and crying
 as he filmed body after body showed a grizzly trail of death leading
 towards higher forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge
 from the Armenians

 The Armenians just shot and shot and shot said Omar Veyselov lying
 in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds I saw my wife and
 daughter fall right by me

 People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the
 loved ones Some vented their fury on foreigners  Where is my
 daughter where is my son  wailed a mother Raped Butchered Lost

 Azerbaijan has said as many as  refugees were killed as they
 tried to flee The Armenians have denied this saying the civilians
 were caught in crossfire

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH

ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO
INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS

As we swooped low over the snowcovered hills of NagornoKarabagh we saw
the scattered corpses Apparently the refugees had been shot down as
they ran An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over shown to
journalists afterwards showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts
of the hills

The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS  have died in a MASS KILLING
of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly seized by Armenians
last week A further  are believed to be wounded frozen to death
or missing

Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M attack helicopter
as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings Suddenly there
was a thump against the underside of the aircraft a red flash of tracer
ripped past the starboard wing and the helicopter rocked sharply We
swung round and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon
under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire

We had been fired on from an Armenian antiaircraft post We swung round
again tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a
valley The brown earth swooped around our heads the helicopter swung
round again and followed the contours of the ground Our cannon fired
repeated blasts

Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting
had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed
enclave of NagornoKarabakh to pick up some of the dead We had in
fact been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter
I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window
its cannons firing but had thought  mistakenly  that it was on
our side Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a
searchandrescue flight that had become a combat mission

Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two
M Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service nicknamed
flying crocodiles for their armour Our party was in the second
crocodile The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains
and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings The attack helicopters
were there to give covering fire if necessary

The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet
armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer An Azerbaijani
official told us that there were now five former Soviet military
helicopters and their pilots fighting for Azerbaijan They have
signed contracts to fly for us he said The helicopter we engaged
in combat was most probably flown by a brotherofficer of our Russian
pilot but fighting for the Armenians

We had taken off just before pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield an
heated for the Armeniancontrolled mountains of Karabakh a sheer
white wall in the distance The civilian helicopter picked up four
corpses and it was during this and a previous mission that an
Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies
on the hillsides We then took off again in a hurry and speed back
towards Azerbaijani lines Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before
the plain  and safety  gazed up at us as we passed

Back at the airfield in Agdam we took a look the bodies the
civilian helicopter had picked up Two old men a small girl were
covered with blood their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor
mortis They had been shot

What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy our close shave
and the war in NagornoKarabakh He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN POLITELY
DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER

 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the EmpireLeaving Erivan
 on April   Armenian volunteers reached Van on May  and organized
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during

 southern side of the lake


Source World Alive A Personal Story by Robert Dunn Crown Publishers
Inc New York 
Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 
 million Muslim people

p  seventh paragraph and p  first paragraph

 'The most are inside houses Come you and look'
 'No dammit My stomach isn't'
 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform Him you must see'
 We were under those trees by the mosque in an open space
 'I don't believe you I said but followed to a nailstudded door The
  man pushed it ajar then spurred away leaving me to check on the corpse
  I thought I should this charge was so constant so gritted my teeth and
  went inside

 The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes and was dark at first for
 its stone walls had only window slits Rags strewed the mud floor around an
 iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black
 with soot All looked bare and empty but in an inner room flies buzzed As
 the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face
 up naked but for its grimy turban He was about fifty years old by what
 was left of his face  a rifle butt had bashed an eye The one left slanted
 as with Tartars rather than with Turks Any uniform once on him was gone so
 I'd no proof which he was and quickly went out gagging at the mess of his
 slashed genitals

p  first paragraph

 'How many people lived there'
 'Oh about eight hundred' He yawned
 'Did you see any Turk officers'
 'No sir I was in at dawn All were Tartar civilians in mufti'

 The lieutenant dozed off then I but in the small hours a voice woke me 
 Dro's He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer Anyone keelhauled
 so long and furiously I'd never heard Then abruptly Dro broke into
 laughter quick and simple as child's Both were a cover for his sense
 of guilt I thought or hoped For somehow despite my boast of irreligion
 Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
 have been

 From daybreak on Armenian villagers poured in from miles around
 The women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over
 the carcass of Djul They hauled out every hovel's chattels the last
 scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags
 looms even spinningwheels

 'Thank you for a lot Dro' I said to him back in camp 'But now I must
 leave'We shook hands the captain said 'A bientot mon camarade' And
 for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains
 Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in
 a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran'

p 

At morning tea Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
 high region called the Karabakh Deep in tactics they spoke Russian
 but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
 of promises made by tribal chiefs A campaign shaped more raids on
 Moslem villages

p 

It will be three hours to take Dro told me We'd close in on three
 sides
The men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets Merrimanov
said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow
That is for morale Dro put in We must keep the Moslems in terror
Soldiers or civilians I asked
There is no difference said Dro All are armed in uniform or not
But the women and children
Will fly with the others as best they may

p 

The ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still Hundreds of feet
 down the fog held solid as cotton flock 'Djul lies under that' said
 Dro pointing 'Our men also attack from the other sides'

 Then 'Wheeee'  his whistle lined up all at the rock edge Bayonets
 clicked upon carbines Over plunged Archo his black haunches rippling
 then followed the staff the horde  nose to tail bellies taking the
 spur Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though
 I heard our Utica brass roar

 As I watched from the height it took ages for Djul to show clear A tsing
 of machinegun fire took over from the thumping batteries cattle lowed
 dogs barked invisible while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
 puddle Mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly
 The came a shrill wailing

 Now among the cloudstreaks rose darker wisps  smoke Red glimmered about
 house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs A mosque stood in
 clump of trees thick and green Through crooked alleys on fire horsemen
 were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot

 'Tartarski' shouted the gunner by me Others pantomimed them in escape
 over the rocks while one twisted a bronze shellnose loaded and yanked
 breechcord firing again and again Shots wasted I thought when by
 afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body But these shots and
 the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries

 At length all shooting petered out I got on my horse and rode down toward
 Djul It burned still but little flame showed now The way was steep and
 tough through dense scrub Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly
 through alders on smoldering houses Across trampled wheat my brothersin
 arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb

p  fourth paragraph

Corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair
 large eyes She looked about twelve years old She lay in some stubble
 where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting The bayonet
 had gone through her back I judged for blood around was scant Between
 the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun
 dress

 The next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and kneepants He
 lay face down in the path by several huts One arm reached out to the
 pewter bowl he'd carried now upset upon its dough Steel had jabbed
 just below his neck into the spine

 There were grownups too I saw as I led the sorrel around Djul was
 empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's Germanspeaking
 colonel He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead

p

 Russians but were attacking the Moslem folk in the region as well

    Well this is your opinion 


Of course it is

    Turkish Azeris can BARK all they WANT since the ABOVE is UNTRUE However
    I am sure YOU GUYS would have NEVER brought up ARMENIA's involvement if
    KARABAKHIArmenians had had HEAVY losses


And this is your opinion  It is not any more valid due to repeated
capital letters and words such as 'untrue' 'never' etc

	Read what  The New York Times  that is publishing antiarmenian
	articles Nop I have my resources Look everyone knows how aggressive
        TurksAzeris have been in the past Armenians ARE NOT gona sit
	around and watch FIRE WORKS by AZERIS taught by TURKS

So Armenians are justified in aggression since supposedly Turks have
been aggressive in the past  I don't follow your logic

DA I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion  Turkey had the right to

	Not a chance  You CAN NOT convince me based on your REASONSthat
	your GOVERNMENT did the RIGHT thing to invade CYPRUS

I have said that I don't wish to get into Cyprus discussion and did not
give any reasons for Turkey's involvement  I also am not trying to
convince you of anything seeing no reason to waste any time

DA Lastly why is there not a socculturearmenia  I vote yes for it
DA After all it is now free

	Well I am NOT in the position to agree or disadree with you



I am serious  Let's get socculturearmenia started and have some peace

I know this paper well and see it for the exercise in selective morality
and judgement it is Until such time as it recognizes that any religiously
based government is racist exclusionary and simply built on a philosophy
of separate but equal secondclass treatment of minorities it will
continue to be known for its bias If Jewish nationalism is racism so is
Islam anywhere where people are allotted different rights according to
race religion or culture is racist

I flipped on my local Cable Access Channel a channel where any
community member can broadcast whatever they want for about 
per half hour and saw a documentary I use this term loosely
on the conflict in the West Bank

It was apparently made with a hand held camcorder the quality was
terrible and the camera was really jumpy  The documentary sic
told the tales of all of the children who died in the war against
the Jews as martyrs

It was a regular sob story  One victimized youth was recounting
on how all he really wants to do is to get an education and that
the big bad Jews won't let him go to high school  He admittedly
spent  years in prison age  to  for murdering a Jewish woman
but claims that it was for the cause

I have seen this kind of garbage before  I have a lot of sympathy for
the Palestinian cause as do many Jews but I think that even many
Arabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary

The most suprising part is that the only credits shown at the end
was an address for the makers of the film named JEWISH COMM ON
THE MIDDLE EAST

Anybody heard of them  They make Peace Now look like rightwingers

Yes Israel has nuclear weapons However

 They are locked in the cellar of the Garinei Afula factory and since

 Even if the Gingi finds the key the chief Rabbis have a time lock

   Resident at Building  Apartment 
   Block 
   Sumgait Azerbaijan


During the first days of the events the th and the th of February I
was away on a business trip On the th I had got my crew done the paper
work and left for the Zhdanov District That's in Azerbaijan near the
Nagorno Karabagh region

After the th rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh specifically
in Stepanakert an uprising had taken place They said uprising in
Azerbaijani but I don't think it was really an uprising just a
demonstration After that the unrest started Several Armenians living in the
Zhdanov District were injured How were they injured They were beaten even
women it was said that they were at the demonstrations but they live here
and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate After that I felt uneasy There
were some conversations about Armenians among the local population the
Armenians had done this the Armenians had done that Right there at the site
I was attacked a couple of times by kids Well true the guys from my crew
wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives After that I felt really
bad I didn't know where to go I up and called home And my children tell me
There's unrest everywhere be careful Well I had a project going on I told
the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on
and said I wanted to take my crew off the site They wouldn't allow it they
said Nothing's going to happen to you we've entrusted the matter to the
police we've warned everyone in the district nothing will happen to you
Well in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me he
knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened This
man didn't leave me alone for five minutes he was at work the whole time and
afterward he spent the night with us too

I sense some disquiet and call home my wife also tells me The situation is
very tense be careful

We finished the job at the site and I left for Sumgait first thing on the
morning of the th When we left the guys warned me they told me that I
shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian I took someone else's
business travel documents in the name of Zardali and hid my own I hid it
and my passport in my socks We set out for Baku Our guys were on the bus
they sat behind and I sat up front In Baku they had come to me and said that
they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case As it turns out
they knew what was happening in Sumgait

I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is
closed there is no way to get there That the city is closed off and the
buses aren't running Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two
minutes And suddenlyno buses Well we tried to get there via private
drivers One man an Azerbaijani said Let's go find some other way to get
there They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to
take us to Sumgait

He took us there But the others had said I wouldn't go if you gave me a
thousand rubles Why Because they're burning the city and killing the
Armenians There isn't an Armenian left Well I got hold of myself so I could
still stand up So we squared it away the four of us got in the car and we
set off for Sumgait On the way the driver says In fact there aren't any
Armenians left 'They burned them all beat them all and stabbed them Well
I was silent The whole wayodd milesI was silent The driver asks me
How old are you old man He wants to know if I'm being that quiet not
saying anything maybe it means I'm an Armenian How old are you he asks
me I say I'm  I'm  too but I call you 'old man' I say It
depends on God each person's life in this world is different I look much
older than my years that's why he called me old man Well after that he was
silent too

We're approaching the city I look and see tanks all around and a cordon
Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand Well he
was waving his hand we all start waving our hands I'm sitting there with
them I start waving my hand too I realized that this was a sign that meant
there were no Armenians with us

I look at the citythere is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the
street you know and there's no traffic Well probably I was scared They
stopped our car People were standing on the sidewalks They have armature
shafts and stones    And they stopped us   

Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's
not The Armenians usually    For example I'm an Armenian but I speak
their language very well Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for
nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh is actually correct The
pronunciations are different Anyone who says pundukh even if they're not
Armenian they immediately take out and start to slash Another one says
There was a car there with five people inside it he says They started
hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire And they didn't let the
people out he says they wouldn't let them get out of the car I only saw
the car but the driver says that he saw everything Well he often drives from
Baku to Sumgait and back   

When they stop us we all get out of the car I look and there's a short guy
his eyes are gleaming he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in
the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one We're
Azerbaijani' they tell him 'no Armenians here He did come up to me when
we were pulling our things out and says Maybe you're an Armenian old man
But in Azerbaijani I say You should be ashamed of yourself And    he
left Turned and left That was all that happened What was I to do I had
to    the city was on fire but I had to steal my children out of my own
home

They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street that's where the Kavkaz store
and three large story buildings are That's the beginning of downtown I
saw that burned automobile there completely burned only metal remained I
couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets Later I was told it
was a Zhiguli And the people in there were completely incinerated Nothing
remained of them not even any traces That driver had told me about it and I
saw the car myself The car was there The skeleton a metallic carcass About
 to  yards from the Kavkaz store

I see a military transport an armored personnel carrier The hatches are
closed And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it the
crowd is And I hear shots not automatic fire it's true but pistol shots
Several shots There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier
Someone in the crowd was shooting Apparently they either wanted to kill the
soldiers or get a machine gun or something At that point there was only one
armored personnel carrier And all the tanks were outside the city cordoning
off Sumgait

I walked on I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant I can tell by
their gait that they're not bandits they're just people walking home I
joined them so in case something happened in case someone came up to us
and asked questions either of us would be in a position to answer you see
But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly
recognized I tried to keep at a distance and walked where there were fewer
people Well so I walked into Microdistrict  which is across from our block
I can't get into our block but I walked where there were fewer people so as
to get around Well there I see a tall guy and  to  people are walking
behind him And he's shouting into a megaphone Comrades the Armenian
Azerbaijani war has begun

The police have megaphones like that So they're talking and walking around
the second microdistrict I see that they're coming my way and turn off
behind a building I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings
and inside the microdistricts there were about  or  people standing on every
corner and at the middles of the buildings and at the edges What they were
doing I can't say because I couldn't get up close to them I was afraid But
the most important thing was to get away from there to get home and at least
find out if my children were alive or not

 Henrik and Hilmi writes



henrik  The Armenians in NagarnoKarabagh are simply DEFENDING their
henrik  RIGHTS to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are
henrik  INVADING their homeland



HE     Homeland First NagarnoKarabagh was Armenians homeland today
HE     Fizuli Lacin and several villages in Azerbadjan
HE     are their homeland Can't you see the
HE     the  Great Armenia dream in this With facist methods like
HE     killing raping and bombing villages The last move was the
HE     blast of a truck with  kurdish refugees trying to
HE     escape the from Lacin a city that was given to the Kurds
HE     by the Armenians



NagornoKarabakh is in Azerbaijan not Armenia Armenians have lived in Nagorno
Karabakh ever since there were Armenians Armenians used to live in the areas
between Armenia and NagornoKarabakh and this area is being used to invade
Nagorno Karabakh Armenians are defending themselves If Azeris are dying
because of a policy of attacking Armenians then something is wrong with this
policy		


 	Attacking Who is attacking who Even the country you live inUSA have condemned
	Armenia for it's attacking And you start to say that the attackers
	are the Azeris

	Armenians have lived in Nagorno Karabakh ever since there were Armenians

	
	Azeris have lived in Nagorno Karabakh ever since there were Azeris
	Don't come with nonsence there is no reason to attack a people
	just because a man called Gorbatjov and co gave the freedom to the people
	in this area


If I recall correctly it was Stalin who caused all this problem with land
in the first place not the Armenians



	It's easy for people like you to blame history The were a lot of
        Indians living in USA There is no reason for these
	Indians to attack the American
	people and sayIt was the fault of the government of Germany and Great
	Britain because they made people come to our place Armenians lived in
	harmony with the Azeris until Gorbatjov and co gave freedom to the people
	in Karabag then the Armenians started to kill rape and torture the Azeris not only
	in Karabag but also noe in Azerbadjan

henrik  However I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane
henrik  to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
henrik  that happened last SUMMER Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
henrik  carrying humanitarian aid bound to ARMENIA



HE     Don't speak about things you don't know  US Cargo planes
HE     were heading to Armenia When the Turkish authorities
HE     announced that they were going to search these cargo
HE     planes  of these planes returned to it's base in Germany
HE      of these planes were searched in Turkey The content of
HE     of the other  planes Not hard to guess is it It was sure not
HE     humanitarian aid


What story are you talking about Planes from the US have been sending
aid into Armenian for two years I would not like to guess about what were in
the  planes in your story I would like to find out



HE     Search Turkish planes You don't know what you are talking about
HE     Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
HE     to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
HE     it self not the Karabag province So why search a plane for weapons
HE     since it's content is announced to be weapons

	It's too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia

	  That's what i don't want you couldn't imagine the result of a war
	  So France Greece and  USA wants to start fighting with Azerbadjan
	  They give a lot more weapons to the Armenians without
	  saying it that's no secret any more


	  I must say that these Armenian Government is very shortsighted
	  Do they think that they shall move from it's neigbours when the war
 	  is over The neighbour around will be there and Armenia must
	  live in harmony with these if they don't want a stoneage country
	  for that's what's will happen Armenia if the wars continues

	  Look The President of Turkey Turgut Ozal died and  Petrosyan
	  the Armenian Presindent is now in Turkey for the funeral Is it because
	  he liked him Sure NOT because Armenia needs it's neighbours and must
	  live with these But Armenia can't stop this war with continued ordertaking
	  from states like France and USA With other words if you love your people
	  you must think twice

	  And i wonder Shoot down turkish planes WITH WHAT ohhh i forgot
	  the Armenians can't find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned
	  countries

It seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested
who is behind the Center for Polict Research I will oblige

My name is Elias Davidsson Icelandic citizen born in Palestine My
mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'
at that times this group was defined as 'Jews' She was forced to go
to Palestine due to many  cynical factors I have meanwhile settled in
Iceland  years ago and met many people who were thrown out from
my homeland Palestine because of the same reason they belonged to
the 'indesirables' These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem
with the children of whom I played as child Their crime Theyare
not Jews My conscience does not accept such injustice period My
work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism
and racial discrimination Those who protest against such practices
in Arab countries have my support  as long as their protest is based
on a principled position but not as a tactic to deflect criticism
from Israel The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal

The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities
undertaken under my guidance in different domains and which command
the support of many volunteers in Iceland It is however not a formal
institution and works with minimal funds

Professionally I am music teacher and composer I have published
several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe

I would hope that discussion about IsraelPalestine be conducted in
a more civilized manner Calling names is not helpful

In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion
Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to
do so

However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass
in a personal manner legally responsible for their deeds I cannot
accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I
urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect
threats

PS My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics It has to do with
the search for peace which would enable justice I don't consider that
justice is done when nonJews who fled or were expelled in 
are not permitted to return to their homeland This can at best be called
pragmatism a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong It can
never be called justice And peace without justice will never be peace
It is my conviction that the situation in which a state through the
law attempts to discourage mixed marriages as Israel does is not
normal Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than
Western democracies such as the United States in which Jews are free to
marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands My proposal may have
drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything just to
compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy
endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriageWhen the day
will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society
in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic
affiliation of its constituency such a Fund would not be needed any
more I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their
traditions why not  But this is not the affairs of a state Western
democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that
most
American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed
Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW

I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views
and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional infantile
outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect
Judaism are uncivilized Such behaviour is not good for Judaism

   THE US HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM A COSTLY AND DANGEROUS MISTAKE

                         by Theodore J O'Keefe


HARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT within clear view of the Jefferson
Memorial an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial
has arisen on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States of
America a costly and dangerous mistake  On ground where no monument yet
marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all
races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation sits today a
massive and costly edifice devoted above all to a contentious and false
version of the ordeal in Europe during World War II of nonAmerican
members of a minority sectarian group  Now in the deceptive guise of
tolerance the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda
campaign financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer
in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America

     How did the federal government allow the creation of such a
monstrosity  What is its meaning for American policy and for American
values  And what must the American people do to regain control of the land
their servants in Washington handed over to a foreign interest and to
establish an enterprise thereon whether a museum or otherwise informed by
and conducted according to American principles and interests

Photograph captioned The fivestory  million US Holocaust Memorial
Museum in Washington DC was built and is operated by a taxpayerfunded
federal agency  In the foreground is the museum's sixsided Hall of
Remembrance


ORIGINS

     In the late s during the presidency of James Earl Jimmy Carter
a propaganda campaign to promote the Holocaust the alleged systematic
slaughter of some  million Jews by the Germans during World War II was
organized and carried out from Hollywood and New York As Benjamin Meed an
important functionary of the council which controls the Holocaust museum
wrote in 


          Almost a dozen years ago a new phenomena sic developed  The
     Holocaust was introduced into schools colleges and universities
     Television broadcast programs on the Holocaust and millions of
     Americans watched them  Soon Americans took great interest in the
     lessons of the Holocaust its uniqueness and its universal message


     Why the urgency of this campaign Two factors were paramount  first
the beginnings more than three decades after the end of World War II of
an objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged German policy
to exterminate European Jewry

     Second the need to justify Zionist theory and practice in the face of
unprecedented international resistance to Israeli intransigence including
the famous UN General Assembly Resolution which equated Zionism with
racism and to defend Israel's aggressive policy under the leadership of
the former terrorist Prime Minister Menachem Begin


THE US HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COUNCIL

     In  President Carter his administration beleaguered at home and
abroad succumbed to pressure from the new Holocaust lobby and thus
America's influential Israelfirst minority by creating through executive
order the President's Commission on the Holocaust  Two years later on
October   Congress passedunanimouslya law establishing the
United States Holocaust Memorial Council charged principally with
constructing and overseeing the operation of a permanent living memorial
to the victims of the holocaust and with providing for appropriate ways
for the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance as an annual
national civic commemoration of the Holocaust

     A priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council and
after years of costly delay during which the US Holocaust Memorial
Council's budget swelled from  million to over  million a year the
US Holocaust Memorial Museum has been completed and readied for opening
on April  


A SECTARIAN ALIEN AGENDA

     The Holocaust Memorial Council besides soliciting tens of millions of
dollars in taxdeductible donations to finance the Holocaust museum has
busied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority
Zionist ends

     The membership of the council a US federal agency has been
overwhelmingly Jewish since its founding in   The council's two
different chairmenElie Wiesel and Harvey Meyerhoffhave both been
committed to the support of the state of Israel and the chairs of the
council's most important committees have been likewise Jewish and Zionist

     The chief fundraiser for the Holocaust museum Miles Lerman was
formerly American vice chairman for the State of Israel Bonds Organization
promoting taxfree investment in a country which receives by far the
largest amount of US foreign aid per year  Working the same wealthy
Jewish Americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for Israel
Lerman has helped raise nearly  million in taxdeductible
contributions  The biggest donors have been rewarded by having various
components of the museum named for them eg the Wexler Learning Center

     Nor is erecting and operating the Holocaust Memorial Museum the only
function with which the Holocaust Memorial Council has been charged
Another of its duties is to commemorate the Days of Remembrance for Victims
of the Holocaust which Congress has raised to an annual national civic
commemoration of the Holocaust  Like the Israeli Yom Hashoah Day of the
Holocaust on which they are based the Days of Remembrance are dated
according to the lunar Hebrew calendar and thus like Passover or Chanukah
fluctuate from year to year These foreign days of lamentation are
currently celebrated under the flag of the republic to prayers and chants
in Hebrew in governmental settings from the Capital Rotunda to city halls
across the land  Need it be stated that no group of American victims of
persecution let alone another foreign group enjoys any such federally
mandated and taxsupported day or days of recognition


THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM'S ONESIDED HISTORY

     Although the US Holocaust Memorial Council during its early years
made noises about recognizing the ordeals of nonJews during World War II
by every indication from advance literature published by the council the
US Holocaust Memorial Museum is relentlessly Judeocentric  While
according to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit here and
there are nods to nonJewish groups oppressed by the German National
Socialists never to groups victimized by Germany's enemies above all by
Stalin's USSR the larger holocaust of World War II which claimed an
estimated  to  million lives around the world is ignored in preference
to the Jewish ordeal Thus to cite just one telling example the museum's
Life before the Holocaust exhibit refers strictly to Jewish life before
the Holocaust

     Where in fact nonJews figure in the Museum they figure largely as
villains the Germans and their allies and collaborators the Western
Allies including America who refused to accept a large immigration before
the war the American political and military leaders who refused to
authorize costly bombing raids on the Auschwitz gas chambers


RED LIBERATORS

     The museum's message that support for Jews is the sole measure of
decency during World War II leads to anomalies which in an American museum
raised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which this
republic is based can only be called shocking  That the victims of World
War II atrocities by the Alliesmassacres such as the firebombing of
Tokyo and Dresden the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Soviet
slaughter of their Polish prisoners at Katyn the mass rapes carried out by
the Red Army at the war's endreceive no mention is deplorable  But the
museum's treatment of the armed forces which defended Stalin's savage
Soviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque

     In the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Communists appear only in the
guise of resistance fighters and liberators  For example the
submachine gun and false papers of Samuel Weissberg a Communist Party
member who rose to high rank in a Communist guerrilla group in North
France are on honored display no less precious a relic than the standard
heaps of shoes and hair in the museum's permanent exhibit

     Even more unsettling is the honor given to Stalin's notorious Red
Army which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities across
Europe during and after the war  As the US Holocaust Memorial
Council's newsletter fulsomely puts it Flags will hang in the museum to
honor the millions of Soviet soldiers who drove Nazi forces westward and
who were the first Allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence of
the camps  In the words of Council chairman Harvey Meyerhoff these
martial banners of the Red tyranny have a single association Much more
than simply wartime memorabilia these military artifacts are a significant
contribution to memory one that will remind future generations of the
pivotal role Soviet forces played in defeating Nazism

     What must the millions of Americans originating or descending from the
European nationsRussia Ukraine Belarus Estonia Latvia Lithuania
Poland Hungary Czechoslovakia Romania Bulgaria former Yugoslavia
for which the Red military artifacts symbolized invasion tyranny
oppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armies
of their persecutors hailed as liberators


ISRAEL IN THE MUSEUM

     Just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum's
director Yeshayahu Weinberg and the head of its Learning Center
Yechiam Halevy were brought in from Israel the museum's treatment of the
state of Israel is adulatory  An emotive tribute to the founding of Israel
is an integral part of the exhibition  That the establishment of Israel
and its expansion in subsequent wars has meant colonial occupation and
oppression for millions of the land's native Palestinians and
dispossession and exile for millions more goes unmentionedanother
grotesquery in an American museum supposed to instruct in the dangers of
intolerance and disregard of human rights  As for the momentous
collaboration between Hitler's German state and the Jewish Agency in the
s which through the Ha'avara Agreement enabled the transfer of vital
capital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled Jewish
immigrants to Palestine that is passed over in utter silence


HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS

     The Holocaust Museum's skewed history is not simply a matter of one
sidedness and omission  The museum has further committed itself to a fixed
and final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspect
evidence for a German policy of annihilating European Jewry largely in gas
chambers in numbers approaching  million  This despite a considerable
body of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decades
in many lands and which contests by academic means the substance of the
Holocaust extermination thesis

     That the US Holocaust Memorial Council is aware of the work of the
revisionists is clear The council's literature is replete not with
substantive refutations of revisionist scholarship but with slander and
polemic  To cite one characteristic example the US Holocaust Memorial
Museum Newsletter of May  featured a frontpage attack on Holocaust
revisionism by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Occidental College in which
the author decried the revisionists for producing material that looked
scholarly then lauded the US Holocaust Memorial Museum as among the
most efficacious ways of combating this pernicious trend while
neglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship

     The US Holocaust Memorial Council recognizes that there is a
historical debate on the holocaust but takes official notice of the
dissenting position only to attack it  That an American institution
supported by the taxes of all Americans should commit itself to inflexible
historical orthodoxyin the service of a single American minorityis an
intolerable imposition on our First Amendment rights as well as a mockery
of the Western and American ideal of objective scholarship


A CENTER FOR EDUCATION

     US Holocaust Memorial Council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff has stated
The museum is primarily an educational institution  From the
council's own literature however it is clear what Meyerhoff means by
education  The roleplaying for children as well as adults who visit the
museum visitors are to be issued identity cards bearing the name and
alleged fate of various Holocaust victims the hightech computer and
video effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment the
museum's tendentiously described artifacts and the museum's goal as
proclaimed by its Zionist fundraising chairman Miles Lerman of ensuring
that Children in Dubuque families in Tucson and schoolteachers in
Atlanta will learn the history and the lessons of Auschwitz as thoroughly
as they learn the history of their own communitiesall these show that
the US Holocaust Memorial Museum is a propaganda enterprise that seeks
to indoctrinate all Americans in a uniquely and partisanly Jewish and
Zionist version of not merely the past but the present and the
future


THE AMERICAN RESPONSE

     What is the American response to a partisan museum constructed in a
place solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic to
be lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when even in our
country's capital thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our national
monuments  What is the American response to an ambitious propaganda agenda
that aims to impose a sectarian Holocaust remembrance in schools where
our children cannot pray in town halls and federal buildings from which
the religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom of
worship

     Over two centuries ago Thomas Jefferson wrote To compel a man to
furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he
disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical

     Nearly  years ago Abraham Lincoln said I insist that if there is
anything which it is the duty of the whole people to never entrust to
any hands but their own that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of
their own liberties and institutions

     The US Holocaust Memorial Museum and the council which runs it as
agencies of the government in which the American people is sovereign must
be removed from the special interest that now controls it

     The scope and purpose of the Museum must be expanded from its present
onesided emphasis on foreign Jewish sufferings real and imagined in
Europe during the s and s to a compassionate yet realistic concern
for all victims but above all for American victims of historic
injustice

     The Museum must be made a place where Americans of every heritage and
scholars of every viewpoint may gather educate and be educated without
accusation and in the absence of propaganda  Until it is the men and
women who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for America
of every race nationality and creed will rest uneasy

                  THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS

 Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip



 Five days ago girls at the AlKhansaa secondary said a group of naked



 The same day soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth



     The army said it was checking the reports

Barfling brings us some curious stories that haven't been reported
outside of fertile imaginations  This fits in well with a report in
the New York Times from April  



Scores of Girls in Egypt Faint in Classrooms
By Chris Hedges
Cairo April 

The khamseen the blustery sandstorms that arrive every spring have
brought with them not only the usual clouds of grit and dust but also
what the authorities describe as collective hysteria

Hundreds of teenage girls have been fainting en masse in classrooms
breaking out in sobs and complaining of unpleasant smells and nausea



There is no clinical reason for it said Dr Ahmed Rashed at Agouza
Hospital where dozens of girls have been tested  It's just
hysteria  We have carried out blood tests urine tests every kind of
test we can think of and nothing has shown up

More than a thosand young girls between  and  have suffered
attacks in some  schools across the country since the first cases
were reported over two weeks ago



Lawmakers and commentators have attributed the fainting to everything
from food posoning to a plot by unamed enemy agents to make Egyptian
women infertile

Similar attacks have been reported from time to time through Europe
One was reported about a decade ago in the IsraeliOccupied Gaza
Strip

Islamic fundamentalist leaders have blamed the Israeli secret service
for the spells  This is all the work of the Mossad said a militant
cleric in Imbaba a Cairo slum  They are seeding capsules around the
country that release something into the air that can't be detected
It has a special effect on the hormones of young girls  It is part of
a plot to destroy Egypt

  Where have seen this argument before  Because there is no
  evidence for the conspiracy therefore it must be true



Health Minister Ragheb Dewidar said that neither medical or
environmental tests had found any contaminant and that the cause was
psychological  If one girl who is popular or a leader feels faint
for some reason he said the others start believing that they are
suffering from the sypmtoms

But no one is taking the matter lightly  Prime Minister Atef Sedki
has held regular mettings with Mr Dewidar to discuss the attacks
Government officials say they are determined to bring the phenomenon
to an end

Parents and teachers should fight against these rumors and accept the
results of our scientific analysis Education Minister Hussein Kamal
Bahadeen said



You can't make this stuff up  Unless you're Barfling perhaps

    April th is approaching and Armenians around the world
are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members
by the Turkish government between  and 
    At least  Million Armenians perished during that period
and it is important to note that those who deny that this event
ever took place either supported the policy of  to exterminate
the Armenians or as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan
would like to see it happen again
    Thank you for taking the time to read this post

MASSACRE UNCOVERED

By ANATOL LIEVEN

More than sixty bodies including those of women and children have
been spotted on hillsides in NagornoKarabakh confirming claims
that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees Hundreds are missing

Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley
and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's
massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees

From that hill can be seen both the Armeniancontrolled town of
Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters
of Agdam Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their
own lines

We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last
troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out
They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov
who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan flew to Stepanakert
to ease their departure

A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their
dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest All the
same two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian
positions

In all  bodies could be counted at the scene At least another
 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days These figures
do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed
the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night The figures also
do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies

Zahid Jabarov a survivor of the massacre said he saw up to 
people shot down at the point we visited and refugees who came
by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and
of leaving a trail of bodies along their path Around the bodies
we saw were scattered possessions clothing and personnel documents
The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which
killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre
All are the bodies of ordinary people dressed in the poor ugly
clothing of workers

Of the  we saw only one policeman and two apparent national
volunteers were wearing uniform All the rest were civilians
including eight women and three small children TWO GROUPS
APPARENTLY FAMILIES HAD FALLEN TOGETHER THE CHILDREN CRADLED
IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS

SEVERAL OF THEM INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL HAD TERRIBLE HEAD
INJURIES ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY
SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND

Seems to me that a lot of good muslims would care about those terms
Especially those affected by the ideology and actions that such terms
decscribe The Bosnians suffering from such bigotry comes to mind They
get it from people who call them 'dirty descendants of Turks' from
people who hate their religion and from those who don't think they are
really muslims at all since they are white The suffering that they are

Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag'
and xSoviet Armenia by the Armenians Between  and  Armenians
committed unheardof crimes resorted to all conceivable methods of
despotism organized massacres poured petrol over babies and burned
them raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound
hand and foot took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated
personal property and real estate And today they put Azeris in the most
unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history


AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafebar on  the
Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in
his trousers torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of
Hojali just over three months ago writes Hugh Pope

I'm still  wearing the same  clothes I don't have  any others
the  yearold carpenter  said  beginning his  account of  the
Hojali disaster I was wounded in five places but I am lucky to
be alive

Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food without electricity
for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for 
days They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the
 to   people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the
edge of Karabakh

At about pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard
before  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons  artillery  heavy
machineguns the lot Mr Sadikov said

Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction
of  the  attack Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started
fleeing the town  down a hill through a stream  and through the
snow into a forest on the other side

To escape the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam
about   miles away They  thought they  were going to  make it
until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two
Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak

None of my group was hurt up to then  Then we were spotted by
a  car on  the road  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening
fire Mr Sadikov said

Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward
to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians but  their efforts
were mostly  in vain  Mr Sadikov  said only   people  from his
group of   made it  through including his wife  and militiaman
son  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died  including  his
yearold elder brother

I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat
he said pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes We
have never got any of the bodies back

The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire
One hero  of the  evacuation Alif  Hajief was  shot dead  as he
struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's
crossing Mr Sadikov said

Another hero  Elman Memmedov the  mayor of Hojali said  he and
several others  spent the whole day  of  February in  the bushy
hillside surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three
Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay

As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam  there was
little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was
soon to flee

The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian
rocket attack Some people just  kept going Mr Sadikov said I
had to  get to the  hospital for treatment I  was in a  bad way
They even found a bullet in my sock

Victims of  war An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son killed  in the
Hojali massacre in February  left Nurses struggle in primitive
conditions  centre  to  save  a  wounded  man  in  a  makeshift
operating  theatre set  up  in a  train carriage  Griefstricken
relatives in  the town of Agdam  right weep over the  coffin of
another of the massacre victims Calculating the final death toll
has been  complicated because Muslims  bury their dead  within 
hours

C'mon you still haven't corrected yourself 'wieneramus' In April
 Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus A
number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German
officials in spring and summer  One of them was Souren Begzadian
Paikhar son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku
Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler asking for German support to his
Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the
creation of an Armenian SS formation in order

to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the
 spirit of the Nazi ideas

He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories
of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish
homeland Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored
by General Dro the Butcher He played an important role in the
establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any
official position His views were represented by his men in the
respective organs An interesting meeting took place between Dro
and ReichsfuehrerSS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 
Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after
a long conversation asked if he could visit POW camp close to
Berlin Himmler provided Dro with his private car

A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not
'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy
As such they were subject to German racism However Armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged In August
 Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of
Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs

We Armenians did not spare the Tartars If persisted in the slaughtering
 of prisoners the looting and the rape and massacre of the helpless become
 commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course

 I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground
 in numbers like the fallen leaves in a forest They had been as helpless
 and as defenseless as sheep They had not died as soldiers die in the
 heat of battle fired with ardor and courage with weapons in their hands
 and exchanging blow for blow They had died as the helpless must with
 their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself

       Nicosia Ankara  Tel Aviv The Israeli  secret service
       Mossad  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant
       information in connection  with the camps set  up in the
       Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of
       militants of the PKK and ASALA Armenian Secret Army for

       militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos
       mountains in  southern Cyprus  The same  sources stated
       that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military
       training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps
       They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for
       Libya Lebanon Syria Greece  and Iran after completing
       their training  Mossad has established that  due to the
       clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist
       groups based  in Syria the PKK  and ASALA organisations
       moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus  where they
       would  be  more  comfortable They  also  transferred  a
       number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos
       mountains

       Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement
       which is known as the MNA has opened liaison offices in
       Nicosia Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs
       of the  camps The offices are used to provide  material

                    Special to The New York Times

ATHENS June   A dispute developed today between Athens and
Washington over United States intelligence reports saying that
Athens for several months conducted negotiations with the
terrorist known as Abu Nidal

They said the contacts were verified in what were termed hard
intelligence reports

Abu Nidal leads the Palestinian splinter group Al Fatah
Revolutionary Council implicated in the  airport
bombings at Rome and Vienna that contributed to the Reagan
Administration's decision to bomb Tripoli Libya last year

In Washington State Department officials said that when
Administration officials learned about the contacts the
State Department drafted a strongly worded demarche The
officials also expressed unhappiness with Greece's dealings
with ASALA the Armenian Liberation Army which has carried
out terrorist acts against Turks

   Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest
points I would still like to know why do do not ask any question
of this sort about the Arab countries

   If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours your
fixation on Israel must stop  You might have to start asking the
same sort of questions of Arab countries as well  You realize it
would not work as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the
last several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would
begin to look like the biased attack that it is

   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for
Policy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot
who hates Israel

   Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel  I
have heard that your family once lived in Israel but the members
of your family could not cut the competition there  Is this true
about your family  Is this true about you  Is this actually not
about Israel but is really a personal vendetta  Why are you not
the least bit objective about Israel  Do you think that the name
of your phonybaloney center hides your bias in the least  Get a
clue Mr Davidsson  Haven't you realized yet that when you post
such stupidity in this group you are going to incur answers from
people who are armed with the truth  Haven't you realized that a
piece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a
truth  Haven't you realized that you are in over your head  The
people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or
need them to be  This is not the place for such pseudoanalysis
You will be continually ripped to shreds until you start to show
some regard for objectivity  Or you can continue to show what an
antiIsrael zealot you are trying to disguise your bias behind a
pompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research'  You ought to
know that you are a laughing stock your 'Center' is considered a
joke and until you either go away or make at least some attempt
to be objective you will have a place of honor among the clowns
bigots and idiots of Usenet

I couldn't have said it better Mark

 I said the fixation on Bosnia is due to it being in a European country
  rather than the third world

 Ken says intervention in Somalia is a counterexample

I am a staunch Republican BTW  The irony of arguing against military
intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me  I was opposed
to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons although clearly it was
not nearly as risky

Based on the same reasons  You mean you were opposed to US intervention in
Somalia because since Somalia is a European country instead of the third world
the desire to help Somalia is racist  I don't think this same reason applies
to Somalia at all

No you have completely misunderstood  I was opposed to intervention in
Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia  there is
no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the
lives of American servicemen and there are too many crises in the world for us
to take on all of them  In the case of Bosnia the risks are obviously much
greater and there are other countries in a much better position and with far
better reasons to take action than the US

The whole point is that Somalia is a third world country and we were more
willing to send troops there than to Bosniaexactly the opposite of what
the fixation on European countries theory would predict  Similarly the
desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite
of what that theory predicts

You continue to misunderstand  I did not say the reason why people want to
intervene is because of racist  you seem to be overly fond of using this
word btw  I said the phenomenon was racerelated which is not the same as
racist  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp motives  I
said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result
of it being  closer to home  happening to people we can identify with and
 relentlessly harped on by the media  I never said anything about which side
would be preferred which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the
conflict than any psychological factors  I think there is no doubt that despite
the fact we intervened in Somalia the level of attention devoted to there was
considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia if the newspapers and tv news
I see are any guide

Dear Mr Davidsson

   You claim that your purpose is to fight racism  But you don't
seem to have any interest in injustice except that which may have
been committed by Israel  The treatment of Jews in Arab nations
an injustice of staggerring proportions is an injustice that you
do not seem to care the least bit about  Why not

In Aprjulianuwoca mrizvigfxenggauwoca Mr Mubashir Rizvi writes

It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my postingI recieved a couple of letters toosome has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern worldThose who contest this statement present the figures of the World War IIHowever we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop ittoday is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILLIt
seems to be that what we lack is the will

The idea of the US or any other nation taking action ie military
intervention in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who
advocate such action After the belligerants are subdued it would require
an occupation force for one or two generations If you will stop and
think about it you will realize that these people have never forgotten
a single slight or injury they have imbibed hatred with their mother's
milk If we stop the fighting seize and destroy all weapons they will
simply go back to killing each other with clubs And the price for this
futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to
die A price I am unwilling to even consider

Second point of difference which makes it different from the holocastsp  is that at that time international community
didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event

There is no valid comparison to the Holocaust All of the Jewish people
that I have known as friends were not brought up to hate To be wary of
others most certainly but not to hate And except for the Warsaw
uprising they were unarmed and even in Warsaw badly outgunned
It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's muscles
Suppose we do this thing what will you tell the parents wives children
lovers of those we are sending to die That they gave their lives in some noble cause Noble cause separating some mad dogs who will turn on them

Well I will offer you some muscle Suppose we tell them that they have
one week this will give foreign nationals time to leave to cease
their bloodshed At the end of that week bring in the Tomahawk firing
ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities Perhaps
when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden
attack of brains Send in missiles by all means but do not send in
troops

today inspite of all the mightthe international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which

By all means lift the embargo

is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bullyHence indirecltly and possibly
unintentionally mankind has sided with the killersAnd thisI think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world

Which killers Do you honestly believe they are all on one side

  Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover Israel
  should totally back down Sothe easiest way to get away with attacking
  another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
  innocent lives

 Tell me Tim what are these guerillas doing wrong Assuming that they are using
 civilians for cover are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country If the
 buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel is it not working Why is it
 further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages Why not just
 kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone You see there is more to
 the shelling of the villages it is called RETALIATION GETTING BACK
 GETTING EVEN It doesn't make sense to shell the villages The least
 it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of
 civilians

If you recall a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon
this  When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of
popular sentiment the topic aroseWhen does a civilian stop
becoming a civilian  If he houses and shelters guerillas of
his own free will aiding them has he violated his civilian status

  What So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states
  can start all over again While I also hope for this to happen it will
  only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are prepared to take on the
  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their
  soil They have to Prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way
  Israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of
  tolerance towards antiIsrael guerillas inresidence

 If Israel is not willing to accept the word of others then IMHO it has
 no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks

But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways
If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word
of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the
Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy  Afterall
Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas
it occupied in Lebanon during SLG

 Tim you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been
 disarmed Hezbollah remains the only independent militia Hezbollah does
 not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up
 Sheikh Mosavi his wife and young son Of course if Israel would withdraw
 from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't
 make the Lebanese so mad as to do that Furthermore with Hezbollah
 subsequently disarmed it would not be possible

That is not exactly true  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups
have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel

  It has not Without the support and active involvement of Syria
  Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred
  Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain
  control If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel

 Tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border
 Not lately eh

 Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use
 territory under their control to attack Israel While Lebanon would be better
 off with Syria and Israel out of its borders the presence of Syrian troops
 in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory not on
 Israeli troops in Lebanon however Please note the distinction in the
 past two years

True but the Syrians did allow until at least  guerillas to operate
in the areas that were under their control provided that those guerillas
were attacking Israeli lines

The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term
peace as others in the area might be

 BTW does the Litani River not flow West and not South I think that its waters

 River makes no sense in any case The Hasbani River on the other hand flows
 into the Jordan if I am not mistaken

The Litani river flows in a westsouthwestern direction and indeed does
not run through the buffer zone  The Hasbani does flow into the Jordan
but contrary to what our imaginative poster might write there has been
no increase in the inflow from this river that is not proportional to
climatic changes in rainfall

Actually if can remember correctly was it not reported and even on camera
some time during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon or when the itifada began
that CNN caught regular uniformed Israeli soldiers breaking the arms of
some Arab youngsters in a very professional and brutal manner someone
please give full details if they can remember

So was it on CNN or not

This is one of the few
occassions on which such a scene has been transmitted to the West and
in the USA  it caused uproar and was one of the factors that has significantly
changed the preception of the Israeli army's role in the mideast

So there is proof for you


What proof You said above was it not reported and someone please give
full details if they can remember Hear say is not proof


It is obvious that is a systematic policy of the
Israelis which must be occurring on a massive scale behind the scenes

Yes like the  or more Palestinians brutally murdered by their brothers

 	Tell me do these young men also attack Syrian troops

In the South Lebanon area only Israeli and SLA and Lebanese troops
are present
Syrian troops are deployed north of the Awali river  Between the
Awali river and the Security Zone only Lebanese troops are stationed


 with the blood of its soldiers  If Israel is interested in peace
 than it should withdraw from OUR land

 	There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens  It
 seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain
 themselves from violence and unable to to realize that their actions
 prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon

That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government
I agree peace guarantees would be better for all but I am addressing
the problem as it stands now  Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement
will be concluded soon and will include security guarantees for
both sides  My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties
in the interim period  In my opinion if Israel withdraws
unilaterally it would still be better off than staying
The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing
to do such a move  I hope to be be able to change your opinion
and theirs that's why I post to tpm

 	If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace then
 Israel would not have to be there  Until it is Israel prefers that
 its soldiers die rather than its children

As I explained I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally
I believe no attacks would ensue against northern Israel  I also
explained why I believe that to be the case  My suggestion
is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides
It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion



 If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw
 unilaterally from the socalled Security Zone before the conclusion
 of the peace talks  Such a move would save Israeli lives
 advance peace efforts give Israel a great moral lift better Israel's
 public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations
 since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in
 peace and has already offered some important concessions

 	Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is
 signed  Not a day before  Withdraw because of casualties would tell
 the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is
 kill a few soldiers  Its not gonna happen


That is too bad

 Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah
 be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not
 accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a
 shelling occurs than it will consider retaking the buffer zone
 and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it


 	Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer
 zone  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while
 holding your neighbors land

Because Israel is not occupying the Security Zone free of charge
It is paying the price for that  Once Israel withdraws it may have
lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save
some soldiers' lives that is my contention

  If Lebanon were willing to agree to
 those conditions Israel would quite probably have left already
 Unfortunately it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the
 Hizbolah and maintain the peace

That is completely untrue  Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese
politics  The real heavy weights are Syria's allies  The gov't is
supported by Syria  The Lebanese Army is over  troops and
unified like never before  Hizbollah can have no moral justification
in attacking Israel proper especially after Israeli withdrawal
That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the
Israeli gov'ts  If Israel does withdraw and such an act
Hizbolllah attacking Israel would be akin to political and moral
suicide

I recently read that during Bill Clinton's campaign he stated
that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital  According to the article Mr Clinton
reaffirmed this after winning the presidency  However
during recent talks with President Mubarak Secretary of
State Christopher stated that the status of Jerusalem
will be a final matter of discussion between the parties

Now I don't want to start a big discussion over the status
of Jerusalem  All I want to know is if anyone can
authenticate Mr Clinton's statements with dates places etc

From a recent interview in Middle East Insight magazine
Clinton said that he supports moving the US Embassy to
Jerusalem but would not do so at this time because it
would interrupt the peace talks

  BTW I would start by sending your flyers to each of the UN officials

   I guess Hasan finally revealed the source of his claim that Israel
   diverted water from Lebanonhis imagination
   
   Alan H Stein                     asteinisraelnysernetorg
  Mr waterhead
  i never said that israel diverted lebanese rivers in fact i said that
  israel went into southern lebanon to  make sure that no
  water is being used on the lebanese
  side so that all water would run into Jordan river where there
  israel will use it  head

 Of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more
 difficult  You have not bothered to substantiate this in
 any way  Basil do you know of any evidence that would support
 this

I agree with Shai  there are many references to Israeli
plans on the Litani river but I have yet to find hard
evidence  I had mentioned before that there is a report
commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river it is
still in draft form  The Israeli gov't also commissioned
a study on the river that was done by Dr Ben Wolfe
The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon
flows Southward then West across South Lebanon and
discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre
There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani
that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river
The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water
from the Litani into these then the water would flow
naturally into the Lac De Houle  BUT there is no evidence
of any diversion structure which would need to be at least
 km long  The area is mountainous inaccessible and
occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent
reports of the existence of any diversion structure there
Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells
It is also rumored that Israe has  m wells
tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the
Israeli side of the border  If such wells are indeed
under use they would be costly to operate
high energy costs and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should
agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers
as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral
negociations on regional issues  The fact that we have
been at war all this time has led to the current state
of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is
completely unregulated

    snip
    imagine   It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like
    to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
    in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc

 I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are terrorist
 camps  There are however some which come very close to serving that
 purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way
 prior to the invasion

The village I described was actually the closest I could come to
describing mine  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian
population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and
thus gets bombed more often  In such villages often the only remaining
inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go
But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like
mine  One where civilians and guerillas live together  They are
often inhabiting the same house  Many families are large some
have members of the families involved in Hizollah most others
are not  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon Israel is
not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines but a guerilla
tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with
the local populace  Not because they are evil cowards that
use women and children as shields but because that is the only
way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army

 Some of the villages and yours might well be among them are as you
 describe  Not all are  There are a large number of groups in the area
 backed by various organizations with a wide range of purposes  Hizbollah
 and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be

Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias  Though
Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance
operation and better motivated by religious conviction

  As to retaliation
 while mistakes may be made that is still a far cry from indiscriminate
 bombing which would have produced major casualties

It may be a mixture of what we both say  Sometimes Israel chooses
its targets carefully  At other times it just sends its pilots on
sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the
attackers came from that specific village but has no further
intelligence  On several occasions Israel retalliated against
civilian refugee camps even in North Lebanon just to show
that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked
Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and
indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side
I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions
this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than
Israeli troops


 Well here we disagree  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if
 the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police
 it and prevent further attacks

I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw but I still
contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's
security since it would reduce its  military losses and I claim
that the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any
further attacks on Northern Israel


    There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
    goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such
    circumstances and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
    capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
    in all other parts of Lebanon

 No the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another
 Lebanese morass  I could elaborate if necessary

Hmm  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better
I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself  It would
be willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for
Israeli withdrawal  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be
involved in its protectorate of Lebanon  Syria is sitting at the
negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants
to get a political resolution  A renewal of hostilities
along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations
back in question


    I agree only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing
    CANNOT be qualified as murder no matter what you say

 No but it is regretable as is the whole situation


I agree that the loss of any human life is deplorable and regrettable

Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank Car
Bomb Explosion

Israel Defense Forces Radio GALEI ZAHAL reports today that a car
bomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians and
wounded eight IDF soldiers The blast is believed to be the work of
a suicide bomber Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas
exploded between two parked buses one belonging to the IDF and the
other civilian Both busses went up in flames The blast killed an
Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement
An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may
have been the one who set off the bomb According to officials at
the Haemek Hospital in Afula the eight IDF soldiers injured in the
blast suffered light to moderate injuries

In today's Israeline posting at the end an afterthought I read

 More Money Allocated to Building Infrastructure in Territories to
 Create Jobs for Palestinians

 KOL YISRAEL reports that public works geared at building
 infrastructure costing  million New Israeli Shekels about 
 million dollars will begin Sunday in the Territories This was
 announced last night by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Finance
 Minister Avraham Shohat in an effort to create more jobs for
 Palestinian residents of the Territories This infusion of money
 will bring allocations given to developing infrastructure in the
 Territories this year to  million NIS up from last year's
 figure of  million NIS

While I applaud investing of money in Yehuda Shomron v'ChevelAzza
in order to create jobs for their residents I find it deplorable that
this has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration
since  with regard to their Jewish residents Past governments
found funds to subsidize cheap read affordable housing and the
requisite infrastructure but where was the investment for creating
industry which would have generated income and jobs

After  years Yehuda and Shomron remain barren bereft of even
middlesized industries and the Jewish settlements are sterile
bedroom communities havens for in the main Israelis both
secular and religious who work in TelAviv or Jerusalem but
cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs

There's an old saying bli giboosh ayn kivoosh  just living there
wasn't enough we had to really settle it But instead we settled
for Potemkin villages and now we are paying the price and doing
for others what we should have done for ourselves



Yonatan B Horen  Jews who do not base their advocacy of Jewish positions and
     interests on Judaism are essentially racists the only
horennetcomcom  morally defensible grounds for the preservation of Jews as a
                  separate people rest on their religious identity as Jews

While that is currently true from their perspective it is also
worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer
from attempts to control the guerillas  Furthermore there were
cases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated
within villages  The argument that can be made for small arms
fire can not be made for field pieces

 Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias  Though
 Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance
 operation and better motivated by religious conviction

As I recall Amal was primarily nationalistically Lebanon for
the Lebanese motivated  I think that the difference between them
was also a matter of funding and support  One question does
come to mind however

Given that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc and
that their stated position is
	  No peace talks
	  No peace talks

I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see
Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria
could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion
would lead to a second pullout

To this day I can't understand why my husband an older man was killed What
was he killed for He hadn't hurt anyone hadn't said any word he oughtn't
have Why did they kill him I want to find outfrom here from there from
the governmentwhy my husband was killed

On the th when I returned from workit was a Saturdaymy son was at home
He doesn't work I went straight to the kitchen and he called me Mamma is
there a soccer game There were shouts from Lenin Street That's where we
lived I say I don't know Igor I haven't turned on the TV He looked
again and said Mamma what's going on in the courtyard I look and see so
many people it's awful marching marching there are hundreds thousands
you can't even tell how many there are They're shouting Down with the
Armenians Kill the Armenians Tear the Armenians to pieces My God why is
that happening what for I had known nothing at that point We lived together
well in friendship and suddenly something like this It was completely
unexpected And they were shouting Long live Turkey And they had flags
and they were shouting There was a man walking in front well dressed he's
around  or  in a gray raincoat He is walking and saying something I
can't make it out through the vent window He is walking and saying something
and the children behind him are shouting Tear the Armenians to pieces and
Down with the Armenians They shout it again and then shout Hurrah The
people streamed without end they were walking in groups and in the groups I
saw that there were women too I say My God there are women there too
And my son says Those aren't women Mamma those are bad women Well we
didn't look a long time They were walking and shouting and I was afraid I
simply couldn't sit still I went out onto the balcony and my Azerbaijani
neighbor is on the other balcony and I say Khalida what's going on what
happened She says Emma I don't know I don't know I don't know what
happened Well she was quite frightened too They had these white sticks
each second or third one had a white rod They're waving the rods above their
heads as they walk and the one who's out front like a leader he has a white
stick too Well maybe it was an armature shaft but what I saw was white I
don't know

My husband got home  or  minutes later He comes home and I say Oh
dear I'm frightened they're going to kill us I bet And he says What are
you afraid of they're just children I say Everything that happens comes
from children There had been  and year kids from the Technical and
Vocational School Don't fear he said it's nothing nothing all that
bad He didn't eat he just lay on the sofa And just then on television they
broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh near Askeran
When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all I kept walking here and
there and I said They're going to kill us the Azerbaijanis are going to
kill us And he says Don't be afraid Then we heardfrom the central
square there are women shouting near near the stage well they're shouting
different things and you couldn't hear every well I say You speak
Azerbaijani well listen to what they're saying He says Close the window
and go to bed there s nothing happening there He listened a bit and then
closed the window and went to bed and told us Come on go to sleep it's
nothing Sleep what did he mean sleep  My Son and I stood at the window
until two in the morning watching Well he's sick and all of this was
affecting him I say Igor you go to bed I'm going to go to bed in a minute
too He went and I sat at the window until three and then went to bed
Things had calmed down slightly

The th Sunday was my day off My husband got up and said Come on Emma
get up I say Today's my day off let me rest He says Aren't you going
to make me some tea Well I felt startled and got up and said Where are
you going He says I'm going out I have to I say Can you really go
outside on a day like today Don't go out for God's sake You never listen to
me I know and you're not going to listen to me now but at least don't take
the car out of the garage go without the car And he says Come on close
the door And then on the staircase he muttered something I couldn't make it
out he probably said coward or something

I closed the door and he left And I started cleaning    picking things up
around the house    Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after
noon but at the bus station my neighbor told me cars were burning I said
Khalida was it our car She says No no Emma don't be afraid they
were government cars and Zhigulis'' Our car is a GAZ Volga And I waited
it was four o'clock five o'clock    and when he wasn't home at seven I
said Oh they've killed Shagen

Tires are burning in town there's black smoke in town and I'm afraid I'm
standing on the balcony and I'm all    my whole body is shaking My God
they've probably killed him So basically I waited like that until ten
o'clock and he still hadn't come home And I'm afraid to go out At ten
o'clock I look out across from our building is a building with a bookstore
and from upstairs from the second floor everything is being thrown outside
I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other and I
don't want him to see this and he as it turns out doesn't want me to see
it We wanted to hide it from one another I joined him Mamma he says
look what they're doing over there They were burning everything and there
were police standing there  or  of them maybe twenty policemen standing
on the side and the crowd is on the other side and two or three people are
throwing everything down from the balcony And one of the ones on the balcony
is shouting What are you standing there for burn it When they threw the
television wow it was like a bomb Our neighbor on the third floor came out
on her balcony and shouted Why are you doing that why are you burning those
things those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their
home Why are you burning them And from the courtyard they yell at her Go
inside go inside Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in
your building or not They meant Armenians but they didn't say Armenians
they said of them She says No no no none Then she ran downstairs to
our place and says Emma Emma you have to leave I say They've killed
Shagen anyway what do we have to live for It won't be living for me without
Shagen Let them kill us too She insists saying Emma get out of here
go to Khalida's and give me the key When they come I'll say that it's my
daughter's apartment that they're off visiting someone I gave her the key
and went to the neighbor's but I couldn't endure it I say Igor you stay
here I'm going to go downstairs and see maybe Papa's    Papa's there

Meanwhile they were killing the two brothers Alik and Valery Albert and
Valery Avanesians see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian in
the courtyard There is a crowd near the building they're shouting howling
and I didn't think that they were killing at the time Alik and Valery lived
in the corner house across from ours When I went out into the courtyard I saw
an Azerbaijani our neighbor a young man about  years old I say Madar
Uncle Shagen's gone let's go see maybe he's dead in the garage or near the
garage let's at least bring the corpse into the house He shouts Aunt
Emma where do you think you're going Go back into the house I'll look for
him I say Something will happen to you too because of me no Madar
I'm coming too Well he wouldn't let me go all the same he says You stay
here with us I'm go look He went and looked and came back and said Aunt
Emma there's no one there the garage is closed Madar went off again and
then returned and said Aunt Emma they're already killed Alik and Valery's
there    wheezing

Madar wanted to go up to him but those scoundrels said Don't go near him
or we'll put you next to him He got scaredhe's youngand came back and
said I'm going to go call maybe an ambulance will come at least to take
Alik maybe he'll live     They grew up together in our courtyard they
knew each other well they had always been on good terms He went to call but
not a single telephone worked they had all been shut off He called and
called and called and callednothing

I went upstairs to the neighbor's Igor says Two police cars drove up over
there their headlights are on but they're not touching them they are still
lying where they were they're still lying there    We watched out the
window until four o'clock and then went downstairs to our apartment I didn't
take my clothes off I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed and at six
o'clock in the morning I got up and said Igor you stay here at home don't
go out don't go anywhere I'm going to look I have to find Papa dead or
alive    let me go    I've got the keys from work

At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital The head doctor and another
doctor opened the door to the morgue I run up to them and say Doctor is
Shagen there He says What do you mean Why should Shagen be here I
wanted to go in but he wouldn't let me There were only four people in there
they said Well they must have been awful because they didn't let me in They
said Shagen's not here he's alive somewhere he'll come back

It's already seven o'clock in the morning I look and there is a panel truck
with three policemen Some of our people from the hospital were there with
them I say Sara Baji Sister Sara term of endearment go look they've
probably brought Shagen I said it shouted it and she went and came back
and says No Emma he has tan shoes on it's a younger person Now Shagen
just happened to have tan shoes light tan they were already old When they
said it like that I guessed immediately I went and said Doctor they've
brought Shagen in dead He says Why are you carrying on like that dead
dead    he's alive But then he went all the same and when he came back
the look on his face was    I could tell immediately that he was dead They
knew one another well Shagen had worked for him a long time I say Doctor
is it Shagen He says No Emma it's not he it's somebody else entirely
I say Doctor why are you deceiving me I'll find out all the same anyway
if not today then tomorrow And he said    I screamed right there in the
office He says Emma go go calm down a little Another one of our
colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen but    in hideous
condition They tried to calm me down saying it wasn't Shagen A few minutes
later another colleague comes in and says Oh poor Emma When she said it
like that there was no hope left

   That day was awful They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured
people

At night someone took me home I said Igor Papa's been killed

On the morning of the st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital
I had to bury him somehow do something I look and see that the hospital is
surrounded by soldiers They are wearing dark clothes Hey citizen where
are you going I say I work here and from inside someone shouts Yes
yes that's our cook let her in I went right to the head doctor's office
and there is a person from the City Health Department there he used to
work with us at the hospital He says Emma Shagen's been taken to Baku
In the night they took the wounded and the dead all of them to Baku I
say Doctor how will I bury him He says We're taking care of all that
don't you worry we'll do everything we'll tell you about it Where did you
spend the night I say I was at home He says What do you mean you
were at home You were at home alone I say No Igor was there too He
says You can't stay home we're getting an ambulance right now wait just
one second the head doctor is coming we're arranging an ambulance right
now you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor you go and bring Igor here
like a patient and you'll stay here and we'll se later what to do next 
His last name is Kagramanov The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli
Sadukhov

The ambulance arrived and I went home and got Igor They admitted him as a
patient they gave us a private room an isolation room We stayed in the
hospital until the th

Some police car came and they said Emma let's go And the women our
colleagues then they saw the police car became anxious and said Where are
you taking her I say They're going to kill me too     And the
investigator says Why are you saying that we're going to make a positive
identification We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue    I
still can't remember what hospital it was    The investigator says Let's
go we need to be certain maybe it's not Shagen And when I saw the caskets
lying on top of one another I went out of my mind I say I can't look no
The investigator says Are there any identifying marks I say Let me see
the clothes or the shoes or even a sock I'll recognize them He says
Isn't they're anything on his body I say he has seven gold teeth and his
finger he only has half of one of his fingers Shagen was a carpenter he had
been injured at work   

They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing they
brought them and they were all burned    When I saw them I shouted Oh
they burned him I shouted I don't know I fell down    or maybe I sat
down I don't remember And that investigator says Well fine fine since
we've identified that these are his clothes and since his teeth    since
he has seven gold teeth    

On the th they told me Emma it's time to bury Shagen now I cried How
how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick I should inform
his relatives he has three sisters I can't do it by myself They say OK
you know the situation How will they get here from Karabagh How will they
get here from Yerevan There's no transportation it s impossible

He was killed on February  and I buried him on March  We buried him in
Sumgait They asked me Where do you want to bury him I said I want to
bury him in Karabagh where we were born let me bury him in Karabagh I'm
shouting and the head of the burial office I guess says Do you know what
it means take him to Karabagh It means arson I say What do you mean
arson Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh The whole world knows that
they killed them and I want to take him to Karabagh I don't have anyone
anymore I begged I pleaded I grieved I even got down on my knees He
says Let's bury him here now and in three months in six months a year
if it calms down I'll help you move him to Karabagh    

Our trial was the first in Sumgait It was concluded on May  At the
investigation the murderer Tale Ismailov told how it all happened but then
at the trial he    tried to wriggle    he tried to soften his crime
Then they brought a videotape recorder I guess and played it and said
Ismailov look is that you He says Yes Well look here you're
describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime right He says
Yes And now you're telling it differently He says Well maybe I
forgot Like that

The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going
along Mir Street there was a crowd of about  people    Shagen had a
Volga GAZ The  people surrounded his car and all  of them were
involved One of them was this Ismailov guy this Tale Theyit's unclear
whostarted pulling Shagen out of the car Well one says from the left side
of the car another says from the right side They pulled off his sports
jacket He had a jacket on Well they ask him What's your nationality He
says Armenian Well they say from the crowd they shouted If he's an
Armenian kill him kill him They started beating him they broke seven of
his ribs and his heart    I don't know they did something there too
   it's too awful to tell about Anyway they say this Tale guy    he
had an armature shaft He says I picked it up it was lying near a bush
that's where I got it He said he picked it up but the witnesses say that he
had already had it He said I hit him twice he said     once or twice
on the head with that rod And he said that when he started to beat him
Shagen was sitting on the ground and when he hit him he fell over He said
I left right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment
killing someone he says and I came back to look is that Shagen alive or
not I said You wanted to finish him right and if he was still alive you
came back to hit him again He went back and looked and he was already dead
After that that bastard Tale said after that I went home

I said You    you    little snake I said Are you a thief and a
murderer Shagen had had money in his jacket and a watch on his wrist They
were taken He says he didn't take them

When they overturned and burned the car that Tale was no longer there it was
other people who did that Who it was who turned over the car and who burned
it that hasn't been clarified as yet I told the investigator How can you
have the trial when you don't know who burned the car He said something but
I didn't get what he was saying But I said You still haven't straightened
everything out I think that's unjust

When they burned the car he was lying next to it and the fire spread to him
In the death certificate it says that he had thirddegree burns over 
percent of his body   

And I ask again why was he killed My husband was a carpenter he was a good
craftsman he knew how to do everything he even fixed his own car with his
own hands We have three children Three sons Only Igor was with me at the
time The older one was in Pyatigorsk and the younger one is serving in the
Army And now they're fatherless

I couldn't sit all the way through it When the Procurator read up to 
years' deprivation of freedom I just    I went out of my mind I didn't
know what to do with myself I said How can that be You I said you are
saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is  years'
deprivation of freedom I screamed I had my mind I said Let me at that
creep with my bare hands I'll     A relative restrained me and there
were all those military people there    I lest I said This isn't a
Soviet trial this is unjust That's what I shouted l said it and left   

I said that on February  when those people were streaming down our street
they were shouting Long live Turkey and Glory to Turkey And during the
trial I said to that Ismailov What does that mean 'Glory to Turkey' I
still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this we live in the Soviet
Union That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians I still
don't understand why Glory to Turkey I asked that question twice and got no
answer    No one answered me

I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that
totally destroys Begin's whitewash  I have no particular desire
to post it yet again

Brendan
normally bdmcsanueduau


You apparently think you are some sort of oneman judge and jury who
can declare total victory and then sit back and enjoy the
applause  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few
rigged quotations can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir
Yassin massacre

You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology
At the most basic level you should know that there is a big
difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding
quotations that support your preset opinions

If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that
many of the sources of your quotations have an axe to grind and
therefore you must be very careful about whom you quote  For
example Meir Pa'il whom you cite was indeed a general a scholar
and a war hero  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of
his mouth is gold  In fact and here your lack of experience
shows Pa'il is such a fanatic embittered leftist that much of his
antiIsrael blathering forget about antiIrgun blathering would be
considered something like treason in nonIsrael contexts  But of
course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy
quotation that you can use to attack Israel

Benny Morris of Hashomer Hatzair represents himself as a scholar
when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun  Don't be fooled
It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight surfacing as an
attack on the then Likud government  If you will look closely at
the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence
you will see his indictment to be pure hot air  And this is the
BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning
evidence  Unfortunately for him because his book parades itself as
scholarly he is forced to put footnotes  So you can clearly see
that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing

The Deir Yassin massacre never took place as the propagandists
tell it any more than the Sabra and Shatila massacres Do you get
the feeling people like to blame the Jews for massacres even if
they have to make them up  It must sound spicy  Even some Jews
like to do it for reasons of their own

Please don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin massacre stuff
with facts or scholarship  You should stick to Begin's version
unless you find something serious to contradict it

If indeed Israeli soldiers killed a Hamas Mujahid with an antitank missile
then I'm almost sure that the terrorist zionists would not have been able
to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the missile

maybe the missile didn't hit directly such that his body
gets desintegrated  of course destroying  houses to
kill someone is not a surgical operation or is it

I've heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they don't read about
itRemember the Treaty of Sevresas a consequence of being in the Axis powers
in WWIThe Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their
minorities ie GreeksArmeniansKurdsI must say TurkKurd relations are
improving slightly with time and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours
The Turks blatantly rejected this treatythe Germans grudgingly accepted
Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the
German peopleThe Greeks who had an army therewere there with BRITISH
and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres
    In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government
managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak alliesthis was after
the Greek forces were were destroyed at SmyrnaWhen this occurred incidently
FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the
FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH
as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships
Libertaeegalitaefraternatae
It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading I think
that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres First thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the
Republic of Turkey The new independence movement which by the way is not the same as the Young Turks naturally rejected it out of hand to say that we
should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler Second the Sevres treaty was even
worse than Versailles It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence
zones had the capital occupied the economy under Allied control the army di
minished to nothing but a police force in short a country in name only I'd
wonder if you would like to live under such conditions And for the record I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour Before evacuating the
city the Greek forces burned it down so it serves them right
As for being fooled by Allied promises that too is your fault You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder  as well

no compulsion in religion

I wonder if the seven Islamic fundamentalist who have just been sentenced
to death in Egypt would agree with this assessment of Islam  Certainly they
don't feel like Jews have the right to practice Judaism in Israel  Let's not
forget that during the Jordanian occupation  of the West Bank and Jerusalem
Jews were not allowed into Jerusalem even to pray at the Western Wall the most
holy site to Jews


Does Judaism permit freedom of religion

Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin
or in Sabra and Shatila If so then let me tell you some good jokes

There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII

Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more

In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place

People die that is all No one gets killed

Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american
napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all

Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in therethey
may be thought it was like snifing cocaine No

What do you think of this  Isn't it stupid to say so
Well it is as stupid as what you said Next time you want to lie do it
intelligently

Sincerely yours

Hassan

Only Brendan McKay or maybe ARF would come to the rescue of Nazi
racial theory  Is it distressing Brendan  The point is that any
eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks
of pure Nazism  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire problem
as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East
and that he buried a slam against US aid to Israel in the midst of
his evenhanded solution of the Jewish Question made it obvious what
he had in mind disolving the Jewish polity  That is a Nazi doctrine
rectification of the abnormal presence of the Jewish people within a
larger body politic  Whether your solution involves gas monetary
incentives to the poor Jews to marry out or as Feisal Husseini has
said disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal
surrounding Arab culture you are engaged in a Nazi project

Just as obvious is your statement I will not comment on the value
or lack of value of Elias's proposal  Still striking the glancing
blow right Brendan  You could easily see where he was going but you
will not comment  So you are complicitous

What is your fascination with Nazi racial theory anyway

A unconventional proposal for peace in the MiddleEast
 by
			  Elias Davidsson

      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'
marriages in IsraelPalestine all of whom would have relatives on
'both sides' of the divide would make the conflict lose its
ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a
truly civil society The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of
people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the

    Sounds just like a racial theory that Hitler outlined in Mein Kampf

Someone else said something similar  I will not comment on the
value or lack of value of Elias's proposal  I just want to say
that it is very distressing that at least two people here are
profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine  They were NOT
like Elias's idea they were more like the opposite

Nazis believed in racial purity not racial assimilation  An
instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies  According to
Nazi theoreticians Gypsies were an Aryan race  They were persecuted
and in huge numbers murdered because most European Gypies were
considered not pure Gypsies but mongrels formed from the pure Gypsy
race and other undesirable races  This was the key difference between
the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies by the way  It is also
true that towards the end of WWII even the purist Gypsies were
hunted down as the theory was forgotten

 There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor
until  Someone had to protect them If not us who


Is that so or you were taking advantage of weakness of ottoman
empire to grab some land As soon as you got green lights from
allied forces you occupied Izmir and other cities in western
Turkey You killed and  raped millions people without any reason
Of course you paid the price Mustafa Kemal Ataturk made
you swim in aegean sea but not far enough Your aggressions thru
Turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall
not get you anywhere


Don't swallow propaganda as truth Sir British promised to Venizelos
greek PM that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be
given to Greece if he will agree to drag Greece in the side of
the British during the WWI because the greek King was proGerman
The British succeeded by bombarding Athens  killing quite a few
forcing abdication of the King division of Greece into two separate
states NorthSouth and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous
division between greeks for our centurySo don't feel bitter that the
Allies gave any green light because they liked us

Anyway the British succeed to establish Venizelos war starts at a second
front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war
in the East against the Russians and finally the WWII came in an end
After that the British and French forgot immediately their promises
as usually Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek
cause practically they not only do nothing but instead using some usual
reasoning and other crap rhetoric as a pretext they gradually
backup Kemal who had given now to the British water and bread that
he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small
ethnicstate The main drive behind this British switch was the plan
to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion
into warmwater facilities The greek empire being an Orthodox Christian
state was too prone to become Russian client

Out of this intrigue the current state of affairs was established on our
lands While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true Giants by the
British since they worked to realize their goals in the region
Under the same plan currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big
military funds from the US both they are functioning as antiRussian
buffers while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept because
otherwise the use of terror of changing the balance of power in the Aegean
will be used

Under the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem

Gr

PS I don't make any antiwhatever rhetoric This is the situation
    in our region and needs to be said The previously mentioned powers
    are not anything special they are fucntioning the same way which
    anyone else functions all throughout history So I don't selectively
    single them out just they are relevant to our current afairs

   ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES

By David Ljunggren

MOSCOW April  Reuter  Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons
x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it
might try to shoot the planes down local journalists in Yerevan said

Separately ItarTass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest
offensive which has swallowed up onetenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in
the Transcaucasian region soaring

The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan head of the
Armenian defence ministry press centre as saying Ankara had been sending
planes up to  times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops

It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about
the impermissibility of such actions the journalists quoted Duliyan as
saying

If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate
measures We have all the necessary means including modern antiaircraft
units

Turkey which shares a border with Armenia has supported Azerbaijan in the
conflict over the mainly Armenianpopulated NagornoKarabakh region in which
more than  people have been killed since fighting erupted in 

The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to
Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid

A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly
on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets rocket
launchers ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey

Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to  trucks a day carrying troops
and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan from where
they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku

All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the
country which is affording military assistance over our airspace he said

Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict saying that the troops
involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself

Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive
along the entire ArmenianAzerbaijani front

The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent
inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the enclave's
leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire the agency said

Armenian President Levon TerPetrosyan called for a twostage ceasefire in
Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of
Commonwealth leaders

The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the
protection of the Karabakh population Tass quoted him as saying

At least  ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have
collapsed

The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the
legal issues that is a clarification of the status of NagornoKarabakh he
said The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not
been recognised by any other country

Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future
peace talks something Azerbaijan rejects

Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender
Gamidov a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with
Armenia had resigned

Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office
KhabarServis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of
Baku police MajorGeneral Abdullah Allakhverdiyev There was no official
confirmation

Dear friends

I am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee As part of
the requirements for a research class in music education I designed a
questionnaire to colect data for my research project The study intends to
determine which techniques if any have been used to teach music for the deaf

If you have any experience in music education for the deaf and would like to
help me with this project your help would be very much appreciated

If you also want to exchange some ideas about the subject matter feel yourself
welcome I have been working in this area for a while in Brazil  by the way
I am Brazilian  and also in US and I am very pleased with the results

I hope that this inquiry will not cause too many inconveniences Thank you for
or time and consideration

Great interview with Benjamin Netanyahu on CNN  Larry King Live 
This guy is knows what he is talking about He is truely charismatic

I agree  he looked and sounded very western
I did not quite follow one thing that he said  He referred to a
ten mile stretch that would remain of Israel if the occupied
territories were given away  Is that really true I mean are the
territories that significant in area or did I get lost in the discussion
Could someone enlighten me on this

			Yarn of Cargo of Human Bones

			Special Cable to The New York Times

   PARIS Dec   Marseilles is excited by a weird story of the arrival in
that port of a ship flying the British flag and named Zan carrying a
mysterious cargo of  tons of human bones consigned to manufacturers there
The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and
to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor In view of the
rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated

 New York Times December   page  column  bottom

			           

On the th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians
we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an
emerging Turkish protofascist state In their names we demand justice

In April  the Turkish government began a systematically executed
depopulation of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a
genocidal extermination This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey The
result  million murdered  billion dollars of Armenian property stolen
and plundered This genocide ended nearly  years of Armenian civilization
on those lands Today the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands Today's Turkish
governmental policy is to rewrite the history of the era to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people In
the face of refutation ad nauseam the Turkish Historical Society and cronies
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred This policy
merely demonstrates that in the modern era genocide is an effective state
policy when it remains unredressed and unpunished A crime unpunished is a
crime encouraged Adolf Hitler took this cue less than  years after the
successful genocide of the Armenians

Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians yet
Armenians were removed from every city town and village in the whole of
Turkey Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as
rebels

Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians yetTurkish population
figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey the Armenian homeland

Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority yetTurkey claims
Armenians were a threat

In a final insult to the victims the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of
approximately  murdered Armenians for profit to Europe

Today the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide The
success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish
population

The Armenians demand recognition reparation return of Armenian land and
property lost as a result of this genocide

The student of regional killings alias Davidian not the Davidian religios sect writes


Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh to the Black Sea to the
Mediterranean so if you use the term Greater Armenia use it with care


	Finally you said what you dream about Mediterranean That was new
	The area will be greater after some years like your holocaust numbers




It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh
by removing the Armenians When the president of Azerbaijan Elchibey came to
power last year he announced he would be be swimming in Lake Sevan in
Armeniaxn by July
		
	Is't July in USA now Here in Sweden it's April and still cold
	Or have you changed your calendar


Well he was wrong If Elchibey is going to shell the
Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam his people will pay the price If Elchibey
						    
is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price If
						    
Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of
Kelbajar his people will pay the price
			    


	NOTHING OF THE MENTIONED IS TRUE BUT LET SAY IT's TRUE

	SHALL THE AZERI WOMEN AND CHILDREN GOING TO PAY THE PRICE WITH
						    
	BEING RAPED KILLED AND TORTURED BY THE ARMENIANS

	HAVE YOU HEARDED SOMETHING CALLED GENEVA CONVENTION
	YOU FACIST



	Ohhh i forgot this is how Armenians fight nobody has forgot
	you killings rapings and torture against the Kurds and Turks once
	upon a time



And anyway this 
Kurd refugee story as have other stories are simple fabrications sourced in
Baku modified in Ankara Other examples of this are Armenia has no border
with Iran and the ridiculous story of the intercepting of Armenian military
conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by
somebody unknown from Armenian into Azeri Turkish submitted by an unnamed
special correspondent to the NY Times from Baku Real accurate

Ohhhh so swedish RedCross workers do lie they too What ever you say
regional killer if you don't like the person then shoot him that's your policyl


HE	Search Turkish planes You don't know what you are talking about
HE	since it's content is announced to be weapons 				i
										i
Well big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan	i
from Turkey yet Demirel and others say no No wonder you are so confused	i
										i
										i
	Confused								i
	You facist when you delete text don't change it i wrote		i
										i
        Search Turkish planes You don't know what you are talking about	i
        Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons  i
        to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
        it self not the Karabag province So why search a plane for weapons
        since it's content is announced to be weapons

	If there is one that's confused then that's you We have the right and we do
	to give weapons to the Azeris since Armenians started the fight in Azerbadjan


You are correct all Turkish planes should be simply shot down Nice slow
moving air transports

	Shoot down with what Armenian bread and butter Or the arms and personel
	of the Russian army

 	WASHINGTON UPI  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday
 there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than
 ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs but a frustrated senator
 told him to do just that

  Oh great

  Today's headlines tell us that the Croatians and Bosnians are fighting
  each other throughout central Bosnia in battles that the UN describes
  as out of control and atrocities being reported from both sides
  These people are crazy

  Right now the Serbians are Number One in violations of human rights
  and general carnage but crazed violence in the Balkans is like the
  carrental business  if you're Number Two you just try harder

  The region doesn't need military aid it needs psychiatric help
  We should bomb them with Thorazine and then airdrop several
  regiments of psychotherapists

  There is no justification for US military involvement because there
  is no reasonable definable goal we can achieve militarily  Sure
  if send in several divisions of mechanized infantry we can probably
  stop the more egregious fighting but only as long as we are willing
  to stay in there and play policeman and get shot at  The minute we
  leave or turn our backs they'll be at each other's throats again

  BTW with Bosnia's large Moslem population why have nations like
  Turkey Saudi Arabia Syria Egypt and others with either money
  or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered
  to help out Bosnia   The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said
  a thing or two but that's all I see no great enthusism from any
  of those places to get their hands dirty    Why does the US always
  get stuck with this stuff

  Besides there's no case that can be made for US military involvement
  there that doesn't apply equally well to say Liberia Angola or
  it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign Cambodia   Nonwhites
  don't count

I know nothing about statistics but what significance does the
relatively small population growth rate have where the sampling period
is so small at the end of 

This is not small A  per cent annual population growth rate implies
a doubling in  approx  years Can you imagine that Most people
seem not able to and that is why so many deny that this problem exists
for me most especially in the industrialised countries low growth rates
but large environmental impact Iran's high growth rate threatens things
like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture deforestation
and water table drop Similar to what is going on in California this year's
rain won't save you in Stanford This is probably more to blame than
the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards
in Iran

I spent almost all of February doing overhaul The th was a short day at
work we worked until eleven or eleventhirty and left for home I decided
to go for a short walk I went to Primorsky Park I walked past the Eternal
Flame and saw a group of about  to  people standing there When I had
walked another  to  yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes
behind me I turned my head toward the sound It was a light blue GAZ
Volga I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the
car A man and a woman get out The man is expensively dressed in a suit
and the woman has a raincoat on She doesn't have anything on her head and
her hair is let down sightly reddish hair a heavyset woman They're  to
 years old They get something out of the trunk The people start to help
them I become curious just what are they pulling out of there

When I got up close I heard them turn something on I didn't see what it was
but it was probably a tape recorder They put it on the ground near the
Eternal Flame honoring the  Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle
around it I ask What's going on Someone tells me Come listen Well
they were Azerbaijanis I had asked in Azerbaijani I hear appeals Brother
Muslims our time has come     and something else along that line I
didn't understand what it was all about I walked around the group trying to
get a look at the owner of the tape recorder But the circle drew in tighter
New people started coming from various directions five here seven there And
the comments started Right we should slaughter the Armenians and There's
no need to be afraid all of Moscow is behind us I even heard that All
Moscow is behind us Well I watched and listened in and realized that this
was no joke I quietly left and went home

Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh
that there were demonstrations there Well people were saying all kinds of
things but I didn't have any idea what was really going on

My wife and son were at home but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku
I didn't say anything to my wife We sat and drank tea Sometime around two
o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise whistling and
shouting I looked out the window and saw a crowd The crowd is moving slowly
like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a
demonstration and move slowly

My wife asks what's going on out there I say I don't know I put on some
outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about In the crowd
people are shouting Down with the Armenians and Death to the Armenians I
waited for the entire crowd to pass At first they went down Narimanov Street
on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee then they turned
and went against the trafficit's one way theredown the Street of the 
Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line I went home and told my wife there
was a demonstration going on In fact I thought that we were having the same
kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh Aside
from the things they were shouting I was surprised that there were only young
people in the crowd And they were minors under draft age

My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend but I was kind of
uneasy and said No let's stay at home instead An hour went by or maybe
an hour and a half Well I wasn't keeping track of the time I can't say
exactly how long it was I look and see another crowd on Narimanov but now on
the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the Rossiya movie theater

I put outside clothes on and went out again There's noise an uproar outside
and the crowd has grown There are more people And whereas the first time
there were individual shouts this time they are more focused more
aggressive No I think something's wrong here this isn't any demonstration
They would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dashes and then run
again I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street I
followed them I was thinking I'd just watch and see Who knew where this was
leading We came out on Lenin Square At the square the SK club is on one
side and the City Party Committee is on the other I went toward the square
and heard noise and shouting as though the whole town had turned out There
was some sort of a rally going on I go closer and hear exclamations appeals
I heard both antiArmenian and antiSoviet appeals We don't need
perestroika we want to go on living like we have been Now what did they
mean by living like we have been The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else
But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense
of others Speculation theft and cheating go on all the time And not just
in Azerbaijan everywhere in all the republics but I've never seen it
anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan

Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'
apartments and drive them out beat them and drive them out True I didn't
hear them say kill them over the microphone I only heard beat them and
drive them out I stayed at the square a few minutes longer First one then
another are going up onto the stage and no one tries to stop the crowd Off
to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people and
I think they were MVD Ministry of Internal Affairs or State Security KGB
There were also uniformed policemen there but I didn't see any of them try
to pacify the crowd New people kept coming up onto the stage

Well I had finally decided that this could end badly This was no
demonstration and I had to protect my family

I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck It was next
to the City Party Committee on Narimanov Street it stood next to the tai
lor's shop there a low truck and it had low wooden panels I see that some
thing is being unloaded crates of some sort I decided to go look because
after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons
in there They pulled the crates out onto the square not toward the City
Party Committee but toward the SK club And when I went right up to them I
saw that they were cases of vodka There were two people handing down the
cases from the bed of the truck and on the ground there were many people 
to  They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried
off by two people Two people one case of vodka And there was a man standing
right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps maybe
about the size of a fist maybe a little bigger or smaller It was anasha
When I passed next to that person he stood with his side to me There was
about a yard and a half between us and two people were standing near him He
has a package in his hand and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out I
have never smoked it myself Once I tried it for fun but I've seen a lot of
people smoke it I've seen it many times and I know what it is I strolled
around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there

Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling more warlike shouting
I turned around and saw them running Well I'll just keep on going like I am
I thought When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags
And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the
street He's a young guy  or  years old He was carrying a red flag
which had Ermeni oryum written on it in Azerbaijani that means Death to
Armenians That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us I don't really
know what his name is but I know his father very well His father's name is
Rafik he used to be a cook and then became head chef He used to have a dark
blue Zhiguli van then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli  His
family as I said lived on the same courtyard as we did Our building was on
Narimanov Street and theirs was on the Street of the  Baku Commissars
their apartment was in the far entryway on the fifth floor the door on the
left Now Rafik's little brother lives there and he Rafik I heard got a
new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict In a word his son
was carrying a flag that said Death to Armenians I was surprised because
before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being
done not by people from Sumgait but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan

Well anyway I went home My wife was upset I told her It's OK it'll pass
they're young kids they've just gotten all whooped up Naturally I didn't
want her to get overly upset After a while a new surge of crowd went by And
this time they were breaking glass I could hear it breaking but I couldn't
see where Well I think here we go the machine's in motion They weren't
handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing I didn't see people drinking
and smoking on the spot but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and
hashish to put in a store window

So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running no one
would stop them now they weren't even trying although I'll say it again
the police were there I saw them And it's not just that the police weren't
breaking them up they were joking with them they were having a good time
True at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government our much
vaunted leadershipand I'm not afraid to say these words so many people
died So many women were abused and how many abominations there wereI
couldn't imagine that under our muchvaunted authorities and if I were to be
specific I would say under the muchtouted authorities in our city of
Sumgait I couldn't imagine that such things could take place

When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son Let's go upstairs
We went to our neighbors the Grigorians on the fourth floor And in the
evening when those crowds started going past again I went outside once more
I stopped at The Corner a place called that right next to the bazaar I
look and see a crowd on the run And there a few yards from the entrance to
the bazaar are three respectablelooking men of around say  years old
The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed
toward the bazaar And then the whole crowd as though it were one person
wheeled and raced toward the bazaar And not a soul went past those three as
though it were off limits Well everything got all churned up there was more
noise and the glass was flying again

We spent the night at the neighbors' My apartment was on the first floor
there was really no way to defend yourself there

In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town
On the way I saw someone hunched up still I never found out who it was or
what happened to him There were  to  people standing near him I got the
bread and on my way back they had gathered around the person who was lying
there hunched up sort of enclosing him because of the way they were standing
you couldn't even see him

That was on the morning of February  Everyone knows the rest

	WASHINGTON UPI  A senior State Department official on Tuesday
ruled out any softening of US attitudes toward Iraq but said relations
with Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if that
government disassociates itself from international terrorism
	Despite the namecalling and the harsh rhetoric from across the
Gulf despite all this we do not take a position of permanent hostility
towards the Islamic Republic of Iran'' David Mack deputy assistant
secretary for Near Eastern Affairs said
	The primary US objection is Iran's international behaviour''
which includes extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab
Israeli peace process and its rapid buildup of dangerous weapons
	Mack said Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but
first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area''
	Mack spoke at the USGCC business conference aimed at promoting
GulfAmerican trade He said the Middle East will be an item very high
on the agenda of the US administration''
	The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren
Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere
else in the world Mack said He added that the US has no longterm
plan to station troops in the Gulf
	Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to
pressure Iraq to comply with all the UN Security resolutions''
	As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect
compliance'' Mack told delegates

Today marks the th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of
 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and xSoviet
Armenia The following letter which represents a small portion
of the full text along with more than  pages of historical
documents scholarly sources eyewitness accounts and photographs
was sent to President Bill Clinton members of Congress editors
program directors and columnists of major newspapers journals and
radioTV stations for the th anniversary of the Armenian genocide
of  million Muslim people On April  of every year the people
of Turkiye remember their dead They grieve for lost family and the
lost homes of their grandfathers This year the Turkish Nation is
mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their
lives generously and with altruism so that the future generations
may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and
prosperously

 letter 

During the years of World War I the xSoviet Armenian Government
has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people which
not only took the lives of  million Muslim people but was also the
method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants To this day
Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the xSoviet Armenia In order
to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland
which is the crux of Turkish political demands fascist xSoviet Armenia
continues its antiTurkish policy in the following ways

 xSoviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility

 xSoviet Armenia employing ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism
Triangle attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish
Genocide

 xSoviet Armenia has also implemented statesponsored terrorism through
the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests

 Using all its human financial and governmental resources xSoviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism bribery and other subversive methods nonTurkish supporters
of the Turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian

Using all the aforementioned methods the xSoviet Armenian Government
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue

Yet despite the efforts of the xSoviet Armenian Government and its
terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically
exterminated by the Armenians the international wall of silence on
this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition
of the Turkish Genocide

With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages the Turkish and Kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle therefore the victims
of the Turkish Genocide demand

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government as the heirs of the Armenian
Dictatorship recognize the Turkish Genocide

 that xSoviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government make material reparations for
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide

 that all world governments and especially the United States officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure

 that the US Government free itself from the friendly position it
has adopted towards its unreliable ally xSoviet Armenia and officially
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands

 that the xSoviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact
of the Turkish Genocide and include the coldblooded extermination of
 million Muslim people in their history books

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first
genocide of the th century as a positive step Furthermore a new
generation has risen  equipped with a deep sense of commitment politically
mature and conscious who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause through
all necessary means ranging from the political and diplomatic to the
armed struggle Therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon
all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in
the political cultural and religious activities of the th Anniversary
of the Armenian genocide of  million Muslim people

   For your information Islam permits freedom of religion  there is
no compulsion in religion  Does Judaism permit freedom of religion
ie are nonJews recognized in Judaism  Just wondering

Steve

Actually Islam postulates that the Jews have deliberately falsified the
written Bible for nefarious purposes and thus the Jewish claim to the
Land of Israel is nullified  That does not leave much room for Jews
to manuever whether they live as dhimmis in Dar alIslam or as enemies
in Dar alHar

Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto 


While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto they
repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
attempt to starve the Gazans

The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks
The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza some  people by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel

While Polish nonJews risked their lives to save Jews from the
Ghetto no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
the Gazan resistance The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice A population denied basic human rights is entitled to
rise up against its tormentors

As is known the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of
Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel although they are
considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels shops
and fields Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in
Israel They may not live there for these areas are reserved for
the Master Race

The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the
right to self administration  They selected Jews to pacify the
occupied population and preventing any form of resistance Some
Jewish collaborators were killed Israel also wishes to rule over
Gaza through Arab collaborators

As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible
with basic human rights and international law that of becoming
Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
selfdetermination it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish
society does not consider Gazans full human beings This attitude
is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews The
current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are
consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister
Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea' One is led to ask
oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister
goals towards the Gazans  Whether they have some Final Solution
up their sleeve 

I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
they can to help the Gazans regain their full human civil and
political rights to which they are entitled as human beings

The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza some  people by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel

While Polish nonJews risked their lives to save Jews from the
Ghetto no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
the Gazan resistance The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice A population denied basic human rights is entitled to
rise up against its tormentors

As is known the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of
Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel although they are
considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels shops
and fields Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in
Israel They may not live there for these areas are reserved for
the Master Race

The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the
right to self administration  They selected Jews to pacify the
occupied population and preventing any form of resistance Some
Jewish collaborators were killed Israel also wishes to rule over
Gaza through Arab collaborators

As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible
with basic human rights and international law that of becoming
Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
selfdetermination it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish
society does not consider Gazans full human beings This attitude
is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews The
current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are
consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister
Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea' One is led to ask
oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister
goals towards the Gazans  Whether they have some Final Solution
up their sleeve 

I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
they can to help the Gazans regain their full human civil and
political rights to which they are entitled as human beings

Zionism and the Holocaust
 by Haim Bresheeth

The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history
of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without
antisemitism is impossible Zionism agrees with the basic tenet
of antiSemitism namely that Jews cannot live with non Jews

The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way While
the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 
its roots were firmly placed in the th Century Jewish
aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles
in Europe When the hopes for liberation through
bourgeoisdemocratic change were dashed other alternatives for
improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence

The socialist Bund a mass movement with enormous following had
to contend with opposition from a new and small almost
insignificant opponent the political Zionists  In outline these
two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe
While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of
Europe's workers the Zionists were proposing a new programme
aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a
Jewish state

Historically nothing is inevitable all depends on the balance of
forces involved in the struggle History can be seen as an option
tree every time a certain option is chosen other routes become
barred Because of that choice movement backwards to the point
before that choice was made is impossible While Zionism as an
option was taken by many young Jews it remained a minority
position until the first days of the rd Reich The Zionist
Federation of Germany ZVfD an organisation representing a tiny
minority of German Jews was selected by the Nazis as the body to
represent the Jews of the Reich Its was the only flag of an
interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin and this was
the only international organisation allowed to operate during this
period From a marginal position the leaders of the Zionist
Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that
surprised even them All of a sudden they attained political
power power based not on representation but from being selected
as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish
problem' Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements
that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in
Germany transformed them from a utopian marginal organisation in
Germany and some other countries in Europe into a real option to
be considered by German Jews

The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 
Immediately after the Nazi takeover in  Jews all over the
world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German
goods This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German
authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott
It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull
out the campaign would collapse

This problem was solved by the ZVfD A letter sent to the Nazi
party as early as   June  outlined the degree of agreement
that existed between the two organisations on the question of
race nation and the nature of the 'Jewish problem' and it
offered to collaborate with the new regime

The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of
Jews abroad against the German development Boycott propaganda 
such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many
ways  is in essence unZionist because Zionism wants not to do
battle but to convince and build

In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new
regime the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott
The main public act was the signature of the Transfer Agreement
with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of  In
essence the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of
the country and into Mandate Palestine It provided a possibility
for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the
country through a transfer of German goods to Palestine This
right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination The
Zionist organisation was the acting agent through its financial
organisations This agreement operated on a number of fronts 
'helping' Jews to leave the country breaking the ring of the
boycott exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine
and last but not least enabling the regime to be seen as humane
and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies the Jews After
all they argued the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the
Jews come and agree with them

After news of the agreement broke the boycott was doomed If the
Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with
the Nazis and import their goods who could argue for a boycott 
This was not the first time that the interests of both movements
were presented to the German public as complementary Baron Von
Mildenstein the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS
later followed by Eichmann was invited to travel to Palestine
This he did in early  in the company of a Zionist leader
Kurt Tuchler Having spent six months in Palestine he wrote a
series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new
Jew' of Zionism a Jew Nazis could accept and understand

This littleknown episode established quite clearly the
relationship during the early days of Nazism between the new
regime and the ZVfD a relationship that was echoed later in a
number of key instances even after the nature of the Final
Solution became clear In many cases this meant a silencing of
reports about the horrors of the exterminations A book
concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the
Holocaust is PostUgandan Zionism in the Crucible of the
Holocaust by S B BethZvi

In the case of the Kastner episode around which Jim Allen's play
PERDITION is based even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of
the real nature of events does not exist It occured near the end
of the war The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany Italy and
the African bases had been lost The Nazis were on the run with a
number of key countries such as Rumania leaving the Axis A
second front was a matter of months away as the western Allies
prepared their forces In the midst of all this we find Eichmann
the master bureaucrat of industrial murder setting up his HZ in
occupied Budapest after the German takeover of the country in
April  His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish
leadership and to appoint Zionist Federation members headed by
Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their
relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities Why they did
this is not difficult to see As opposed to Poland where its
three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly
different from the rest of the Polish population the Hungarian
Jews were an integrated part of the community The middle class
was mainly Jewish the Jews were mainly middleclass They enjoyed
freedom of travel served in the Hungarian fascist army in
fronline units as officers and soldiers their names were
Hungarian  how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be
exterminated  The task was not easy there were a million Jews in
Hungary most of them resident the rest being refugees from other
countries Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere and
were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials

Like elsewhere the only people who had the information and the
ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat In this
case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members
Without their help the SS with  officers and less than  men
plus a few hundred Hungarian police could not have collected and
controlled a million Jews when they did not even know their
whereabouts Kastner and the others were left under no illusions
Eichmann told Joel Brand one of the members of Kastner's
committee that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to
Auschwitz before he even started the expulsions  He told them
clearly that all these Jews will die  a day unless certain
conditions were met

The Committee faced a simple choice  to tell the Jews of Hungary
about their fate with neutral Rumania where many could escape
being in most cases a few hours away or to collaborate with the
Nazis by assisting in the concentration process What would not
have been believed when coming from the SS sounded quite
plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership
Thus it is that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their
death assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to
work camps

To be sure there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of
destruction the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to
Kastner  a promise he kept to the last detail For Eichmann it
was a bargain allowing  Jews to survive as the price paid
for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million
Jews

There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be
located not to say murdered without the full collaboration of
Kastner and his few friends No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews
here and there but the scale of the operation would have been
miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz

It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration
like say Rumkovsky in Lodz Kastner acted as a result of his
strongly held Zionist convictions His actions were a logical
outcome of earlier positions This is instanced when he exposed to
the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs Palgi
and Senesh and persuaded them to give themselves up so as not to
disrupt his operations At no point during his trial or elsewhere
did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those
Jews

To conclude the role played by Zionists in this period was
connected to another role they could and should have played that
of alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe They
had the information but politically it was contrary to their
priorities The priorities were and still are quite simple All
that furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed
whatever the price The lives of individuals Jews and nonJews
are secondary If this process requires dealing with fascists
Nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world so
be it

Subject Hebrew labor racist connotations


AVODA IVRIT  HEBREW LABOR


Hebrew labor is a concept which has served the Zionist movement
for a long time  It has a doublebarreled message  The new Jew
must learn to do physical labor ie working the land  The
land in this country must pass into Jewish hands ie to the same
new Jew who has learned to work it Both aspects of the
twopronged concept of Hebrew labor have racist connotations On
the one hand the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical
labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites  On the other
hand its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the
Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood

The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from
the occupied territories to the factories orchards and
hothouses of Israel relegated the myth of Hebrew labor to the
history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement It
has blossomed forth anew however as the government's answer to
problems caused by the closure of the territories Today too this
concept has two functions  to give a progressive look to the
closing of the Palestinian population  Or in the words of
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid I have no tears for those who
get rich off of cheap labor  to furnish an answer to the
unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for
wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives

The Israeli government is considering plans to import labor from
the far East to replace native people Palestinians who work in
their own country thus creating conflicting interests between two
ethnical communities and ruling over them

NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE

	 INQUIRY Transcripts reveal nearly  years of espionage
	  by a man who infiltrated political groups

By Richard C Paddock Times staff writer

SAN FRANCISCO  To the outside world Roy Bullock was a smalltime
art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District  In
reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and
amassed secret files for the AntiDefamation League for nearly 
years

His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal and he was
so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen
to head an ArabAmerican delegation that visited Rep Nancy Pelosi
DSan Francisco in her Washington DC office

For a time Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White
Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes  From police sources he
obtained privileged personal information on at least  people
And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government
to trade his knowledge for crisp new  bills

These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz a former
Los Angelesbased operative divulged in extensive interviews with
police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nationwide
intelligence network operated by the AntiDefamation League

Officials of the AntiDefamation League while denying any improper
activity have said they will cooperate with the investigation  They
have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz

Transcripts of the interviews  among nearly  pages of documents
released by San Francisco prosecutors last week  offer new details
of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line
into illegal territory

At times the intelligence activities took on a cloakanddagger air
with laundered payments shredded documents hotel rendezvous with
foreign agents and code names like Ironsides and Flipper

On one occasion Gurvitz recounts he received a tip that a
proPalestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa
Israel  Although the AntiDefamation League publicly denies any ties
to Israel Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him
Shortly afterward another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed
him

The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard a former CIA
agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing
confidential material from police files to the AntiDefamation League

Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by
the FBI but left behind a briefcase in his police locker  Its
contents included passports driver's licenses and identification
cards in  different names identification cards in his own name for
four American embassies in Central America and a collection of blank
birth certificates Army discharge papers and official stationery from
various agencies

Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads a
black hood apparently for use in interrogations and photos of
blindfolded and chained men

Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the
ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information
on a vast number of people including as many as  members of one
target group the ArabAmerican AntiDiscrimination Committee

Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would
constitute a felony San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in
an affidavit for a search warrant

The AntiDefamation League a selfdescribed Jewish defense and civil
rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on
groups that are antiSemitic extremist or racist The ADL's
factfinding division headed by Irwinn Suall in New York enjoys a
reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with
police agencies and journalists

However evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files
on at least  groups of all political stripes including the
American Civil Liberties Union Earth Island Institute the United
Farm Workers Jews for Jesus Mother Jones magazine the Center for
Investigative Reporting the Bo Gritz for President Committee the
Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP

The computer files also included information on several members of
Congress including Pelosi House Armed Services Committee Chairman
Ron Dellums DBerkeley and former Republican Rep Pete McCloskey
from the Bay Area

In their statements Bullock and Gurvitz said the AntiDefamation
League has collected information on political activists in the Los
Angeles area for more than  years  They said they worked closely
with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in
intelligence work a Los Angeles Police Department antiterrorism
expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence
officer

A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew
nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL  The Los
Angeles Police Department which earlier refused to cooperate with the
investigation and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined
comment

Bullock  is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy
drama  Although he is not Jewish he began working undercover as a
volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in  after reading a
book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party

Bullock moved to Los Angeles in  and was given a paid position by
the ADL as an intelligence operative he told authorities  In the
mids he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations
up and down the West Coast

To keep his identity secret his salary has always been funneled
through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I Hochman  who has never
missed a payment in more than  years Bullock said

I was an investigator for the ADL  I investigated any and all
antidemocratic movements Bullock said     Officially I'm only
a contract worker with Bruce Hochman  That way the league would not
be officially connected with me

Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists
to ArabAmerican to gay radicals to skinheads usually using his own
name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink

I'm one of a kind he told police

In recent years however his ADL affiliation has increasingly become
known and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a
shotgun who threatened to kill him

In the mids he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a
synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and
matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by
police  In part because of this investigation he became close
friends with Gerard who at the time was working in the San Francisco
police intelligence division

Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups  An
FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group

Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash and
would share the reports with Gerard  Bullock also gave the trash to
Gerard for Gerard to examine  Gerard would later return the trash to
Bullock

From a wide range of sources Bullock compiled files on 
individuals and more than  political groups  Gerard whose files
contained many identical entries kept files on  people

In  Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of
information to the South African government  Bullock tells of
meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels
and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new 
bills

Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled
only from public sources Once he rewrote an innocuous item published
by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli 
and submitted it as his own work

Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence
Bullock said he split about  from the South African government
evenly with Gerard telling him at one point I may be gay but I'm a
straight arrow

In his interviews with the police and FBI Bullock talked freely about
engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to
violate the law

For example Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records
and criminal histories from Gerard on about  people  a fraction of
the confidential police data found in his computer  And he said
Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence
files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under
department policy

Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation
of Islam that he later shredded at the AntiDefamation League's San
Francisco office

Bullock seemed proud of his Operation Eavesdrop in which he used a
paid informant codenamed Scumbag to help tap into a White Aryan
Resistance phone message network listening to the messages left by
members of the rightwing group  For a short time it was
wonderful he told police

In Los Angeles ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago
as a factfinder to keep intelligence files and occasionally go
undercover to the meetings of target groups

Among other things he told San Francisco authorities the Los Angeles
ADL office kept a record of any ArabAmerican who had antiIsrael
leanings or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such
sentiment

Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he
attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a
rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for
Holocaust Studies  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival
and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a rightwing hate
group

Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the
probe providing considerable information about the ADL operation
Unlike Bullock he has been assured he is not a subject of the
investigation

Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed
by The Times Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment

PS My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics It has to do with
the search for peace which would enable justice I don't consider that
justice is done when nonJews who fled or were expelled in 
are not permitted to return to their homeland

How about Jews who were expelled from their homelands in Iraq Syria
Jordan Algeria etc  Don't they deserve justice too

This can at best be called
pragmatism a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong It can
never be called justice

Why is your criticism ALWAYS directed against Israel but never
against the Arab states even when they are so much more guilty of the
accusations you make  Is it because you now call yourself a
Palestinean

And peace without justice will never be peace

This is why the landforpeace formula is so foolish  Landforland
or peaceforpeace seems much more just except that it would cost the
Arabs something and so is not under consideration

Let's not forget that about half of Israel's population are refugees
from Arab countries  Somehow THEIR land now being occupied by Arab
states and THEIR homes now being livedin by Arab people are not
included in any negotiations  Is this your prescription for peace

It is my conviction that the situation in which a state through the
law attempts to discourage mixed marriages as Israel does is not
normal Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than
Western democracies such as the United States in which Jews are free to
marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands

Again you've somehow managed to overlook the fact that the Arab
states are much more restrictive on these points  In fact the
officially Judenrein policies of almost all of the Arab states makes
them resemble Nazi Germany chillingly closely

American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed
Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW

There are many states in which Christians can live happily many which
have official religions and Christian majorities and Christianbased
laws  There are some  dozen Arab and Islamic states  There is only
 one Jewish state  Do you have a problem with this  Is this one
Jewish state too many  There are others who might agree with you you
know

I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views
and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional infantile
outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect
Judaism are uncivilized Such behaviour is not good for Judaism

Have you just arrived on tpm recently  Again the supporters of the
Arab and Islamic camps are frequently and massively guilty of
emotional infantile outbursts which have weakened their positions
dramatically  Somehow your criticisms are very onesided and
simpleminded

PS How's the Fund coming along

acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships US
warships have I believe become unwelcome in New Zealand which has
declared itself a nuclearfreezone

The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years
there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to
long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the
crimes of which they were accused ever being made public More
precisely A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of
their arrest and later on their imprisonment

The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs either

In Israel of  citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of
this country knowing anything about it  Not knowing anything about
the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison
for security offenses in complete secrecy

This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence  It would've
been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name
of someone who is sitting in jail lost to the world as he suggests
Maybe Elvis or JFK somebody

Let's put it this way If Israel has put people away without
publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them how
has their disappearance been explained  People have relatives
friends and colleagues you know  Israel is not known as a place
where people are made to vanish  Would you care to give us a list of
people whose whereabouts are unknown  People who are presumed to be
imprisoned  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've
come to associate with Yigal Arens before  Perhaps from now on we
should

On the th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians
we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an
emerging Turkish protofascist state In their names we demand justice

In April  the Turkish government began a systematically executed
depopulation of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a
genocidal extermination This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey The
result  million murdered  billion dollars of Armenian property stolen
and plundered This genocide ended nearly  years of Armenian civilization
on those lands Today the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands Today's Turkish
governmental policy is to rewrite the history of the era to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people In
the face of refutation ad nauseam the Turkish Historical Society and cronies
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred This policy
merely demonstrates that in the modern era genocide is an effective state
policy when it remains unredressed and unpunished A crime unpunished is a
crime encouraged Adolf Hitler took this cue less than  years after the
successful genocide of the Armenians

Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased What
I disagree with is your statement that the US Media is out to
ruin Israels reputation That is rediculous The US media is
the most proisraeli media in the world Having lived in Europe
I realize that incidences such as the one described in the
letter have occured The US media as a whole seem to try to
ignore them The US is subsidizing Israels existance and the
Europeans are not at least not to the same degree So I think
that might be a reason they report more clearly on the
atrocities
	What is a shame is that in Austria daily reports of
the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing
received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt
go away After all look how the Jews are treating other races
when they got power It is unfortunate

       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS
    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities aired on Tuesday
    April  For the sake of brevity I'll present them in some separate
    points

     As many other western programs this program was laid on a bed of
    misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the
    program on the viewer Some of the misinformations were as follows

     It was alleged that Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological
    advancements as antiIslamic but now things have changed and the proof of
    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers 
    These are the most ridiculous lies one can make about the objectives
    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology
    in Iran after revolution

    Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors
    while there has never been any proof in this regard and nobody has seen
    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons in
    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and
    civilians injured by Iraqi chemical weapons

     While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi
    aggression has been officially announced to be about  and even most
    radical counterrevolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total
    of one million dead this program claims that Iran alone has one million
    dead left from the war

     The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not  true For
    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that  It hurts me to
    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda The
    translator says  It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly
    research

     Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought
    by Iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to
    undermine their nonmilitary uses without any reference to Iran's
    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in
    near future and its current deficit in electrical power

     The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of
    Technology as a nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the
    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed
    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university Taking in account
    the scientific advancement of Sharif U in engineering fields and its
    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the
    lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries
    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones
    in scientific and industrial efforts

     A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA  in their numerous visits from
    Iran's different sites They say We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not  or  We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons

     As an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the
    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs
    William Triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking
    from the absolute knowledge

       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their
    country in western media and I hope Iranian authorities continue to
    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs
    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations

I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that
totally destroys Begin's whitewash  I have no particular desire
to post it yet again

Brendan
normally bdmcsanueduau

You apparently think you are some sort of oneman judge and jury who

So what are you

can declare total victory and then sit back and enjoy the
applause  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few
rigged quotations can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir
Yassin massacre

I don't think that you are just making noise

You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology

That's true  I try to learn from people who know more than me
not from useless farts

At the most basic level you should know that there is a big
difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding
quotations that support your preset opinions

Of course I have said that more times in this group than
anyone else I'd think

If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that
many of the sources of your quotations have an axe to grind and
therefore you must be very careful about whom you quote  For

Quite true that's why I am so careful in selecting quotes

example Meir Pa'il whom you cite was indeed a general a scholar
and a war hero  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of
his mouth is gold  In fact and here your lack of experience
shows Pa'il is such a fanatic embittered leftist that much of his

Oh bullshit  Fanatic my bum  Prove your blah or cork it

antiIsrael blathering forget about antiIrgun blathering would be
considered something like treason in nonIsrael contexts  But of
course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy
quotation that you can use to attack Israel

How would you know what I consider  Read my mind

Benny Morris of Hashomer Hatzair represents himself as a scholar
when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun  Don't be fooled
It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight surfacing as an
attack on the then Likud government  If you will look closely at
the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence
you will see his indictment to be pure hot air  And this is the
BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning
evidence  Unfortunately for him because his book parades itself as
scholarly he is forced to put footnotes  So you can clearly see
that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing

I looked very closely at a large number of sources  You have no
idea what you are talking about

The Deir Yassin massacre never took place as the propagandists
tell it any more than the Sabra and Shatila massacres Do you get

That's true about the accounts of both Irgun and Arab propagandists
Like Begin for example

the feeling people like to blame the Jews for massacres even if

No I never got that feeling  I got rather opposite feelings
about people like you though

they have to make them up  It must sound spicy  Even some Jews
like to do it for reasons of their own

Honesty  Perhaps you would explain the testimony from members
of the Irgun to be found in their own handwriting in the
Irgun Archives in Tel Aviv that the wounded Arabs were killed
that a group of  prisoners was massacred that Lehi proposed
exterminating everybody at the preraid meeting  Exactly what
reasons can you propose that this testimony should be rejected
in favour of Begin's

Please don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin massacre stuff
with facts or scholarship  You should stick to Begin's version
unless you find something serious to contradict it

This is very funny  You carried on about unsupported evidence
propagandists axes to grind and you end up telling us to stick
to the account of the leader of the alleged killers  You are
obviously a hopeless case as everyone can plainly see

Subject Final Solution for Gaza 

While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto

fete Since this word both formally and commonly refers to
positivejoyous events your misuse of it here is rather unsettling

they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto
and attempt to starve the Gazans

I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are
abusive towards the PalestiniansGazans Given that however there
is no comparison between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in
Gaza

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying
entity to maintain order especially in the face of elements
that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure
Ironically international law recognizes each of these focusses
that of the occupied and the occupier even though they are
inherently in conflict

As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible
with basic human rights and international law that of becoming
Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
selfdetermination it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish
society does not consider Gazans full human beings

Israel certainly cannot and should not continue its present
policies towards Gazan residents There is however a third
alternative the creation and implementation of a jewish dhimmi
system with GazansPalestinians as benignly protected citizens
Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with
regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities

Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve 

It is a race then Between Israel's antiPalestinianGazan
Final Solution and the Arab World's antiIsraeljewish
Final Solution Do you favor one neither

I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
they can to help the Gazans regain their full human civil and
political rights to which they are entitled as human beings

Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel
and ArabPalestinian final solution intentions exist isn't it
important that BOTH Israeli and PalestinianGazan rights
be secured

    Sam Zbib Writes
   No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity
   Palestinians are no exception Perhaps you heard about
   antitrust in the business world
   
   Since we are debating the legality of a commercial
   transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines
   and ethics of such transactions Basic ANTITRUST law says
   that while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of
   investing you can not acquire a large number of those
   shares with the intent or controlling IBM You can do so
   only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori  Clearly
   the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some
   designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate
   They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews
   
   The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the
   old tradition of arab hospitality Being a multiethnic 
   multireligious society accepting the jews as neighbours
   was no different just another religion Plus they paid fair
   market value etc They did not know they were victims of
   an international conspiracy I'm not a conspiracy theorist
   myself but this one is hard to dismiss
   

Right now I'm just going to address this point
When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land
It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves because
for the most part they were tenant farmers fallahin
living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon
The JNF offered a premium deal so the owners took advantage of
it   It's called commerce  The owners however made no
provisions for those who had worked for them basically shafting
them by selling the land right out from under them
They are to blame not the Jews



Amir
Why would you categorize the sale of land as shafting was
it because it was sold to Jews was it fair to assume that the
fallahin would be mistreated by the jews is this the norm of
any commerce read shafting between arabs and  jews

It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it
without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible
enough to make provisions for them but rather just leaving
them to their fate

Your claim that the LebaneseSyrian Landlords sold Palestine
if true even partially omits the fact that the mandate
treaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule while
Palestine under british  Obiviously any such landlord
would have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would
be motivated to sell regardless of the price

The point is that the land was sold legally often at prices
above its actual value  It was legal and good business for
the sellers though it left the Palestinians who worked the land
in a poor situation

It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the
palestinians were shafted Do many Israelis or Jews share
your opinion   Do you  absolve the purchaser from
any ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down

I don't know if others share this opinion  It is mine
and I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't
The way I see it the fallahin were caught in circumstances
beyond their control in that since they didn't own the land
they didn't have a say Of course now for the sake of the greater
Arab unity the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews
an act that is illegal in Jordan but when it happened it was just
business

All told I did not see an answer in your response The
question was whether the intent behind the purchase was
aimed at controlling the public assets land
infrastructure etc IMHO the Palestinians have grounds
to contest the legality of the purchase say in world court

Sam

       My opinions are my own and no one else's

The purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for
Jewish immigrants  In any case no matter what the purpose
the sales were legal so I really don't see any grounds for
contesting them

 The problem if  transffering US government files about Yigal Arens
 and some other similar persons does or does not violate a federal
 or a local American law seemed to belong to some local american law
 forum  not to this forum
 The readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents
 of those files
 So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us
  Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous

I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous  In any
case that has nothing to do with the current case  The claim against
the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that
was gathered by state andor federal agencies in the course of their
standard interaction with citizens such as myself  By that I refer to
things such as address and phone number vehicle registration and
license information photographs etc

  Why does the ADL have an interest in that person 

You should ask the ADL if you want an authoritative answer  My guess
is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in
political criticism of Israel  I further believe that they did this as
agents of the Israeli government or at least in agreement with them
At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to
Israeli officials  In some cases it was used to influence or attempt
to influence people's access to jobs or public forums  These matters
will be brought out as the court case unfolds since California law
entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven  As my
previous posting shows California law entitles people to compensation
even in the absence of any specific consequences  just for the further
dissemination of certain types of private information about them

        Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of
  individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
  identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
  state secrets 


 Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors there
 was one other espionage case the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona
 Biological Institute who was a KGB mole who was tried in camera
 I wouldn't exactly call it a state secret The trial was simply tried
 behind closed doors I hate to disappoint you but the United States
 has tried a number of espionage cases in camera

At issue was not a trial behind closed doors but arrest trial and
imprisonment in complete secrecy  This was appraently attempted in the
case of Vanunu and failed  It has happened before and there is reason
to believe it still goes on

PUBLICATION BAN

        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many
        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were
        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of
        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever
        being made public

By Baruch Me'iri

All those involved in this matter politely refused my request one way
or another Look the subject is too delicate  If I comment on it I
will be implicitly admitting that it is true If I mention a specific
case even hint at it I might be guilty of making public something
which may legally not be published

The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years
there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to
long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the
crimes of which they were accused ever being made public More
precisely A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of
their arrest and later on their imprisonment

In Israel of  citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of
this country knowing anything about it  Not knowing anything about
the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison
for security offenses in complete secrecy

In the distant past  for example during the days of the Lavon  YA
affair  we heard about the third man being in prison  But many
years have passed since then and what existed then can today no
longer be found even in South American countries or in the former
Communist countries

But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 

The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law the Constitution and
Justice MK David Zucker sent a letter on this subject early this
week to the Prime Minister the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet
Legal Advisor  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter

During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been
imprisoned for various periods for security offenses  In some of
these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the
specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted but
even on the mere fact of their imprisonment  In those cases after
being legally convicted the prisoners spend their term in prison
without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the
prisoner asserts MK Zucker

On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that There is
absolutely no question that it is possible and in some cases it is
imperative that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of
security offenses and the course of trials  But even in such cases
the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances
under which a trial will not be held in public

However one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on
the mere fact of a person's arrest and on the name of a person
sentenced to prison is justified and appropriate in the State of
Israel  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to
know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public
sight and his descent into the abyss of prison

Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister the Minister of
Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider
the question  The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the
cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment  The
State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention
and its cause is kept secret wrote Zucker

The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union Attorney Mordechai
Shiffman said that We as the Civil Rights Union do not know of any
cases of security prisoners Citizens of Israel who are imprisoned
and whose imprisonment cannot be made public  This is a situation
which if it actually exists is definitely unhealthy  Just like
censorship is an unhealthy matter

The Union is aware says Shiffman of cases where notification of a
suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld  I am
speaking only of several days  I know also of cases where a detainee
was not allowed to meet with an attorney  sometimes for the whole
first month of arrest  That is done because of the great secrecy

The suspect himself his family his lawyer  or even a journalist 
can challenge the publication ban in court  But there are cases where
the family members themselves are not interested in publicity  The
journalist knows nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone is
happy

Attorney Yossi Arnon an official of the Bar claims that given the
laws as they exist in Israel today a situation where the arrest of a
person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible
Nothing is easier  The court orders a publication ban and that's
that  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long
years in prison without us knowing anything about it

 Do you find this situation acceptable

Attorney Arnon Definitely not  We live in a democratic country and
such a state of affairs is impermissible  I am well aware that
publication can be damaging  from the standpoint of security  but
total nonpublication silence is unacceptable Consider the trial of
Mordechai Vanunu at least in his case we know that he was charged
with aggravated espionage and sentenced to  years in prison  The
trial was held behind closed doors nobody knew the details except for
those who were authorized to  It is somehow possible to understand
though not to accept the reasons but as I have noted we at least
are aware of his imprisonment

 Why is the matter actually that serious  Can't we trust the
discretion of the court

Attorney Arnon The judges have no choice but to trust the
presentations made to them The judges do not have the tools to
investigate  This gives the government enormous power power which
they can misuse

 And what if there really is a security issue

Attorney Arnon I am a man of the legal system not a security expert
 Democracy stands in opposition to security  I believe it is possible
to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges  without
entering into detail  We have already seen how the laws concerning
publication bans can be misused in the case of the Rachel Heller
murder  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the
matter being made public

Attorney Shiffman on the other hand believes that state security can
be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's
arrest or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment  A healthy
situation  Definitely not  But I am aware of the fact that mere
publication may be harmful to state security

A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal former
advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda
Meir  Clearly we are speaking of isolated special cases  Such
situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must
be held in public No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom
of expression  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom
which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication

Nevertheless adds Shtendal the legislator allowed for the
possibility of such a ban to accommodate special cases where the
damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that
which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned
The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with
the Prime Minister or the security services but with the court which
we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has
been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt

Nevertheless attorney Shtendal agrees As a rule clearly such a
phenomenon is undesirable Such an extreme step must be taken only in
the most extreme circumstances

      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'

'both sides' of the divide would make the conflict lose its

   I'm surprised that you don't consider the acquisition of land by
   the Jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive
   state as a hostile action leading to war

	It was for the purpose of establishing a state not an
 exclusive state  If the state was to be exclusive it would not have
   arab citizens

Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of
Israel right after it was formed


 	And no I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile
 action  When someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing
 to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce  It
 is not a hostile action leading to war

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity
Palestinians are no exception Perhaps you heard about
antitrust in the business world

Since we are debating the legality of a commercial
transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines
and ethics of such transactions Basic ANTITRUST law says
that while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of
investing you can not acquire a large number of those
shares with the intent or controlling IBM You can do so
only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori  Clearly
the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some
designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate
They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews

The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the
old tradition of arab hospitality Being a multiethnic 
multireligious society accepting the jews as neighbours
was no different just another religion Plus they paid fair
market value etc They did not know they were victims of
an international conspiracy I'm not a conspiracy theorist
myself but this one is hard to dismiss


As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace maybe
However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish
state where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of
the land  Living in peace is meaningless unless it means
living WITH someone else as equal For a native arab this
does not leave many options

	Oh you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens  The
arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who
they vote for as the Jews

Again Adam the devil is in the details I don't want to get
on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its
OK to return  deportes and leave the rest Because  is
a nice number that you can devide by   and besides it
has an integer square root

Those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what
happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless
and ineffective minority
If I were wrong you'd have Israel recall all the
palestinian refugees we're talking millions After all
they are civilians

	Huh  The people who left did so voluntarily  There is no
reason for Israel to let them in

Do you actually believe this My experience tells me that
every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home in
Palestine Besides they often refer to their exodus as an
escape from hell so to speak I know none that agrees with
you Did you sample their opinions I know you don't care
just being rethorical


Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it
had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid
flowing

	Israel got no western aid in  nor in  or It
still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained  And how
is granting citizenship a facade

Don't get me wrong I beleive that Israel is democratic
within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group Jews
Israel probably had a few options after  ethnic
cleansing Serbian style and deserve the wrath of the
international community or make the best out of a no win
condition show the world how good Israel is towards the
'bad' arabs Personaly I've never heard anything about the
arab community in Isreal Except that they're there  So
yes they're there But as a community with history and
roots its dead

	Tell me something Sam  What makes land arab

How shall I explain Its a contract between the man and the
land  Control isn't it The Ottomans ruled  years and
then left with barely a trace  The concept of Land identity
is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic West  It is
partly the concept of 'le sol natal' native soil  I know
that jews had previous history in the region but none in
recent memory  I'm talking everyday life not archeology

	Try again you tell me what its isn't but you fail to
 establish what it is

	Also Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand
years  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel
There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 
Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from  or so onwards  Does that
make the land Jewish


I stand corrected I meant that the jewish culture was not
predominant in Palestine in recent history I have no
problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were
predominantly Jewish So there what to make of the rest
Palestine

 Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover
 Israel should totally back down Sothe easiest way to get away with
 attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the
 other respects innocent lives

 Tell me Tim what are these guerillas doing wrong Assuming that they are
 using civilians for cover

Assuming Also come on Brad If we are going to get anywhere in
this or any discussion it doesn't help to bring up elements I never
addressed nor commented on in any way I made no comment on who is
right or who is wrong only that civilians ARE being used as cover
and that having been placed in between the Israelis and the guerillas
they will be injured as both parties continue their fight

	The purpose of an army's use of military uniforms
	is to set its members apart from the civilians so that
	civilians will not be thought of by the other side as
	combatants So what do you think is the meaning behind
	the intention and the effect when an army purposely
	does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to look
	like civilians' They are judging that the benefit they will
	receive from this cover is more important that the harm
	that will come to civilians

This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying
that the guerillas do have some responsibility in putting civilians
in the middle of this fight By putting on uniforms and living apart
from civilians barracks etc the guerillas would significantly lower
the risk to civilians

	But if the guerillas do this aren't they putting themselves
	at greater risk Absolutely they ask themselves why set
	ourselves apart by wearing uniforms when there is a readymade
	cover for us civilians That makes sense from their point of
	view BUT when this cover is used the guerillas should accept
	some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians

 If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel is it not working Why
 is it further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages Why
 not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone You see there
 is more to the shelling of the villages it is called RETALIATION
 GETTING BACKGETTING EVEN It doesn't make sense to shell the
 villages The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli
 government for the lives of civilians

I agree with you here I have always thought that Israel's bombing
sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane AND
ineffective BUT there is no reason that Israel should passive wait
until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that
taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks

As I said previously Israel spent several decades sitting passively
on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after
the attackers had entered Israeli territory It didn't work very well
The host Arab state did littlenothing to try and stop these attacks
from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks
were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact
on the civilians caught in their path

 WhatSo the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states
 can start all over again While I also hope for this to happen it will
 only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are prepared to take on the
 responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their
 soil They have to Prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way
 Israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of
 tolerance towards antiIsrael guerillas inresidence

 If Israel is not willing to accept the word of others then IMHO it has
 no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks

This is just another selectively applied statement

The reason for this drawnout impasse between AbabsPalestinians and Israelis
is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other By your
criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations

That is precisely why the Palestinians in their recent PISGA proposal for
the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are
demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already They DO
NOT trust that Israel will follow through the entire process and allow
Palestinians to reach full autonomy

Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians
If you do then why should Israel's view of ArabsPalestinians
be any different Why should they trust the ArabPalestinians' words
Since they don't they are VERY reluctant to give up tangible assets
land control of areas in exchange for words For this reason
they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have
that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached

But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways
If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word
of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the
Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy

Absolutely so are the ArabsPalestinians asking FIRST for the
Israelis word in relation to any agreement NO what is being
demanded FIRST is LAND When the issue is LAND and one party
finally gets HOLD of this land what the other party does
is totally irrelevent If I NOW have possession of this land
your words have absolutely no power whether Israel chooses to
keeps its word does NOT get the land back

Afterall Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from
areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG

 Tim you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been
 disarmed Hezbollah remains the only independent militia Hezbollah does
 not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up
 Sheikh Mosavi his wife and young son

While the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars
have been removed the weapons needed to crossborder attacks still
remain to some extent Rocket attacks still continue and commando
raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard
for human life yours of that of others Such attacks also continue

 Of course if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon
 and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't
 make the Lebanese so mad as to do that

Bat guano The situation you call for existed in the s and attacks
were commonplace

Furthermore with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible

There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively disarmed UNLESS the state
is as authoritarian is Syria's The only other way is for Lebanon to take
it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel essentially
mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that
it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory

 Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain
 control If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel

 Tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border
 Not lately eh

That's what I said ok But doesn't that mean that Syria has to take over
Lebanon I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that

What both sides need is to receive something tangible The Arabs
Palestinians are looking for land and demanding that they receive it
prior to giving anything to Israel Israel has two problems  if it
gives up real land it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic
situation and that change doesn't help Israel's position and  WHEN
it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to
compensate for the increased risks

 Your view of this entire matter is far too serenely onesided and
 selectively naive

Oooh now THAT hurts  I will not suffer you through more naive

Oh Wise Tim and have a good day

What is the point in throwing out onesided viewpoints which means
ignoring that the other side's perspective and experience HAS ANY
LEGITIMACY while assuming that your side possesses no faults and
bears no responbility for ANY of the negative impacts of a particular
event Isn't the former onesided Isn't the latter naive If you feel

under the cover of a snide remark seems to be the favored tactic on this

                     THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH

     Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training
videotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions the military
arm of Hamas an Islamic Palestinian group Hamas figures
significantly in the Middle East equation In December Israel
deported more than  Palestinians to Lebanon in response to
Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier A longer
version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine which
obtained and translated the tape

     My name is Yasir Hammad alHassan Ali I live in Nuseirat a
refugee camp in the Gaza Strip I was born in  I finished
high school then attended Gaza Polytechnic Later I went to work
for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk I'm married and I have
two daughters
     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine
explicitly dedicated to jihad holy war Our primary concern is
Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy Many young men and
women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the Israeli
Security Services
     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation
cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime Our most
important objective must be to put an end to the plague of
collaboration To do so we abduct collaborators intimidate and
interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose
the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into
collaboration in the first place In addition to that naturally
we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them
     We don't execute every collaborator After all about 
percent of them are innocent victims tricked or blackmailed into
their misdeeds The decision whether to execute a collaborator is
based on the seriousness of his crimes If like many
collaborators he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli
Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once
He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier so we treat him like an
Israeli soldier
     There's another group of collaborators who perform an even
more loathsome role  the ones who help the enemy trap young men
and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become
collaborators I regard the isqat the process by which a
Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration of single person as
greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator If someone is
guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat than it is our religious
duty to execute him
     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the
distribution of narcotics They work on direct orders from the
Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible Their
victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and
impossible to afford more They collaborate in order to get the
drugs they crave The dealers must also be executed
     In the battalions we have developed a very careful method of
uncovering collaborators We can't afford to abduct an innocent
person because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished
forever We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after
evidence of his guilt has been established  never before If
after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any
doubt then he is executed
     In many cases we don't have to make our evidence against
collaborators public because everyone knows that they're guilty
But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a
collaborator and we accuse him people are bound to ask for
evidence Many people will proclaim his innocence so there must be
irrefutable proof before he is executed This proof is usually
obtained in the form of a confession
     At first every collaborator denies his crimes So we start
off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him We tell
him that he still has a chance to serve his people even in the
last moment of his life by confessing and giving us the
information we need
     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has
been a victim That kind of talk is convincing Most of them
confess after that Others hold out in those cases we apply
pressure both psychological and physical Then the holdouts
confess as well
     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an
interrogation In that case the collaborator had been seen working
for the Border Guard since before the intifada and he himself
confessed his involvement to a friend who disclosed the
information to us In addition three members of his network of
collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat With this
much evidence there was no need to interrogate him But we are
very careful to avoid wrongful executions In every case our
principal is the same the accused should be interrogated until he
himself confesses his crimes
     A few weeks ago we sat down and complied a list of
collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be
executed without interrogation An although we had hundreds of
names still because of our fear of God and of hell we could not
mark any of these men except for the one I just mentioned for
execution
     When we execute a collaborator in public we use a gun But
after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator we can't shoot him
 to do so might give away our locations That's why collaborators
are strangled Sometimes we ask the collaborator What do you
think How should we execute you One collaborator told us
Strangle me He hated the sight of blood

Subject Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan
Cherry units which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate
within the occupied territories

Excerpts from the article

A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as
Arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods But the most
important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with It is
that everyone who serves in the Cherry after a time goes in one
way or another insane

A man who said this who will here be called Danny his full name
is known to the editors served in the Cherry After his discharge
from the army he works as delivery boy His pal who will here be
called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry and is now about to
depart for a roundtheworld tour They both look no different
from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript
service But in their souls one can notice something completely
differentIt was not easy for them to come out with disclosures
about what happened to them And they think that to most of their
fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either Yet after they
began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking
The following article will contain all the horror stories
recounted with an appalling openness

 A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team in
which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry We
called such soldiers HI 'Hit by the Intifada' Under my command
was a soldier who talked to himself nonstop which is a common
phenomenon in the Cherry I sent him to a psychiatrist But why I
should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane  On
Fridays when I come home my parents know I cannot be talked to
until I go to the beach surf a little calm down and return The
keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance so that I
can go there I they dare talk to me before or whenever I don't
want them to talk to me I just grab a chair and smash it
instantly I know it is my nerve  Smashing chairs all the time
and then running away from home to the car and to the beach Only
there I become normal

 Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother
It was an omelette of sorts She took the risk of sitting next to
me and talking to me I then told my mother about an event which
was still fresh in my mind I told her how I shot an Arab and how
exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it She began
to laugh hysterically I wanted her to cry and she dared laugh
straight in my face instead  So I told her how my pal had made a
mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov
cocktails He shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as
they deserved One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire with
the effect that the Arab was burning all over just beautifully I
was delighted to see it  My pal fired three bullets two at the
Arab with the Molotov cocktail and the third at his chum It hit
him straight in his ass We both felt that we'd pulled off
something

Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts
in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that
spot to take a look I reached the spot first And then that Arab
blood gushing forth from his body spits at me I yelled 'Shut
up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew So I just laughed
straight in his face I am usually laughing when I stare at
something convulsing right before my eyes Then I told him 'All
right wait a moment' I left him in order to take a look at
another wounded Arab I asked a soldier if that Arab could be
saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the
help of a stone of something else like that I keep telling all
this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight
into my face This infuriated me I got very angry because I felt
I was becoming mad So I stopped eating seized the plate with he
omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over
her head Only then she stopped laughing At first she didn't know
what to say

 But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls
upon us frequently I went with a friend to practice shooting on a
field A gull appeared right in the middle of the field My friend
shot it at once Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the
hill above us My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it
We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock We shot down two
deer more and went to take a look When we climbed the rocks we
saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to
such some milk from its already dead mother We carefully
inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of
the two deer we had hit We were just delighted by that sight We
had hit'em so good  Then we decided to kill the young deer too
so as spare it further suffering I approached took out my
revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short
distance When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the
bullets sinking in  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall
outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of
blood straight on us This made us feel cured of the spurt of our
madness Standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like
beasts of prey We couldn't explain what had happened to us We
were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we
felt the whole day very badly

 We always go back to places we carried out assignments in
This is why we can see them When you see a guy you disabled may
be for the rest of his life you feel you got power You feel
Godlike of sorts

 Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment
studying the acting Dudu is not willing to work in any
securitylinked occupation Danny feels the exact opposite 'Why
shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well 
Why shouldn't I earn  for each chopped head I would deliver
while being a mercenary in South Africa  This kind of job suits
me perfectly I have no human emotions any more If I get a
reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to
Bosnia in order to fight there

Title In the neighborhood of Hope among the rubble

Excerpts

Mahmoud Jowara'r stared at me long and sadly I worked my entire
life in order to built that house and this is what is left Only
TV could transmit the full sadness of his face You say that we
teach our children to hate you but what do you expect to happen
to a child who sees this  And once again he wraps himself in a
lengthy silence his face crumbling into weeping Mahmoud stood in
the field of rubble that was once his home The term
'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here Nothing is left of
what he accumulated during his entire life only the rubble of a
house and shreds of belongings

Once again Khan Yunis Once again demolished homes Last Thursday
there was a search for wanted people here Once again the IDF
forces employed the new method fired and bombed and shot missiles
and placed explosives Already three times during the past weeks I
have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more
horrifying scenes This time they hit the largest number of
houses  according to the IDF estimate ten of them completely
demolished But not only that  the method has also become more
brutal Three weeks ago in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza the
residents were still told to remove their valuables from their
homes  This time the army skipped that part three weeks ago the
handcuffed men inhabitants of the demolished homes were supplied
with some water and one apple during the  hours they had to
stand This time there was only water Three weeks ago they were
even allowed to go out to the toilet This time the soldier just
gold them Piss and shit in your pants And thus last Thursday
some  men stood for about  hours their hands bound behind
their backs their eyes blindfolded without food with wet pants
on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their
hearts listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their
homes one after the other



Dr Juma'a Fuad Said alRubi the brother from Saudi Arabia
emerges from among the ruins Ten days ago he arrived for a family
visit mainly in order to celebrate the housewarming with his
father and brothers On Thursday he was handcuffed like everyone
else for  hours and later went with everyone to view the
destrucion He tried to explain that he was a visitor and that he
is a physician but only got a shove  Like all the rest he also
urinated in his pants while standing with his hands bound and his
eyes blindfolded for the entire day Juma'a alRubi studied
medicine at Cairo University and for ten years he has been
treating wealthy Saudis in Medina His wife and four children
remained there Now his documents have been lost and he does not
know how he will return to them There is no humanity stated
the physician from Saudi Arabia

Subject Torture

Title of article Moderate physical pressure

Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation
room in Tulkarm prison during which he says he was humiliated
beaten and tortured Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator a
Shabak agent 'Captain Louis' chatting on the phone with his wife
At those moments Omar said I felt that he was like a
humanbeing but right after he finished talking he would be beat
me and say 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed
yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being

In late October  after  days in detention at Tulkarm
prison Omar Jaber was released without charges Among the Jews
as among the Arabs there are good people and bad people he said
after his release but there in Tulkarm in the interrogations
rooms you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that
he is a human being Although he left the detention installation
in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated I sat at home for ten days My
hands shook from nerves one may consider Omar Jaber lucky He
got out not so healthy but entire and even ultimately returned
to normal functioning at the small solar heater plant he owns

In contrast Hassan Bader alZbeidi for example was released
seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after  days in the
Shabak wing cut off from his surroundings He doesn't speak or
react Mustafa Barakat aged only  who was arrested in early
August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation left
it one day later  dead We have recently received an especially
large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at
the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators noted
Dr Niv Gordon director of the Association of Israel and
Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights 

The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan
Saber Makhlouf a  year old student In fact he was extremely
fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated
in Tulkarm prison in case the publication in the paper would
return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment

follow description of tortures

Omar a tall bearded man was silent I do not want to talk about
it he finally said quietly Some time later embarrased and
ashamed he spoke Sometimes he beats you and beats you until
you'll kiss his hand and not only his hand Even the hands of
another interrogator and another whom he calls into the room
and the last interrogator says Now you are kissing my hand and
later if I want you will kiss my ass

These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation
located within the military government compound in Tulkarm West
Bank But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom In
early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem the
Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories to
visit Tulkarm prison but denied them access to the interrogation
wing The interrogation wing is Shabak property being solely
under Shabak responsibility All interrogations are performed by
it said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an the commander of the
installation according to the internal report written by B'tselem
member Yuval Ginbar following the visit Major David Pe'er
governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command
was quoted in the report  There is an ethical problem here  no
one can enter the interrogation wing

I don't know anything about this particular case but other
governments have been known to follow events on the Usenet  For
example after Tienanmien Square in Beijing the Chinese government
began monitoring cyberspace  As the former Director of PeaceNet
I am aware of many incidents of local state national and
international authorities monitoring Usenet and other conferences
such as those on the Institute for Global Communications  But
what's the big deal  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this
medium in any case  If you are concerned about being monitored
you should use encyrption software available in IGC's micro
conference  I know for a fact that human rights activists in the
BalkanMideast area use encryption software to send out their
reports to international organizations  Such message can be
decoded however by large computers consuming much CPU time which
probably the Turkish government doesn't have access to

FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS

Hadashot  March 

The Israeli Police Department announced on the evening of Friday
March  that it is calling upon Jewish Israeli citizens with
gun permits to carry them at all times so as to contribute to
their security and that of their surroundings

Ha'aretz  March 

Yehoshua Matza Likud Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee
stated that he intends to demand that the police department make
it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills
nonJewish terrorists will not be put on trial

Ha'aretz  March

Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern
Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza
strip as an additional stage in the upgrading of security
measures in the Strip

The gates will aid in the searching of nonJewish Gaza residents
as they leave for work in Israel They can be used to reveal the
presence of knives axes weapons and other sharp objects

In addition to the gates which will be operated by a private
civilian company large quantities of magneticcard reading
devices are being brought to the inspection points to facilitate
the reading of the magnetic cards these nonJewish workers must
carry

Most of the
people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily
business some work in the fields some own small shops others are
older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee  Is that so hard to
imagine 

quickly followed by

SOME young men usually aged between  to  years are members of
the Lebanese resistance  Even the inhabitants of the village do not
know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often
suspect who they are and what they are up to

This is the standard method for claiming noncombatant status even
for the commanders of combat

These young men are
supported financially by Iran most of the time  They sneak arms and
ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
for Israeli patrols  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians

Innocent civilians  Like the ones who set up the booby traps or
engaged in shootouts with soldiers or attack them with grenades or
axes

We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics and we figure that this is

And the rest of the world is getting used to Arab tactics of claiming
innocence for even the most guilty of the vile murderers among them
Keep it up long enough and it will backfire but good

   The comparison of the Palestinian situation with the Holocaust
is insulting and completely false  Any person making such a rude
and false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust or also
ignorant of the situation in the mideast or is an antisemite

   To compare a complicated political situation with the genocide
of  Jews is racist in and of itself

   As someone who reads Israeli newpapaers every day I can state
with absolute certainty that anybody who relies on western media
to get a picture of what is happening in Israel is not getting an
accurate picture  There is tremendous bias in those stories that
do get reported  And the stories that NEVER get mentioned create
a completely false picture of the mideast

Subject Final Solution for Gaza 


Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto 


While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto they
repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
attempt to starve the Gazans

    Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting
    and racist beyond belief  The attempts to quiet any violence
    in the Gaza Strip are just that  The efforts to quell murder
    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and
    came AFTER the violence  It was not an arbitrary racial move
    like the nazi treatment of Jews  Jews had NOT committed acts
    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza  I find
    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than
    antiIsrael bigotry


The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks
The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza some  people by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel

    It is NOT punishment but protection from repeated attacks by
    residents of Gaza  You selfservingly omit any references to
    WHY Israel has had to take action  Apparaently the deaths of
    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation a
    racist ommission on your part


While Polish nonJews risked their lives to save Jews from the
Ghetto no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
the Gazan resistance The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice A population denied basic human rights is entitled to
rise up against its tormentors

    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is
    also recognized by international law  Israeli civilians have
    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis  If this wave
    of murder does not matter to you then your posturing for the
    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing
    but an antiIsrael charade


As is known the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of
Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel although they are
considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels shops
and fields

    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli
    citizenship and were denied  I have heard of no such denials
    taking place  Can you document this or is this more of your
    stupid and innacurate propaganda  The truth is that if Gazan
    residents applied for citizenship HAMAS would murder them as
    collaborators


	     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in
Israel They may not live there for these areas are reserved for
the Master Race

    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase  How very easy you
    attack a people when you omit facts which fly in the face of
    your pure racism  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the
    racists that you are  Do you believe that all Jews must have
    the same bigoted makeup as you

    Here's another little fly in your ointment about the 'master
    race' for you to avoid

    Two months ago a plane with  Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to
    seek asylum in the middle east  Four Arab nations refused to
    grant them asylum  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the
    responsibility for them they were allowed into Israel  Yes
    Israel  But when the plane landed the Israeli Arabs who had
    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved
    with the rescue project because they felt that it would make
    Israel look good  It was more important to avoid any good PR
    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims  Israel moved
    them to a kibbutz where they are safe and secure  The truth
    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back
    on Muslims in need more than Israel has  Even in the case of
    the  deportees Lebanon was willing to let their socalled
    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary
    in Lebanon

    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other
    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel  Hundreds of
    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait just
    because they were Palestinian  The truth is that your phoney
    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an
    excuse to attack Israel  You are part of the ignorant effort
    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to
    attacking Israel  But the truth is there are greater reasons
    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians  To disregard
    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oilrich
    nations who do nothing for these people is to use the plight
    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews or
    your hatred of Israel  Antisemitism and antiZionism is NOT
    the same as proPalestinian and anyone who insists that it is
    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare


The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the
right to self administration  They selected Jews to pacify the
occupied population and preventing any form of resistance Some
Jewish collaborators were killed Israel also wishes to rule over
Gaza through Arab collaborators

    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your
    racism cannot be disguised  Jews had never declared war on a
    Polish people  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives or
    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks  To take
    something like the Warsaw Ghettothe creation of which you do
    not even bother to discussand the uprising that followed is
    to degrade the dead and to show that intelligent debate on a
    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview  You
    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of
    the Islamic Resistance Movement  Here is arguably the single
    most antisemitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf yet it
    is totally disregarded in your rantings  Your racism is most
    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation  If it
    were considered you might actually have to deal with mideast
    problems in a balanced manner rather than in an antisemitic
    manner


As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible
with basic human rights and international law that of becoming
Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
selfdetermination it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish
society does not consider Gazans full human beings

    And just how was Gaza obtained  Do you forget that Israel is
    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it but had
    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start  Did you know land
    Israel captures in wars wars which other nations have ALWAYS
    started aren't the same as Israel and they are subject to a
    completely different set of international laws  Since you do
    continuously refer to international law would you please say
    what specific international laws Israel is violating


						   This attitude
is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews

    I can cite  reasons why it is not


                                                             The
current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are
consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister
Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'

    Where is this quote  I have never heard Rabin assert that he
    wished such a thing  Since you are in general a liar you'll
    have to provide the entire quote with source or this effort
    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications


                                           One is led to ask
oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister
goals towards the Gazans  Whether they have some Final Solution
up their sleeve 

    Only you are led to ask such a loaded racist intellectually
    dishonest question  You inability to come to terms with what
    you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order


I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
they can to help the Gazans regain their full human civil and
political rights to which they are entitled as human beings

    Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran
    or Iraq or Yemen or Saudi Arabia or Syria  Do you have an
    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades  Or
    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait  Or what
    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims  Do you think the
    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims
    in Bosnia are enduring  Why are you indifferent to the death
    and suffering of people  Why do you not care that these folk
    are being exterminated  Why do you not care that only Israel
    has given any of these people safe haven  Could it be due to
    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing  The
    people in Gaza are not being exterminated  They aren't being
    killed  They aren't being raped  They aren't being starved
    They aren't being driven from their lands  They are not kept
    from receiving food or other supplies  But the Bosnians are
    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the
    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your
    life to attacking in the guise of compassion

    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual
    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself
    what your real motives are  Do not flatter yourself into the
    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you  In your
    case it is clear that hate beats out love every time  Maybe
    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born
    a Jew  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is
    being dumped on all other Jews  Why else would you suggest a
    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence  Maybe these
    fits of antisemitism are a result of being cut off from your
    own people for an extended period  Whatever the case may be
    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to
    appear to be  When you realize that you can't care for other
    people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do
    some good

    But for now you are a fruad

   Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin

   There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII

   Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more

   In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place

   People die that is all No one gets killed

   Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american
   napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all

   Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in therethey
   may be thought it was like snifing cocaine No

   What do you think of this  Isn't it stupid to say so
   Well it is as stupid as what you said Next time you want to lie do it
   intelligently

   Sincerely yours

   Hassan

Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin But there was no massacre First
of all the village housed many armed troops Secondly the Irgun
and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians
The village was attacked only for its military significance In fact
a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before
the attack was to begin

By all rational standards Dir Yassin was not a massacre The killing
was unintentional The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops
Thus it was attacked for its military significance It was not
attacked with intentions of killing any civilians

To even compare Dir Yassin in which some  or so Arabs died to the
Holocaust is absurd The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians The
village had almost  inhabitants most of whom survived

    Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets the
 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin
on April   targeted the village for its military importance
Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem which the Arabs had
blockaded and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars
Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens
in Jerusalem

    Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin but that attack does
not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to
paint The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about
 In  however Eric Silver of The Guardian Britain
interviewed a survivor Mophammed Sammour who testified that  out
of a population of  were killed 'About three days after the
massacre' Sammour explained 'representatives of each of the five
clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a
list of the people who had not been found alive We went through the
names  Nothing has happend since  to make me think this figure
was wrong'

    Unlike the PLO's deliberate attacks on civilians the killing of
civilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated The attackers left open
an escape corridor from the village and more than  residents left
unharmed After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then fired
on the Jewish troops some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers and
civilians indiscriminately Independent observers told The Guardian
that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women

   Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto 
   

   While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto they
   repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
   attempt to starve the Gazans

   

Elias should the families of the children who were stabbed in their
high school by a Palestinian freedom fighter be the ones who offer
their help to the Gazans Perhaps it should be the families of the 
Israelis who were murdered last month by Palestinian freedom
fighters

The Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and
their families from being sent to Nazi gas chambers Groups like Hamas
and the Islamic Jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all
Jews into the sea Perhaps we should persuade Jewish people to help
these wnderful freedom fighters attain this ultimate goal

Maybe the freedom fighters will choose to spare the cooperative Jews
Is that what you are counting on Elias  the pity of murderers

You say your mother was Jewish How ashamed she must be of her son I
am sorry Mrs Davidsson

p  first paragraph

In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who
 had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians
 abandoned the struggle During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of
 these poor devils were cruelly put to death I was sickened by the
 brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest Some
 mercifully were shot Many of them were burned to death The method
 employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after
 crowding the hut with Turks set fire to the straw

The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians  years ago in
xSoviet Armenia is being reenacted again  this time in Azerbaijan

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today

 year old Hatin Nine telling

''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes They told
me We won't kill you But the babies have to die in front of your eyes''

 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu

 ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours
  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said You are
  Turks you must die''

 year old Gulsum Huseyin

 ''They bayonetted my  year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes''

Are these stories lies Have the eyewitnesses been daydreaming
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists too Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article TheyBritish reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists What is more here are the pictures Pictures
of people who were bayonetted whose eyes were gouged ears cut off

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these lies They are saying
exaggeration That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in  hours instead of  Or Gulsum Huseyin's
 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word

Some of the western press' led by some French Newspapers ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed So were the
French TV channels The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCEConference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe and rules all designed to fight against human
rights violations International reactions must be made with international
cooperation With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty Where
is the cooperation Where are the reactions And the intellectuals
journalists writers TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of human rights
Where are you

In  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi
concentration camps the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first
Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis In  this battalion
had grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of Dro
the butcher who is the architect of the coldblooded genocide of 
million Turks and Kurds between  An Armenian National Council
was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin which was
recognized by the Nazis Encouraged by this the Armenians summarily
formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the
principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the
Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination
of the Jews

This ArmenianNazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they backstabbed and
exterminated  million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army

p  second paragraph

 I had received further very definite information of horrors that
  had been committed by the Armenian soldiery in Kars Plain and as
  I had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their
  treatment of my own detached parties I had wired to Tiflis from
  Zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the Armenians should not
  be left in independent command of the Moslem population as their
  troops being without discipline and not under effective control
  atrocities were constantly being committed for which we should
  with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible'

	If Turks in Greece were so badly mistreated how come they
elected twom not one but two representatives in the Greek government

Pardon me

Greece Government RailRoads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies

While World Human Rights Organizations Scream Greeks
Persistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity
of Dr Sadik Ahmet and Mr Ahmet Faikoglu


Dr Sadik Ahmet Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament Visits US

Washington DC July  Doctor Sadik Ahmet one of the two ethnic
Turkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june  through
July th and held meetings with human rights organizations and
highlevel US officials in Washington DC and New York

At his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC
Sadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated
six demands from Greek government

Ahmet said our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from
Western capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights
What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same
as South African Apartheid He added What we are facing is pure
Greek hatred and racial discrimination

Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece
he said We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of  ethnic
Turks Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this
people have stayed out of Greece for too long They are Greek citizens
and are residing in Greece even one of them is actively serving in
the Greek army Besides other nonTurkish citizens of Greece are
not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of
GreekAmericans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in
the United States

We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights We want Greek
government to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights
Our people are waiting since  years to get driving licenses The Greek
government is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating
our buildings or building new ones If your name is Turkish you are
not hired to the government offices

Furthermore we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity
in business They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the
economic life of Greece In my case they denied me a medical license
necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact
that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the
necessary steps in my career

We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks We are not allowed
to call ourselves Turks I myself have been subject of a number of
law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself
a Turk

We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion

In separate interview with The Turkish Times Dr Sadik Ahmet stated
that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of
Greek laws ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks As an example
he said there are about  telephone subscribers in Selanik Thessaloniki
and only about  of them are Turks That is not because Turks do not
want to have telephone services at their home and businesses He said
that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out
of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated
this fact openly to him While there is no minimum qualification
requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least  of the votes
they imposed this requirement for the independent parties including
the Turkish candidates

Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine Komotini Greece 
He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 
he served in the Greek military as an infantryman

In  he got involved with community affairs for the first time
by collecting  signatures to protest the unjust implementation
of laws against ethnic Turks In  he was arrested by the police
for collecting signatures

Tim you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been
disarmed Hezbollah remains the only independent militia Hezbollah does
not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up
Sheikh Mosavi his wife and young son Of course if Israel would withdraw
from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't
make the Lebanese so mad as to do that Furthermore with Hezbollah
subsequently disarmed it would not be possible


Just to address this one point what about the two Katyusha rocket
attacks made within Lebanon for which Fatah claimed responsibility
I didn't realize that one can use Katyushas while onr is disarmed
Also Page  of today's New York Times Faisal Saleh a high ranking
Fatah official and his  month old son were gunned down in Beirut
by members of Abu Nidal  There have been  assasination attempts
in  alone in the fued between these two factions resulting in

 promising the final battle between Muslims and Jews in which the
 stons and the trees will cry for the Muslims to come and kill the
 Jews hiding behind them makes jokes about Jews dying from heart
 attacks etc to realize his objective stance on the matters involved

Don't worry Danny every blatantly violent and abusive posting made by
Hamzah is immediately forwarded to the operator of the system in which he
has an account  I'd imagine they have quite a file started on this
fruitcakeand have already indicated that they have rules governing
racist and threatening use of their resources  I'd imagine he'll be out

Arab leaders don't have to cheat they are actually allowed to have four wives
Are you implying above that Arab leaders are gays Aren't there Jewish gays too

Arab leaders are now following by Islamic rules  Or is it only applicable
in cases like this  

I remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife
Saddam also has a mistress  Assad's brother has a wife and several
mistresses and those 'emirs' in the Gulf have within their lifetimes
wives in the double digitas only they manage to keep four at a time

This is all irrelevant  It takes a lot more than infidelity to make these
leaders ruthless and corrupt  Maybe Netanyahu thought he could 'cleanse'
himself by making such a public confession  Does the average secular Israeli
care though  The Mossad probably applauded him

If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda then
consider the Washington Post's handling of American events to be propoganda
too  What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion  I
wouldn't compare it to Nazi propoganda either  Unless you want to provide
some evidence of Israeli inaccuracies or parallels to Nazism I suggest you
keep your mouth shut  I'm sick and tired of all you antisemites comparing
Israel to the Nazis and yes in my opinion if you compare Israel to the Nazis
you are an antisemite because you know damn well it isn't true and you are

interesting that you are basing the truth on Israeli propaganda

Since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either Arab or
Palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn
Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another The only way
to determine that is to try and get beyond the writer's political
agenda whether it is on or against our side

 Please can you tell us why those quotes are crapbecause you do not
 like thembecause they really existwhy

 As I said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source
 given by Serdar Argic 

 You couldn't reject it


In addition the Author's Preface was written on January   BUT THE BOOK
was published in 

 Here we go again
 In the book I have both the front page and the Author's preface give
 the same year  and  January  respectively
 Anyone can check it at herhis libraryif not I can send you the copies of

I really don't care what year it was first published or 
What I care about is what the book writes about murders torturesetin
the given quotes by Serdar Argic and your denial of these quotesand your
groundless accussations etc




DD I can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim

VD what is new

I will post a gif file but I am not going go through the effort to show there
is some Turkish modified republication of the book like last time


 I claim I have a book in my hand published in first publication
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in Serdar Argic's Reference hasYou couldn't reject itbut now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around

 Let's see how you liefrom 'nonexisting' quotes to republication

 First you said there was no such a quote in the given referenceYou
 called Serdar Argic a liar
 I said to you NO MRDavidian there exactly existed such a quote
 I even gave the call number page numbersyou could't reject it

 And now you are lying again and talking about modifiedrepublished book
without any proof how when where by whom etc
 by the way how is it possible to republish the book in  if it was
  first published in your claimI am sure that you have some 'pretty
  well suited theories' as usual

 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and MrDavidian's liesI also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use which are
                  R 

  and the page numbers to verify the quotes and 




It is not possible that 's text has  pages mine has  and yours has


 Now are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying it is
 not possible If not what is your point

 Differences in the number of pages
 Mine was published in Serdar Argic's was in 
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter
 charachter in both publicationsetc etc does it give you an idea

 The issue was not the number of pages the book hasor the year
 first published
 And you tried to hide the whole point
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed torturedetc by Armeniansand those quotes given
 by Serdar Argic exist
 It was the issue wasn'tit

 you were not able to object itDoes it bother you anyway

 You name all these tortures and murders by Armenians as a crap

	On the contrary Armenians will get away with the genocide of
	 Azeri people

	Armenians already got away with raping torturing and massacering
	millions of innocent Moslem peoples of Eastern Anatolia

Not this time Enis Furthermore a new generation has risen  equipped
with a deep sense of commitment politically mature and conscious who
determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause through all necessary means
ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle In
other words what we have is a demand from the fascist government of
xSoviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our
people


 The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination
  of the Muslim population in the Soviet Republic of Armenia Karabag
  Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the
  extermination of  million Muslims by the Armenian Government
  during the WWI and of over  million European Jews during the WWII
                  Tovfik Kasimov  Azeri Leader  September  


 Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against
  Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia as well as the Soviet Republic
  of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan
  are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide
  perpetrated by the Armenian Government  years ago against the
  Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these
  lands         Cebbar Leygara  Kurdish Leader  October

Well your Armenian grandparents were fascist As early as  K S
Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians

        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism'

At that time he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would
actively assume a proGerman stance and even collaborate in World
War II His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish
population of eastern Anatolia However extreme rightwing ideological
tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before
the outbreak of the Second World War

In  for example O Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted
in the 'Hairenik Weekly'

The race is force it is treasure If we follow history we shall
 see that races due to their innate force have created the nations
 and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to
 the race after becoming a nation Today Germany and Italy are
 strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race
 On the other hand Russia is comparatively weak because she is
 bereft of social sanctities

After having read this group for some time I am appalled at its lack of

Well these are Armenian and Jewish scholars not me Denying the obvious

The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over  square miles The estimated population
 of the entire region in  was  of whom   percent were
 Armenian   percent Georgian and   percent Moslem
 Of the latter group  were Tatars Paradoxically barely onethird
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds Erevan
 uezd the administrative center of the province had only  Armenians
 as compared to  Moslems By the time of the Russian Census of 
 however the Armenians had established a scant majority  percent in the
 guberniia it had risen by  to  percent or  of the 
 inhabitants This impressive change in the province's ethnic character
 notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian
 Republic a solid block of  Tartars who continued to dominate the
 southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia

 Transcaucasia

In  '' percent Turk

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work
 of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village
 Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets
 completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border
 into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of
 Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the
 scattered bones of the dead

 In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul

           The world's inaction when the conflict began over the mostly
Christian Armenian enclave inside Muslim Azerbaijan might have
encouraged the conflict in BosniaHerzegovina said the
Moscowbased activist who's part Armenian

No kidding The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces
massacred  million defenseless Turkish women children and elderly
people burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated
the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between
 Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today
in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide
that is hard to match A hundred years ago Armenians again thought
they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the
Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models Several Armenian
terror groups like ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle
resorted to the same tactics in the s butchering scores of innocent
Turks and their families in the United States and Europe It seems that
they are doing it again at a different scale in fascist xSoviet Armenia
today

A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri
town of Khojali Pop  in Karabagh Azerbaijan is reported to
have taken place on the night of Feb  under a coordinated military
operation of the th mechanized division of the CIS army and the
Armenian insurgents Close to  people are reported to have been
massacred Elderly and children were not spared Many were badly beaten
and shot at close range A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed
the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian
insurgency The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the
Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling City
hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant
were killed Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to
condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its
sovereignty

HELSINKI WATCH PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE

Ankara AA  In a page report  of the Helsinki Watch  it is
stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced
with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being
implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government
should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of
minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and
in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the Turkish
Minority in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify
themselves as 'Turks'

GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS

The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek
state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish
minority with Turkey

Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is
called Greek  by ethnic  definition only  the religion  of the
minority in  Western Thrace is  considered In an  interview with
the Greek  newspaper Ethnos he said  I am a Greek  citizen of
Turkish origin The individuals of the minority living in Western
Trace are also Turkish

Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in
Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement
signed in  Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey
in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace

Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr
SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority
Faikoglu said  In fact we  helped Greece Because  we prevented
Greece the cradle of democracy from losing face before European
countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal
rights

On TurcoGreek relations he pointed  out that both countries are
predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical
reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign
powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by

MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE

Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in
Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state according to a
Court Summons No  obtained by MILS

  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  or Anastasios  Bulis
have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in
an Athenian magazine

  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly
magazine  ENA  on  March      and  said  that  they  as
Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would
field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the upcoming  Greek
general election

  Bulev said in the interview I am not Greek I am Macedonian
Sideropoulos said  in the  article that Greece  should recognise
Macedonia  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations
against  Greece are  tales We  are in  a panic  to secure  the
border at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC
are falling

  The  main  charge  against  the two  according  to  the  court
summons  was   that  they  have   spreadintentionally  false
information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the
citizens  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the
international interests of the country Greece

  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a
Macedonian ethnicity There are believed to be between  to
  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece  largely
concentrated in the north It is  a crime against the Greek state
if anyone declares themselves Macedonian

  In    Greece   SerbiaYugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned
Macedonia into three  pieces In  Albania  took  Macedonian
villages The part under  SerboYugoslav occupation broke away in
  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia  There are  
million Macedonians in the Republic  in Bulgaria 
in Albania and  in Serbia proper

  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian
human rights in  Greece and lost his job as  a forestry worker a
few years ago  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in
the mediteranean Only pressure from Amnesty International forced
the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of
Florina Lerin in Northern  Greece Aegean Macedonia where the
majority of ethnic Macedonians live

  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in
which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent
especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its
northern neighbour the Republic of Macedonia

  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned
Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks who
largely live in Western Thrace But it remains to be seen if the
US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections
are over

Congratulations to the brave men of the Lebanese resistance With every

bankruptcy of Israel's occupation and drawing attention to the Israeli
government's policy of reckless disregard for civilian life


	Apparently the Hizbollah were encouraged by Brad's cheers
	good job Brad Someone forgot to tell them though that
	Brad asks them to place only Israeli sons in the grave
	not daughters Paraphrasing a bit with every rocket that

Would you tell me which Arab country is prohipiting the Jews from
migrating to Palestine

the last arab country was syria but not all of them
migrated due to the jewish state economical and
securital dilemma

As usual when Salah is not totally racist she manages to get
virtually all the facts wrong

Assad pledged to allow Jews to leave Syria but not to go to Israel

Unfortunately not all of them have escaped yet but not because they
don't want to leave  rather Assad went back on his word and stopped
issuing travel permits  He claimed bureaucratic snags but everyone
knows it was a tactic to pressure Israel

Israel with other nations of that geographical region to which the notion
of a free unmonitored by the government press corps would be a joke

As for the notion that Israel threatens the human rights of Palestinians by

Israel will talk concessions on both sides for peace Not before

What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum  It is the home of the muslim a
s well as jewish religion among others  Heck nobody ever mentions what Yitza
k Shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the
 way Abdul Nidal does today  Seems Isrealis are nowhere above Arabs so theref
ore they have a right to Jerusaleum as much as Isreal does

   THE US HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM A COSTLY AND DANGEROUS MISTAKE

                         by Theodore J O'Keefe

HARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT within clear view of the Jefferson
Memorial an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial
has arisen on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States of
America a costly and dangerous mistake  On ground where no monument yet
marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all
races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation sits today a
massive and costly edifice devoted above all to a contentious and false
version of the ordeal in Europe during World War II of nonAmerican
members of a minority sectarian group  Now in the deceptive guise of
tolerance the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda
campaign financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer
in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America

After reading the first paragraph a quick scan confirmed my first
impression this is a bunch of revisionist and antisemitic hogwash

The NY Times reported on April   that the museum was built
through private contributions on Federal land  Your hatemongering
article is devoid of current and historical fact intellectual content
and social value  Down the toilet it goes

    Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto 
    

    While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto they
    repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
    attempt to starve the Gazans

    

 The Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and
 their families from being sent to Nazi gas chambers Groups like Hamas
 and the Islamic Jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all
 Jews into the sea Perhaps we should persuade Jewish people to help
   
 these wnderful freedom fighters attain this ultimate goal

 Maybe the freedom fighters will choose to spare the cooperative Jews
 Is that what you are counting on Elias  the pity of murderers

 You say your mother was Jewish How ashamed she must be of her son I
 am sorry Mrs Davidsson

 Harry

OK its my turn

       DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA 

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed
to Islamic movements and the PLO it simply can't be proven as part of their
plan 

Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity
since it was coined by Bnai Brith

What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in as far as I can get from the Arab media
is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic
Law This would be a reversal of the  situation in which the Jews in
Palestine took control of the land and its mostly Muslim inhabitants

However whoever committed crimes against humanity torture blowing up their
homes murders must be treated and tried as a war criminal The political
thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the
Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice

As for the PLO I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind

Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true
superpower in the region the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the
Jews used to establish their state  Religion

    The comparison of the Palestinian situation with the Holocaust
 is insulting and completely false  Any person making such a rude
 and false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust or also
 ignorant of the situation in the mideast or is an antisemite

    To compare a complicated political situation with the genocide
 of  Jews is racist in and of itself

First of all I never said the Holocaust I said before the
Holocaust I'm not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more
about Nazi Germany than most people maybe including you
	What I resent is ignorant statements that call people
names when they disagree with your position Opposing the
atrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies
as antisemitism If you think name calling is a valid form of
argument in intellectual circles you need to get out more
often
	I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII
justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government Any
attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is
not appreciated

 Tim
	First let me correct myself in that it was Goerbels and
not Goering Airforce who ran the Nazi propaganda machine I
agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased But I
believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the
american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli
accounts the Americans are biased I just thought that the
Israelis had more motivation for bias
	The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its
gross violation of human rights However the US has vetoed most
such attempts It is interesting to note that the US is often
the only country opposing such condemnation well the US and
Israel It is also interesting to note that that means
other western countries realize these human rights violations
So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all

The latest Israeli proposal first proposed in February of  contains
the following assumptions concerning the nature of any interim status refering to the WB and Gaza the Palestinians implemented by negotiations It
states that
   Israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status
    is agreed upon
   The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and
    coordination with Israel
   Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the
    areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education
    business tourism labor and social welfare local police
    local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious
    affairs

The Palestinian counterproposal of March 
   There will be no limitations on its PISGA powers and responsibilities
    except those which derive from its character as an interim arrangement
   It will have a strong police force responsible for security and public
    order in the OPT
   It can request the assistance of a UN peacekeeping force
   Disputes with Israel over selfgoverning arrangements will be settled by
    a committee composed of representatives of the five permanent members of
    the UN Security Council the Secretary General of the UN the PISGA
    Jordan Egypt Syria and Israel

I have read that there will be some concrete proposals concerning creation
of a palestinian police force during the talk's next stage  Does anyone
knows of the details of this idea How does it fit with the differing
conceptions listed above

Aryans who do not base their reasoning on Nazi ideology are racists

Thus spoke an American citizen in the name of Judaism If this is Judaism
I think Judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerous
philosophy

I suspect however that Martin Buber Albert Einstein and other Jewish
scholars would have rather converted to Christianity than stay Jews if
they would have perceived Judaism as such a perverted philosophy

Those who wish to learn something about the perversion of Judaism
should consult the masterly work by Yehoshua Harkabi who was many
years the head of Israeli Intelligence and an opponent of the PLO His
latest book was published in English and includes a very detailed analysis
of JudeoNazism

I must say I was appalled by the American Jewish Council's open letter
America is not the world's policeman  We cannot and should not take it upon
ourselves to solve the problems of the entire world  America's young men and
women should not be sent to Yugoslavia period  If people feel strongly
enough let them go as individuals to fight alongside the butchers of their
choice
We have a volunteer army  The argument you gave only applies if we have a
draft
Huh

Sorry I misread your remark about young men and women  Though I am now
unsure what that sentence does mean

Furthermore people do not become butchers by being ethnic
cleansed  Or do you automatically call them butchers because they are Muslim
I am disappointed in your logic especially coming from a stalwart of
sciskeptic

You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to
help the butchers of their choice  Since the primary targets of help are
Muslim victims of ethnic cleansing you imply that such Muslim victims are
butchers

 People become butchers by butchering  There have been atrocities on all
sides

This implies both sides are equal  True it may sometimes be difficult or
impossible to determine which side is the victim but that does not mean that
victims do not exist  Would you in WWII have said that there were atrocities
on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans

These people have been butchering each other for centuries  When one
side wins and gets what it wants it will stop

Yes but both sides want different things  The Muslims chiefly want to not
be ethnic cleansed  The Serbians want to ethnic cleanse the Muslims  It
is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants but the
things that the two sides want are not equivalent

 Quite an impressive leap of reasoning to assume that I am so racist as to
call someone a butcher because they are Muslim  In fact I think on the
contrary the media fixation on this war as opposed to the dozens upon dozens
of civil wars which have been fought in the recent past is because these are
white people in Europe  When atrocities occur in the Third World there is
not as much news coverage and not nearly the same level of outrage

I recall before we did anything for Somalia apparent leftwingers saying
that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to
Somalia was because the Somalis are thirdworlders who Americans consider
unworthy of help  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to
the opposite place than that predicted by the theory

For that matter this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to
help the Serbs  After all they're Christian and the Muslims are not  If
the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are
less like us why does everyone want to help the side that is less like us
Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think

 I complained about the US taking the point in Bosnia when the Europeans
  should be doing it
  Ken says the Bosnians are morally superior to the Serbians

This implies both sides are equal  True it may sometimes be difficult or
impossible to determine which side is the victim but that does not mean that
victims do not exist

Yes victims exist  There are a staggering number of victims in the world and
more each day  I think on balance intervention would create more victims
including American ones  Since the first responsibility of the US government
is to protect Americans I think they serve that role best by staying away
from Bosnia and other regional conflicts

Would you in WWII have said that there were atrocities
on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans

Of course not  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany
either and except for smallscale resistance and a few larger uprisings did
not have an army or a government

These people have been butchering each other for centuries  When one
side wins and gets what it wants it will stop

Yes but both sides want different things  The Muslims chiefly want to not
be ethnic cleansed  The Serbians want to ethnic cleanse the Muslims  It
is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants but the
things that the two sides want are not equivalent

I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a
colonizing power  driving away andor eliminating the population of an
area they want to control  The US tried basically that in Vietnam the Iraqis
in Kuwait the Israelis in Palestine South Africa etc etc etc  It sucks
it's ugly and it's saddening  But it is not genocide

It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in
Yugoslavia  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked they
should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold

 I said the fixation on Bosnia is due to it being in a European country
  rather than the third world

I recall before we did anything for Somalia apparent leftwingers saying
that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to
Somalia was because the Somalis are thirdworlders who Americans consider
unworthy of help  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to
the opposite place than that predicted by the theory

I am a staunch Republican BTW  The irony of arguing against military
intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me  I was opposed
to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons although clearly it was
not nearly as risky

For that matter this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to
help the Serbs  After all they're Christian and the Muslims are not  If
the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are
less like us why does everyone want to help the side that is less like us
Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think

Well one thing you have to remember is the press likes a good story   Good
for business don't you know  And BTW not everyone wants to help the
side that is less like us

I never said the two sides were morally equivalent I said neither one is
innocent

There are just too many good reasons to stay away

 The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders
   in any way we do it  Put another way we have no assistance to offer the
   Europeans which they do not already possess themselves  It is not good to
   promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible
   for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world

 Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure  Full
   stop

 It is by no means clear what intervention would accomplish nor that it
   would necessarily help the victims  It is not clear what the goal is and
   at what point any commitment could be ended

You seem to oppose ending the embargo  You know it is difficult for Europeans

During WWII the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite
German occupation  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides
sponsoring peace conferences they would have no problem putting any kind of
weapon they wanted into Bosnia

I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law
forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia including via third
parties  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active
role would be too great  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in
the outcome of the war

Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press  And that's
about all we have to go on isn't it

And I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around  There are many levels
at which people react to what they see  At the most fundamental level you
do not have to consciously recognize the racial element  you simply tend to
empathize more with people who are like yourself  As far preferring
Christian over Moslem I am an atheist myself and I think you'll agree that
in the US the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of
religion nor give it a particularly important place in their world view

quite a difference in these two statements regardless of what Nazi
revisionists say

SY My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in
SY todays Georgia There were villages KurdTurk different Turkic groups
SY Georgian muslimchristian Armenian and Farsi Very near to eachother
SY The people living there were aware of their differences They were
SY different people For example my grandfather would not have been happy
SY if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy But that did not
SY mean that they were willing to kill eachother No They were neighbors

OK

SY Armenians killed Turks Which Armenians Their neoghbors As far as my
SY grandparents are concerned the Armenians attacked first but these
SY Armenians were not their neighbors They came from other places Maybe
SY first they had a training at some place They were taught to kill people
SY to hate TurksKurds It seems so

There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the
Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in  with that of the Armeno
Georgian conflicts of late  The argument is not whether Armenians ever
killed in their collective existence but rather the wholesale destruction of
Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government An Armenian
Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak Lori and Pambak after
the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region cannot be equated with the
extermination of Anatolian Armenians Many Armenians and Georgians died
in this area in the scramble to reoccupy these lands and the lack of
preparation for the winter months This is not the same as the Turkish
genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier hundreds of kilometers
away

SY Anyway but after they killedraped Turks and other muslim people
SY around people assumed that 'Armenians killed us raped our women'
SY not a particular group of people trained in some camps maybe backed
SY by some powerful states After that step you cannot explain these
SY people not to hate all Armenians

I don't follow perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light

SY So what am I trying to point out First at least for that region
SY you cannot blame TurksKurds etc since it was a self defense situation
SY Most of the Armenians I think are not to blame either But since some
SY people started that fire it is not easy to undo it There are facts
SY People cannot trust eachother easily It is very difficult to establish
SY a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with
SY different ethnicculturalreligious backgrounds but it is unfortunately
SY very easy to start a fire

Again the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in  had little to
do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey It is interesting that
the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation Armenia Azerbaijan
and Georgia made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through
Tiflis on their way to Baku in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians
militarily Of course as Turkish troops marched across what was left of
Caucasian Armenia many Armenians went north and such population movement
caused problems with the locals This is in no comparison with events  years
earlier in eastern Anatolia My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek 
Erzinka  Erzerum  Nakhitchevan  Tiflis  Constantinople 
Massachusetts

SY My grandparents were not bloodthirsty people We did not experience
SY what they had to endure They had to leave their lands there were
SY ladies old ladies all of her children killed while she forced to
SY witness Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves
SY unattractive I don't want to go into any graphic detail

My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women and paste
potato skins on his face to look ugly The Turks would kill any Armenian
young man on sight in Dersim Because their family was rather influential
local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late This is why I am alive
today

SY You may think that my sources are biased They were biased in some sense
SY They experienced their own pain of course That is the way it is  But
SY as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before Why
SY should they become enemies

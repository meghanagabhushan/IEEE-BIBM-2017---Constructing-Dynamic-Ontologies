 I can't find my source
 But  If you state that you will retract your claim I'll go dig one up
 at the library  Fair enough

 	ARE YOU SERIOUS  I'm not talking about retracting anything until
 you have produced SOMETHING

 	If you were not just talking off the top of your head I would
 assume that you have SOME memory of what your source is

 	PUT UP NOW without conditions


Yes very serious  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that
Rudman says he doesn't believe Perot was investigating him  You claim
Perot was investigating him  If you will state that you were in error
on this point provided I produce the source I'll go dig it up

Now give me one reason why I should go to the trouble if you won't
agree to this  It is simple enough you know  But I don't have time
to waste if you'll just blow it off with more of the tripe you usually

  what the appeal to allegedly rational people of such a

  now  my atlas is from  the right to any special legal
  status or title based on a mere accident of birth

To begin with it's quite inexpensive compared to here what with our
having six former presidents still alive drawing pensions expense
accounts and secret service protection

  Maybe so but they were after all President  In the corporate
  world it's SOP for retiring senior executives to be given nice
  pensions etc  The point is that they performed a service and
  this is part of the compensation package   The only service
  royals have to perform for their free ride is being born

We might be better off had some of our former presidents done nothing

	Again the main point

	No human being not yet born can be bound to any contract

Wrong  It's possible to inherit a debt

	Further no third party can be bound to any contract that
they are not a party to

See above

	The Constitution for the United States is just such a contract
No third party can be bound to it Further no human who is not specifically
mentioned in Article  and has not taken an oath or made an affirmation
to uphold said Const can be bound to uphold or obey it

The Constitution is not a contract  It is a statute  Please
Mr Teel or anyone show me one case where the US
Constitution or any state constitution is considered a
contract

	The Const is designed to limit the powers of government not to
bind THE PEOPLE

It is also designed to delineate the powers of the US
government

The tax protesters are legally correct but they are put in jail anyway

Hello  What the Sloan decision means is that the tax protestors
were wrong

The weakness of the governments legal position is shown by the fact that when
someone protesting tax or gun laws on legal grounds gets a federal jury trial
very rare the feds blatantly stack the jury with the same old faces turning
up time after time

Demonstrate please  The rules of procedure make this very
unlikely

However Teel should have mentioned that though his advice is legally sound if
you follow it you will probably wind up in jail

FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

Which makes it legally unsound  If I were representing Mr Teel

Homosexuals have been lying about the  number for so long that
the politicians are running scared of them  Of course homosexuals
lying should be no surprise


How can you lie about something that no one knows for sure  I am the first
to state that the  figure may be too high but it may just be too low
depending on what you are talking about

Keep in mind that there are 'practicing' heterosexuals that are actually
gay  These people chose to take a road that avoids being harassed and
they wanted to 'fitin' with everyone other 'normal' person

But let's get off of this irrational behavior of calling everyone a liar
you cannot even start to support such claims

Also the corrupt criminal and lying nature of Kinsey's work which
provides much of the justification for homosexual rights in the modern
era should make people step back for a moment and question the rest
of the crap that they have been forcefed by the news media

This sure sounds definitive  How do you label Kinsey's work like this
from that factually based and scientific journal WSJ


Relations between people to be by mutual consent or not at all

This is an interesting statement  Do you realize how many things you do
your life that are not based on 'mutual consent' and that it may be
required on occasion that all parties may not be mutually consenting

 If homosexuals did keep themselves in the privacy of their own home this
 wouldn't be a problem  However there are various 'cliques' sp that
 don't  They want to present the argument that it is just as moral and
 right as heterosexuality

 You know I'm offended by newspapers publicly announcing weddings
 Heterosexuals should keep their nutpials out of the public eyes They
 should be banned from wearing wedding rings From having legal recognition
 of marriage

 Anything that's public and sexual don't mix

The difference of course is that we are right and you are wrong
If you are a minority that wants freedom it helps to not be
obnoxious about it  It does not surprise me that as groups like

TRANSLATION you minorities stay in predesignated areas  We the majority
are 'right' anything you do is 'wrong' since might makes right and
the majority always rules

Queer Nation become increasingly belligerent in their public
demonstrations that violence against homosexuals rises  Anything
that reminds the crazies who like to beat up homosexuals of their
presence is going to aggravate things


Oh crime prevention at its best  Well let's extrapolate this maybe if
you didn't display all of your private property then those nasty theifs
wouldn't go after it  And don't carry any money that way those muggers
won't bother you


And you still don't realize that either way it is says that homosexuals
are very dangerous to children


 So tell mewhat's immoral about homosexuality

The promiscuity and fetishism that characterizes it  The sexual
predatory component that glorifies the pursuit of candyass and
hairless cocks in the words of Le JoJo the typical homosexual

Oh I did not know that Le JoJo is a typical homosexual

Stop making statements about something you know nothing about that is
gay people  You make your sweeping generalizations with no grounding
in reality


What I hope is not true That you are a typical heterosexual  Anyone want
to comment on this

And if you are typical then I can start extrapolating a lot of interesting
conjectures about heterosexuals

I'd try a procedural approach if I could find one or recommend

Indeed  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things
Mr Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes  those
who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their
claim and  those who lose

Consider Newman v Schiff  Fd  th Cir which I've seen
cited by tax protestors other than Mr Teel as a win for Mr Schiff
Mr Schiff offered  on TV to anyone who would call in the
show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that
an individual has to file a return

Mr Newman took him up on it  Mr Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast
the next morning  Mr Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to
people who actually say the original broadcast and so there was no offer
for Mr Newman to accept and so no unilateral contract was formed and
so Mr Schiff did not have to pay 

Mr Schiff was correct and so won  So yes Mr Schiff won against a
claim on the  reward  However his win had nothing to do with
the tax code

Congress is NOT allowed to abrogate the constitutional rights and privileges
already enjoyed by persons however unless the abrogation has a rational
reason or a compelling interest to it depending on which standard is
applied This is relevant because granting a right to one class of persons
by definition ALWAYS impinges on the rights of another class or classes or
persons to some degree In the case of abortion establishing rights for
the unborn impinges GREATLY on the rights of pregnant women There has yet
to be presented a sufficient justification for such fetal rights

Recently it's occured to me that I've never heard of any PERSON ever being
tried in Federal Court for violating someone's civil rights Of course
there have been cases before the Supreme Court in which it was decided
that someone's civil rights had been violated eg Miranda Escobedo
etc but institutions were de facto the defendants not individuals Am I
mistaken Have there been similar cases against individuals in the past

I know it was used several times in the south to prosecute the murders of
blacks after all white juries had cleared the accussed

Furthermore what are the specific charges against the four LAPD officers
Which civil rights or laws are they accused of violating

I believe it is a general charge that is no specific right is mentioned

What about double jeopardy Has there been any concern that a verdict
against Koon et al might be overturned upon appeal because they're being tried
again for the same actions I thought I heard something on the news about
this

The SS has previously ruled that since the seperate governments were in
essence seperate sovereigns then double jeopardy does not apply

If this is true then could defendents also be tried under city and
county governments

This mornings paper said that the ACLU has decided to reinstate its
opposition to this kind of thing They had earlier suspended their
opposition while they examined the King case There might be hope
for the ACLU after all

declined  If you keep spending more than you earn the deficit keeps
growing  If you keep borrowing at a lesser rate than you borrowed
previously the deficit increases  You only decrease deficits when your
income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts

Figgie's book paints the real data pictorially in gory detail  Each
president essentially ran up twice as much total debt in half the time
Reagancongress was simply awful  Bushcongress was unbelievable

As a really rigorous aside to this thread

During pledge night the other night on the public channel there was an
economist who gave an hour or so presentation  His data was predictive
and based largely on population data I don't know his name but his
arguments were brilliant  He confirmed with data what many of us know
with common sense  the boom of the 's has nothing to do with government
policy particularly supply side policy since taxes do not cause
economic activities  People cause economic activity  More can be
explained by watching population waves roll through the years and
create cycles  He has made models and predictions for years well into
the middle of next century  It will be neat to see how accurate he
is

 Thanks to Kim for following up  I was hoping that someone would bring up
 the issue of cost compensation  The problem with the argument is that it
 fails to explain why kidney dialysis RD services have expanded massively in
 the last decade  After all no one is forcing private providers to offer
 this service  If they are losing money on the treatment which according
 to information I've collected from several providers they are not why
 would they not simply limit their losses by cutting back on services
 engage in effective rationing of supply rather than expand the coverage
 to a larger market that must then be compensated by raising prices in
 other areas

Perhaps there is a competitive advantage in there after all  Would
not reputable and dedicated physicians prefer to affiliate with an
institution that offers dialysis services  Would they not therefore
tend to admit patients in greater numbers to an institution that
offered a full range of diagnostic and treatment options

Undoubtedly  In fact it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete
for physicians rather than for patients that in part complicates and
undermines a simplistic freemarket analysis of the market for medical care

Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of hightech highprice
machinery They manage to make it up on other charges

Once again there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney
dialysis  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services
to a much greater volume of patients RD is still a profitable service
Otherwise one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the
vast expansion that has occurred


 Remember the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but
 make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market 

Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an
array of products at prices below cost  Are not grocery stores
embedded in a relatively free market

Can you spell loss leader  I knew you could  Grocery stores do not
attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of
it  In fact your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader
for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained

But the evidence does not support this contention  Rather it appears that
price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of
service and development of improved lowercost technology to provide
comparable benefits  Providers continue to profit from RD they simply
make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had
risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have

There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD
substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday
predictions of freemarket advocates would have been seen  restriction
of service lagging technological development etc  Likewise it appears
that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems where providers
are government agencies some of these negative impacts may occur
RD patients in the VA system in Spokane for example must travel to
Seattle  miles away for treatment

The bottom line however is that this is an example of government
intervention of a rather extreme sort that appears to have had beneficial
results for both providers and consumers  Claims that government
bureaucracy inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace
should take such such cases into account

	Well the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the
	Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for
	stopping withholding et cetera have been out there for a
	while now

Humbug  Those letters don't provide concrete proof of anything at all
in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu
ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations

Specifically show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that
income tax is illegal andor that ordinary working types do not have to
pay income tax and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with
out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness  This
issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect
something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court in the case of
federal tax or a state's supreme court for a state's income tax

Unless you can do that I for one am unwilling to call your material
concrete proof

	There has been no refutation to date  Have the naysayers
	finally given up as defeated  Sure would like to hear their
	reasons for disbelief at this point

Refutation  Refutation of what  You haven't made a case yet  You've
posted plenty of claims but you haven't given us any valid reason to
believe that any court in the US will agree with you  Your claims seem
on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I
feel the burden of proof is still on you to show that your arguments
have any merit whatsoever  And the cases you've cited involve such
strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are
applicable to anyone else or that they will ultimately stand on appeal
to the Supreme Court

Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe a regular
employee earning regular wages from a regular company refuses to pay
his income tax gets hauled into court is convicted of wilful tax eva
sion and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court
with a landmark  majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally
voluntary  What you say  No such case exists  Hmmm I wonder why
not why haven't you

	Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the
	opposition has forfeited the field

With all due respect you can conclude anything you want  I just hope
for your own sake that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of
authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit
ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions

For that matter I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to why you would
be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway  since I thought you
told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big
banking interests since the  admiralty jurisdiction coverup thing
Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble
to subvert the system and yet would still promptly slink back into
their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right
combination of magic spells and mystic mumbojumbo

Not only that but why do you even care what the US courts say anyway
Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US
officials to classify you as a th Amendment federal citizen  When
the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion why don't you just tell
them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington
DC where they belong

Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law which you
suggested would be better than all these statutes codes and the like
If you want to renounce society's legal framework fine we can just
declare you an outlaw OK and anyone who sees you driving on the roads
with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet
can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper with
plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 

Sorry everyone it's getting late and I'm sick and tired of all this
garbage  If I know what's good for me I'll just clam up and stop try
ing to refute this nonsense and if anyone falls for it and winds up in
jail for tax evasion or whatnot it'll be on their own head

Needless to say none of the above represents the opinions of my current
employer  who in any case is a Canadian and doesn't really need to
care too much about US tax law  I on the other hand am a th Amend
ment federal citizen with a US passport to prove it and plan to keep
on filing Form 's for the foreseeable future though I will probably
not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion
andor the foreign tax credit

Robert L McMillin rants
 The left likes to dodge the issues of morality and behavior crying that
 anyone who raises them blames the victim  Nonetheless as a recent
 editorial in the Los Angeles Times pointed out the free love
 advocates of the 's have demolished the poor  It's one thing to
 have children out of wedlock if you're say Murphy Brown or someone
 like her turning over a six figure salary  and quite another if
 you're sixteen have no skills and no income

And how did the free love advocates of the 's manage to perform
this demolitionforced breeding programs or something

 By accepting and even celebrating single outofwedlock parenthood the
 's radicals espousing free love set the stage for catastrophe among
 the poor They must account for this

Now let me get this straight  After a nice long rant about how
people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and
social lives all of a sudden 's radicals such as me I guess
are responsible for poor people's lifestyles  Tell me how that
worksor do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think
for themselves

There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and
support systems in general among this nation's poor  Somehow I
don't think Murphy Brownor Janis Joplinis at the top of any
sane person's list

You want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for
a lasting change for the worse try socalled relevant or values
education  Hey it seemed like a good idea at the time  How were
we to know you needed a real education firstI mean we took that
for granted

     Plug this one in I'm a Conservative I hate PeeCee's although I
have to use one at work and am a proud owner of a NeXT Station

The real question Should the Feds bailout Steve Jobs  NeXT a la Chrysler
so that important manufacturing jobs wouldn't be lost


You have just reminded me of an old Tom Paxton song

IM CHANGING MY NAME TO CHRYSLER
Tom Paxton 

Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight
What the dollar used to get us
Now won't buy a head of lettus
No the economic forecast isn't right
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray
I caneven glimpse a new and better way
And I've devised a plan of action
Worked it down to the last fraction
And I'm going into action here today

Chorus

  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am going down to Washington DC
  I will tell some power broker
  What they did for Iacoca
  Will be perfectly acceptable to me
  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am heading for that great receiving line
  So when they hand a million grand out
  I'll be standing with my hand out
  Yes sir I'll get mine

When my creditors are screaming for their dough
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can go
They won'y have to scream and holler
They'll all be paid to the last dollar
Where the endless streams of money seam to flow
I'll be glad to tell them all what they can do
Its just a matter of a simple form or two
It's not renumeration it's a liberal education
Ain't you kind of glad that I'm in debt to you

Chorus

Since the first first amphibians crawled out of the slime
We've been struggling in an unrelenting climb
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking
And it's sad failure is an awful crime
It's been that way for a millennium or two
But now it seems there's a different point of view
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic
Down in congress there is a safety net for you

Chorus



Perhaps Steven Jobs should take Paxton's advice and change his name to
Chrysler or perhaps set himself up as an SL maybe Neil Bush could
give him a hand

 DISCLAIMER  All opinions here belong to my cat and no one else

Yes it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around

It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries Japan Germany etc with
free defense and then tradewarring with them because of the economic
competition  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke

I ask myself what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid frivilous things with OUR money  Then I think the Constitution
was supposed to do that  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries  Seriously

  An Israeli soldier stabbed in the neck was lightly injured Soldiers

A soldier is attacked and his attacker is killed  What is the problem
here  Would your opinion be any different if the soldiers wounds were
more severe  How about if his attacker was only crippled for life
instead of being killed  I suspect that any Army would reprimand
soldiers who shot to injure rather than kill  Another lesson here

You are really sick my friend  The problem is that YOU PEOPLE do not have
any respect for human lives or civil laws where nonJews are concerned

If you don't see anything wrong with EIGHT soldiers walking up to a naked
man bound and gaged and firing point blank into his head it is clear why
antisemites exist

	A poster attempts to discuss an event rationally with no indication
at all that he is identified with any specific ethnic group  he is merely
talking in terms that might apply to ANY group in similar circumstances

	Schmidling comes back with a rabid attack against YOU PEOPLE as if
it were crystal clear that the Jewish people as a whole were culpable for this
man's statements  even if he were not Jewish Jack considers the Jewish people
to be responsible for all the acts of the supporters of Israel irrespective of
their age religion gender skin color or sexual orientation



There is nothing crystal clear about YOU PEOPLE other than a term
that includes those people defined by the statement that anyone who

There is something that bothers me about this whole arguement


 Could someone please CALMLY explain why homosexuality is such a great sin
   Without giving the standard Just because God sez so Almost all of Judeo



Thanks for your posting I enjoyed it

The reason Homosexuality is a sin is because the Jews were a struggling
group of people trying hard to survive and differentiate between
themselves and their oppressors  This led to several things

 Worshipping one god  All their foes were polytheistic

 All sex was put in to a moral context  All their foes were perverts
   and spilled their seed liberally

It's just as easy to spill seed or spread it thin heterosexualy why then
the specific prohibition on homosexuals especially since the answer to
everything back then was stoning to death doesn't help population growth
much Also to just say that their foes were perverts begs the question

The key word is spilled'  If semen was spilled anywhere where there
was a chance of procreation it was OK  If it was spilt on the ground or
in to a man it was a big sin ditto with animals The jews said sexpro
creation

Homosexuals didn't breed there fore they are evil and should be stoned
to death



 All sex was directed towards breeding  The jews were few in number
   and their foes many  To survive everything had to go into multiplication

Like I said stoning to death doesn't help population much It sounds more
like a set of prejudices that already existed and were blown into a religion
to emphasize the differences of Jewish culture and enshrine some pretty


Stoning nonbreeding population was fine  Only the breeders were
considered to be worth much

    Jesus  Judaism  original prejudiced Bullshit

I'll buy the bullshit He was a profound misogynist as well He might have
been bitterly gay himself No record of marriage

From crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer

 The homosexuals have gotten a law passed in California that
makes it illegal to discriminate against a person in employment
based on their sexual orientation  and not defined sexual
orientation  Pedophilia is a sexual orientation







GOT HIM  Cramer is now claiming that pedophilia is a sexual orientation
rather than a chronicly homosexual condition  This changes the whole
argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all
of its own peds cannot be called homosexual  Peds are peds who
may have a preference as to the sex of the child they molest though
most do not have a preference but that is a subset of their basic
ped nature

Cramer has as much as admitted that peds and gay men are different
orientations  All we need now is to get him to admit that
the apparent similarities he keeps on about are just optical illusions

Kaldis you are a worm

 Rank balderdash  America's reputation abroad has become tarnished
 because of feckless and pusillanimous cowards who apparently do not
 have the requisite gonads to stand up for American honor and dignity

Translation  It's them DAMN liberals again

 The American Way may not be the only way and you may not consider it
 to be necessarily the best way but by God it's OUR way and we're
 going to stick with it  If you can't go along with the program then
 perhaps you should consider moving elsewhere

Who gave you the authority to create and enforce this rather
hazy thing called the American Way  This is a democracy and
we don't need to stick to it or stick up for it unless we so
choose  Remember that Ted from Civics class in Greeley CO

 That is exactly the PROBLEM with Canadians  They don't stand for
 anything with certitude

Nice generalization

 You pipsqueak  You mouse  If you are sorry to intrude then why do
 it  Don't you have the courage of your convictions  Hell do you
 even have any convictions to start with  What kind of example of
 manly dignity is this  Sheesh

Coming from such a crass example of manly dignity he must
feel really hurt

 I like the way people call it cruel and unusual punishment as if
 imprisonment isn't cruel too  Lethal injection pales in comparison
 And they have a death sentence because they were convicted of a cruel
 and unusual crime

It's not what they did that matters  It's what you do and
what I do and what we do in response that matters  Do we
lessen ourselves by killing in response to killing  It's
vengeance  That's all  It's no deterrent  It serves no
purpose but to slake somebody's blood lust

 It would be nice though if we never convicted someone of a crime they
 didn't commit and it would make the death penalty much more justifiable

Yeah yeah yeah and sure would be nice if we didn't apply the
death penalty disproportionately to minorities  I'll revisit my
opinion on the death penalty when there are more whites up for
it than blacks  Ie when hell freezes over

Jack I happen to be Jewish and have some serious problems with the whole
situation in Israel But your exaggerations and commentary certainly don't help
to support your viewpoint Here for example you are conflating two separate
stories and exaggerating both of them

If I have confused two different stories it was an honest mistake but I do
not see why it becomes an exageration of either  They both took place and
are both equally disgusting behavior for any country let alone one that
brags constantly about democracy

If more of YOU PEOPLE would speak out instead of just hiding your disgust
in the closet  we wouldn't be having this discussion

Having said you have my heartfelt thanks and admiration for even saying
what you have said already  I suspect you will be getting more  hate
mail than support

Thanks

 Here is a press release from the California Department of Insurance

  California Insurance Commissioner Endorses Federal Legislation to
 Protect Consumers from Scam Insurance Companies

I may be a little dense but I would have thought that protecting consumers
from scam insurance companies would be the prime objective of something
called the Cal insurance Commission If they aren't accomplishing that now
then why do we need them

Very simple  An 'Insurance Commissioner' is a bureaucrat  a regulator
It is hisher duties to make rules to enforce laws  Heshe cannot
make laws  If there is no law that covers a specific subject say
scam insurance companies a regulator cannot create one  So they have
to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted  For
the California Insurance Commissioner there are two possible legislative
bodies  the California State Legislature and the US Congress  We all
know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes esp
along the lines of insurance reform legislation negative movement  So
Garamendi wants the feds to do it because a he has a better chance
of getting a federal law through and b since many of the scam
companies work across state linesnational borders it is better to
have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions

Last night I heard something about Bill Clinton's sister being
involved in a marijuana bust and the news being suppressed I also
heard something about her being an excon This source is not
reliable though It was a collagebooklet advertising a local band

Can anyone on the net verify this or provide more details I'm
surprised I haven't seen anything about this in this newsgroup

Also does anyone know what happened to the charges that Shalala was a
regular pot smoker when she was in college This ghastly accusation
was reported on CNN Streamline News the day she was nominated then I
never heard anything about it again

It's almost enough to make me want to start an ActUp type campaign
to invade the privacy of closet smokers If only this type of
publicity didn't violate people's rights

In article Marpmafireinelgov
cdmpmafireinelgov Dale Cook said

 A real world data point A person has a much stronger legal claim for
 harrassment sexual or otherwise if they make it clear to the
 offender that their behaviour is unwanted  If the behaviour persists
 harrassment is much easier to demonstrate due to the fact that the
 offender knew that the behaviour was unwanted

No argument here my original query regarded the question of why the
first sexual proposition made by Person A to Person B would be
considered to be sexual harassment by somemany people  Assuming of
course that there does not exist a power relationship between A and B
such that the proposition carries strong implications of extortion right
from Word One

I can only say that those people are wrong The word harass means to
irritate or torment persistently I'd hardly consider one time to fall
under the definition of persistent  Additionally there is no basis
to assume the behaviour is unwanted unlike an illegal proposition

 Of course I think the original question of offering money for sex is
 inarguably harrassment because the activity is illegal and could be
 presumed to be unwanted by the average citizen

I have to take issue with this viewpoint given that a prostitution
is a victimless crime and b there are literally millions of Americans
who participate in some sort of victimless activities which the state
has defined to be criminal eg prostitution obscenity gambling
using certain recreational drugs having nonmercenary sex with persons
not one's spouse in certain states having unnatural sex with people
regardless of marital status or exchange of money in certain states
etc I'd have to say that the idea that an activity may be presumed to
be unwanted by the average citizen merely because it is illegal is the
sort of sophistry that only a judge could indulge in with a straight
face  He said speaking as a law student who's read his share of
judicial opinions in which reality was not only denied but in fact
actually inverted in order to make the universe conform to the writer's
politics

I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint  What you say is true but
the law in order to make what little sense it manages to make has to
make some assumptions  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted
by the average citizen I think is reasonable  Certainly I would need
a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there
was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome

The number of people who participate in victimless crimes notwithstanding
the fact reamins that under the law the activity is illegal  To presume
that the proposition is welcome simply because a large number of people
indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in
with a straight face

   With a tip of the hat to David Letterman for making the Top Ten format
    so popular
 
 Top Ten Reasons that Conservatives don't want to aid Russia

 looking around  Who  Where
 Don't look at me  I want to send aid to Russia  Many other
 conservatives do as well

Yes it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around

Enemy  Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked
conservative  'always been commies always will be'  I suggest you
listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying
and compare that with the very antiWest slogans coming from his
opponents in the Russian congress  I sure know who I want to back

Oh BTW Germany has sure come back as a terrible enemy after WWII
hasn't it

It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries Japan Germany etc with
free defense and then tradewarring with them because of the economic
competition  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke

Better to let them degenerate into civil war  Remember all those
nuclear weapons in Russia  I cannot imagine that they would not
be used in a civil war  If nationialists take over and even if
they prevent a civil war most feel they must take back large
parts of land that are in other countries like Ukraine  I also cannot
imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight possibly nuclear

How does this affect us  Well we are on the same planet and if
vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something
A massive breakup of a country that spans th the planet is
bound to have affects here  Of course there is also the
humanitarian argument that democracies should help other
democracies or struggling democracies


I ask myself what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid frivilous things with OUR money  Then I think the Constitution
was supposed to do that  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries  Seriously

Seriously  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid
My two causes are aid to Russia and a strong space program
Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies
of drunken goldfish  That is why we have a republic and not a
true democracy  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale we
only have gridlock on a congressional scale

BTW who is to decide 'stupid'  This is just like those who
want to impose their 'morals' on others  just the sort of
thing I thought Libertarians were against

Actually my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue
and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party  It seems
that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and
let it sink or swim  We could do that  years ago but not now
Like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and
global decision making

      I think the dialogue would go better if at least some gays
 showed awareness of a practical issue  For example men and women use
 different toilets  Hence men who are likely to abuse girls have that
 avenue closed to them  There are many other situations where it is easy
 to prevent sexual abuse BETWEEN the two sexes through such measures and
 social conventions  It is harder to prevent it with gays but if those
 gays who do not abuse children nor want to became aware that this is
 a practical problem that we can solve with good will on both sides then
 we can have protection for parents and children at the same time as
 protection for gays in those ways that are of importance to their
 pursuit of happiness in their own way
 
 Just a thought
 
 Rohit Parikh
 
 Sorry Rohit but you are responding to someone wellrecognized as a
 flaming nut ie Clayton Cramer He must have been abused by a man and is
 living his life in an attempt to vilify all men who like sex with other men
 something slightly similar to the way his assailant liked it with him He
 will alter or misrepresent anything he finds to try to prove that there are
 homosexuals who wish to rape little boys like he was coming out of the
 woodwork There is no hope for him In all probability he is secretly gay
 which compounds his neurosis in his own mind by thinking that someone else
 made him that way I don't personally see how someone like him could walk
 and chew gum at the same time as mentally crippled and dominated as he is
 by his fantasies

 He would have you believe that the figures on the percentage of people who
 like to do it with the same sex sometime or all the time is way smaller
 than it is but then he will virtually assert that everyone's queer and
 they're trying to get him He actually believes despite all evidence that
 homosexuals do some huge disproportionate amount of child sexual abuse
 even though he insists that there may be as few as  of them in the male
 population If there were that few of them in the population San Francisco
 would currently be empty because a significant portion of them have sought
 a tolerant atmosphere in that city and the numbers simply do not work when
 you add up their home town origins There is nothing to be gained by
 communicating with Clayton Cramer he is unable to listen to anyone

   Maple Street     Without safe and free abortion women are   
  Santa Cruz CA     organsurrogates to unwanted parasites   
  Real Men would never accept organslavery and will protect Women  

Sorry but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted

Unless I am badly mistaken Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys
from men is different than protecting girls from men There are situations
in which boys and girls are apart from members of the opposite sex
due to social convention or whatever and thus are safe in at least
some sense These same situations don't necessarily protect the
children from abuse by members of the same sex

If we can understand that it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest
that if we all think about it hard someone may come up with a
practical solution or even a partial solution to some of the situations
in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse
them By working together with good will on both sides we may be
able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms

Mr Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for
personal attacks on Mr Cramer While Mr Walz hasn't by a long
stretch been the only one to flame Mr Cramer it is no less childish
and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the
future

I agree mostly with Chris  It is unfortunately IMO true that the FBI
figures for rape based on the 'uniform crime report' report only female
rapes However some states such as Illinois are not tabluated because they
refuse to comply with this sexist definition

Yeah right  I guess the next time a homosexual complains about
sodomy laws I can just echo your stupidity about democratic
processes and he won't have any basis for complaint

 I must admit that I never understood why it is referred to as an

 evidence that homosexuality is a response to child molestation 
 which is disproportionately done by homosexuals  Just to make
 Brian Kane happy   of molestation is done by homosexuals and
 bisexuals but it is possible that this is because homosexualbisexual
 molesters have far more victims than heterosexual molesters

 No it isn't  No it isn't No it isn't and it depends on the subset

  I thought I was clear  Because homosexuals support laws to force

  adults

    Ok I'll leave others to discuss your use of statistics but I think I'm
 able to discuss liberterian ideas
    The ideas are good They seek to maximise individual rights by keeping
 governments out of transactions between consenting adults If an employer wants
 to discriminate against a group shehe should be allowed to to maximise their
 freedom The discriminatees can go elsewhere
    Unfortunately it doesn't relate to maximising total individual rights
 within a community If an employer or shopkeeper or whatever can discriminate
 in this way then the freedom of the discriminatee goes down Because people do
 not live in perfect economic conditions with perfect mobility unlimited
 numbers of potential employers of their skills unlimited places to buy goods
 the liberterian argument leads to a decrease in the amount of liberty in the
 community

You mean if a large part of the population supports discrimination
against homosexuals they will be injured  But if a large part of the
population supports such discrimination how did that law get passed

There may be some confusion here  The Uniform Crime Reports program
run by the FBI defines rape as a female victim only crime  even
though some states have the laws desexed  I suspect that this causes
male victims of rape to be left out of the UCR data

 You give them a fair look  You decide that you don't want to hire
 the guy wearing the NAMBLA Tshirt  He files a lawsuit  You lose
 Yes such laws force you to hire homosexuals

 Pedophiles as well

Sexual orientation is not defined by the antidiscrimination law
that was passed last year  Pedophilia isn't a sexual orientation

 And Cramer let me describe how you'd have it and see if this is
 accurate  I apply for a job at a computer company  They see I'm
 wearing some article of homosexual adornment I dunno maybe a
 Silence  Death pin or something  They turn me down because of
 that  I can't do a darned thing and have to go look somewhere else
 Am I correct in assuming that you wholeheartedly approve of the
 company's actions or at least that you wholeheartedly support their
 right to take that action

I wholeheartedly support their right to take this action  I wouldn't
do it myself unless it was something like the NAMBLA Tshirt

 How about  a black man applies for a job at a bank  The bank decides
 based on statistics a black person would be more likely to steal
 money and denies the man the job  Would you support the bank's right
 to this freedom  If not explain how this differs

I support their right to do so just like I support your right to
engage in sodomy with consenting adults but I think they are doing
something wrong  I wouldn't do business with such a bank

 Clayton has repeatedly said that California's statutes classify
 pedophilia as a sexual orientation and that discriminating on the
 basis of sexual orientation is illegal

 If true I'm frankly amazed  But I don't trust Clayton to give me
 the whole story  Would someone clarify for me whether this is true
 what sort of discrimination Clayton's talking about jobs housing
 hate crimes and whether the effect of the law is really that
 a daycare has to hire an admitted pedophile

 ha ha ha oh Clayton you're so good so consistent so predictable
 yup that's right they these homosexual people want to FORCE you to
 ignore what's none of your fucking business  IE I will explain slowly
 their sexual orientation should be irrelevant as irrelevant as their
 gender skin colour religious affiliation attitude to handgun ownership
 etc  They want to FORCE you to hire the best person for the job rent the
 accomodation to the person who will look after it do business with whoever
 will make you money

Yet when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this
philosophy to cigarette smokers so that people who smoked away
from the work couldn't be discriminated against by employers
the liberal Gov Wilder vetoed it  Which shows that liberals don't
give a damn about best person for the job it's just a power
play

 Slavery makes economic sense it NEVER makes MORAL sense when human
 muscle power is an economically valuable asset Agricultural slavery might
 have lasted right up to the first mechanical cotton reaper but no
 further reapers are cheaper than slaves and don't have to be fed during
 the winter

 This argument makes a several fundamental errors  First agricultural
 slavery was not limited to production of cotton  In the American south
 slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco sugar and rice all
 of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the th century

And of course in states like Kentucky and Virginia not wellsuited to
largescale plantations slave labor was used to make one of the most
valuable agricultural products of all more slaves  In some ways this
treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying
aspect of American slavery

 Second although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to
 reduce the demands for labor eventually it was only in the 's
 the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated
 the labor intensive character of the operation long after the first
 mechanical cotton reaper was invented

This is an interesting question  Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath
published in the s uses agricultural mechanization of cotton
production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted
from the land  How many years were involved in the mechanization of
cotton farming  When did this first appear

  labor is a tough one Labor is defined economically as the efforts
  both mental and physical of humans Capital is defined as intermediate
  goods used to create other goods and services Now if a slave is considered
  an intermediate good then the slave has now been dehumanized and is
  simply a machine Not good for the antislave ie prohuman rights
  argument So slaves are humans and they produce labor

 Sorry  The question of defining slave labor is no tougher than
 defining the labor of a horse an ox or any other livestock  Both
 legally and economically in a slaveeconomy slaves are NOT humans
 they are livestock

Can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as
not humans  They were outside our society and similar phrases that
basically meant that they didn't have to recognized as having the same
rights as a free person but they were never considered not human to
my knowledge

 Like a horse that pulls a plow a slave's labor is the return on the
 capital required to purchase and feed him  The parallel is so obvious
 I'm not sure how you missed it  After all its was the liberty to
 use their property as they saw fit that motivated Southern planters
 to emphasize the importance of states' rights

If that were the case the slave states would not have passed so many
laws that restricted the freedom of slave owners to do as they wished
with their property  Examples laws prohibiting manumission without
legislative grant laws prohibiting teaching slaves to read  write

 The argument that slavery was a dying institution was often made by
 						     
 						     IS

 historians mainly Southerners who sought to divert attention from the
 institution as the central issue of the Civil War  In fact however
 the argument is specious at best  More recent scholarship from the
 last  years demonstrates rather conclusively that the cottonsugar
 tobacco economy and its reliance on slavery was increasingly dominant in
 the South prior to the Civil War

 This is because the South did not receive the massive momentum of capital
  intensive growth that the Northern states did Compare the Northern
  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference
  in the capital to labor intensity

Capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy  Except that
capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did

Slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin yes but not
in 

 It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 's 
 the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the
 South

 That is not the argument that I have heard It would not have lasted because
  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without
  spilling over to the Southern states ie Northern industry would have
  migrated capital to the Southern states and with that would have come
  immigrant labor to the ports of the South eg Charleston Savannah Mobile
  New Orleans etc This would have put the breaks on the slave market and
  slavery would have been outmoded by the capital intensity of competing
  agriculturalists Those that insisted on keeping slaves because of their
  Cruel Hearts and Hatred for Black People would have been driven out of
  business Simple capital to labor ratioread Michael Parkin Microeconomics
  nd edition and any other basic economics book

This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments
would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the
North  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else
to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery I do not doubt
that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive
threat  Thomas Sowell's Market and Minorities argues that the
maintenance of slavery and the costs it imposed on state and local
governments discouraged not only capital formation but also outside
capital investment in the Southern states

Furthermore what are the specific charges against the four LAPD officers
Which civil rights or laws are they accused of violating

I believe it is a general charge that is no specific right is mentioned


I don't think that this is accurate I believe and could be wrong that
there IS a specific right allegedly to have been violated like the
th or due process or whatever

What about double jeopardy Has there been any concern that a verdict
against Koon et al might be overturned upon appeal because they're being tried
again for the same actions I thought I heard something on the news about
this

The SS has previously ruled that since the seperate governments were in
essence seperate sovereigns then double jeopardy does not apply

If this is true then could defendents also be tried under city and
county governments

This mornings paper said that the ACLU has decided to reinstate its
opposition to this kind of thing They had earlier suspended their
opposition while they examined the King case There might be hope
for the ACLU after all


Double jeopardy does not apply but not for the reasons you quote Double
jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge
However the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force
or assault They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating
Mr King's civil rights

AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once
it most likely will not happen This is because cities and states
have separate laws governing behaviour For example in some states
it is an offence to carry marijuana but not a city offence Also
I think murder is against federal but not some state laws


            
        
                       And my mind was filled with wonder
                   when the evening headlines read
                          'Richard Cory went home last night
                           and put a bullet through his head'

 Some people are not very good at getting the best deal for their
 effort and others are unwilling to put forth much effort even in
 the face of economic incentives There will always be some people
 who are stupid or lazy relative to the ability or effort of most
 others The question is what do you do with them There are three
 options
 
  Kill those who are not productive as a drain upon society
    This is the communist All who do not toil shall not eat 
    Lenin or fascist approach
 

    You're being too generous to the communists I think  In practice
communism has solved the problem by killing off anybody who is too
productive and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the
rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards  The mass butchery of kulaks
in the USSR is a good instance of this
    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which
people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee  I often wonder
just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would
have been forced to remain in Cuba  Would they have revolted and killed
him off or been killed
    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in
load it up so heavily with attack dogs barbed wire and land mines that
most people fleeing over it die and then give everyone the choice of
obedience prison or flight  This would be a bad sciencefiction novel
if the East Germans hadn't actually done it  The last person to die
crossing the wall as I recall was an unarmed woman who was shot in the
back  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that but he fled to
socialists in Chile
    It's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents but sometimes
it's a sheer waste of time

	Remember the eighties  No excuses Nobody who can handle a mail
buffer can claim they are too young to remember Ronald Reagan  yet
The eighties were about How America Learned to Win Once Again Then
wouldn't you know we won so well that there was nothing left to win
No Cold War to endure No nuclear holocaust No more worlds to conquer
We forgot about outer space long ago The kind of overwhelming no
holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great Yes there were a
few little problems along the way  stock market meltdown here an
SL bailout there a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to
contend with but as Tacitus would tell ya' the God Augustus never had
it so good

	In the meantime there is guilt for winning maybe a fear that one
doesn't deserve one's bounty  or success So there is a kinder and gentler
type of politician these days Bill Clinton affirmative action and lots of
discourse about people who don't get it For those of us in the winning
business this kind of talk is mildly irritating but there is still no
suggestion of losing

	But what do we find now  To put it mildy the stereotype of our
white male nonwinner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl punching out
photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one
with a Hail Mary pass in the Fourth Quarter The whole idea behind 'three
yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses
in the final period But Woody just used his fists  Uzzies seem to be the
weapon of choice these days

	Who is DFENS anyway  The answer is as plain as the horn rims on
your face The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS posing as a LOSER This
is known as controversial casting But that baggy shortsleeved white shirt
sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it Gordon Gekko will never look the
same Though Woody always dressed that way Did we really expect Gekko to
take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe without putting up a fuss 

	What we are starting to lose sight of is that bashing DFENS is
the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood
used to blow away all the time As that archWASP male gender George C Scott
declaimed Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN They love a winner and will
not tolerate a loser And so on

	The political implications are simple If as many socialists  and
Democrats  do you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some
equitable way then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a
loser to tell whose side you are on That could be black women today Asian
homosexuals tommorrow and yes indeed white men some yet to be determined
day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that 
minority

	Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say  as do most
conservatives and all the libertarians  and act is if you didn't care
who's winning and who's losing In some cases you might say something
about make sure the game is fair equality of opportunity not of condition
In the latter case you might be able to identify yourself as a
neoconservative or a neoliberal depending on how much you want to limit
the pot

	Either way you go the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be
popular  at least after you graduate from High School but you'll still
be popular at High School reunions But it beats being a Nerd as I
would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree and in the long run it
is the only way to go Even in Hollywood which treats Losers worse than any
other place in America except for New York and Washington DC  and even in
Columbus Ohio which produced Alex Keaton but no champion football teams in
the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties I'd like to
see more Winners in this society regardless of race gender religious
preference and sexual orientation Maybe we should even let a few more of
them be white men  We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl
someday

If someone beats up a homosexual he should get charged for assault and
battery  Why must we add gay bashing to the list  Isn't this a sort of
double jeopardy  Or am I just being a fascist again

 To deter an epidemic of gay bashing that has not been deterred by
   assault laws

So we ought to make beating up a homosexual more illegal than beating up a
straight

And who's advocating that  Hate crimes laws are aimed at the motivations
of the acts  Just like premeditated homicide is treated stricter than
heatofpassion homicide

 No it is not double jeopardy  A single act may lead to multiple
   charges and multiple crimes

I think what you meant to say here was With the current mutation of the US
Constitution under the current police state someone may be charged multiple
times for one act if the victim in question is of the right shade  A single
act should never merit more than on charge

So if I set off a bomb in the World Trade Center I can only be charged with
more than one murder and not the other five deaths and extensive property
damage  After all the bomb was a single act

Glad to see that you agree that the current Government is reticent

I demanded that the DA prove such jurisdiction on the record and the
DA stood mute  I have also had an appellate court uphold such action
and hide behind California Rules of Court Rule  The judges of
the appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in
any cases decided by them but may do so whenever they deem it

	The title is selfexplanatory Isaac Asimov once pointed out
that curious fact

Well since tax evasion is illegal one generally would not bother to
consider whether it was unpatriotic or not  How often does one think
of murder as being unpatriotic

Perhaps a more appropriate question would be why is tax avoidance not
considered unpatriotic  The answer to this is simple  Tax avoidance
is simply defined as paying the minimum tax you are legally obligated to
pay

There is a deeper reason Taxes  by their very nature are unAmerican
One need only look at the birth and history of the US to see this fact

Wasn't the beef with the English over taxation WITHOUT REPRESENTATION
not taxation itself

From my admittedly dim recollection of US history most of the problems
we Americans have had with taxes have been with unfairunjust taxation
schemes not with taxes themselves  It's pretty hard to run a government
without any means of support

RF   REVIEW ARTICLE  REFS

Why isn't this information in the FAQ on marijuana     If we expect
people to think we are telling them the truth about drugs why does
this group constantly refute every negative thing about almost all
drugs

Maybe because the claims deserve refute  The above abstract lists various
possible links to cannabis use unfiltered almost guaranteed and lung
problems  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article but
without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered
their data it really doesn't tell you shit  I'm going to track down that
study hopefully tomarrow



I never claimed pot was more or less damageing than
cigarettesI was just trying to keep ourselves honest   If we are
going to educate kidsand adultsand tell them the truth about drugs
don't you think a much better approach would be to list the pro's and
con's of each type of drug

What justifies the truth about drugs  Research  What sort of
research  Correlational data can help establish a theory but it does not
prove anything

How can you expect someone to make a
decision when the PDFA on one hand says that all drugs are absolutely
BAD BAD BADand this newsgroup consistently refuses to admit that
drugs like heroin even have negative side effects

Heroin is a relatively safe drug  What makes it unsafe are IV administration
and shit like adulterants  There are side effects like withdrawal but they
effect people differently

I've seen numerous
posts claiming heroin has lower addiction rates that cigarettes which
might be true but it is very deceiving because heroin is much more
harmful drug to be addicted to than cigarettes   Heroin addicts are
far more prone to end up in the gutter and destroy their family and
friends than people addicted to just cigarettes

Stereotypical statement  I know people who use heroin and opiates that
function just fine in society

This group does
provide some very good information to people but I am worried that
the prolegalizationprodecriminalization movement is being hurt when
it refuses to admit that anysome drugs are VERY harmful

Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically


      I'm all for legalization of most drugs but when someone asks me
about relative risks of certain drugs or possible bad side effects I
would like to know themand not be given the runaround by this
groupwhich recently tried to tell me that pot was not harmful in
any manner to people's lungs

NO NO NO  or at least I haven't been arguing this  there is not enough
data to form a scientific conclusion  that doesn't mean that cannabis
is benign to users' lungs  we can form all the theories we want but they
are only theories  some theories are supported by more evidence than others
and that makes them stronger

I think it's time y'all reexamined
your positions and try to understand that you cannot fight the PDFA
by calling them a bunch of liars

the hell I can't  they state UNJUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS AS FACT as
a POLITICAL strategy to stop drug use



In general I somewhat see what you're saying  And people like Jack Herer
contribute to this  This has been quite a big mindfuck for me recently
and I've pretty came to the conclusion that you can't trust ANYBODY by
word of mouth alone  my attitude about the general population has
decreased significantly

    Does the greatly increased rates of incarceration amongst

    Isn't this a matter of demographics Doesn't this simply show
    that since criminal behaviour is common or apt to be common
    in the  insert your favorite correct numbers here year
    old range and since the percentage of blacks in this range is
    higher than in other groups then it follows statistically
    that more blacks in prison is an expected result
    
    Note that I haven't said anything about blacks being given
    stiffer or longer sentences than other groups I'm sure this
    has to have an effect on the issue of overrepresentation of
    blacks in prison

Blacks have the same   crime report rate arrest rate and incarceration
rate for violent crimes

So I doubt that for violent crimes that there is any inherent bias mechanism
present

There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to  categories

Interestingly enough the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern
United States  where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in
the rest of the United States Which points to an antibiasagainst wrt
blacks

In any case for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling blacks are
reported  arrested  and are present in jailsprisons  

Considering that  of the population is black  are black males and
some percentage of that is out of the highlow age groups we do have a
situation where if I remember my old calculations right  of the
population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes

Blacks with similar histories crime to whites get the same sentences
except in the South where they receive around  less on paper




There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of
environmental disaster Weird eh

These opinions are MINE and you can't have 'em But I'll rent 'em cheap

    Now let me get this straight After a nice long rant about
    how people need to take personal responsibility for their

    such as me I guess are responsible for poor people's
    lifestyles Tell me how that worksor do you think that poor
    people are just too dumb to think for themselves
    
    There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family

    relevant or values education Hey it seemed like a good
    idea at the time How were we to know you needed a real
    education firstI mean we took that for granted

The 's generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible

The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
kids would not want for anything  going overboard and creating a nation of
brats

Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 

Apollo  and Woodstock

Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
reverted to the cultural level of primitives defecation in public etc

And which group assembled took care of itself and dispersed with no damage
no deaths no large numbers of drug problems

like that  My income is small because I'm still a student so my tax
               
percentages could be a little off but  You can afford  or even 
of a  per year income leaving you with guess you can't
afford that new sterio system along with everyone else in the country
so that everyone can have access to decent health care including you
when you lose your job and couldn't afford it if you had to pay for it
all yourself since you can't get as much money back for that  sterio
system as you paid for it
NOTE I don't have any exact figures on the proposed healthcare package
so please don't assume that it would be  of your income as that was not
my point  That was approximate total tax not tax for one thing


Boy is this guy in for a shock when he hits the real world  Our tax rate
is incredibly high higher than many European countries  it is just
packaged differently income Social inSecurity Medicare payroll taxes
property taxes sales taxes fees mandatory disability insurance state

My apologies  Your right  I wasn't following the thread  But I think
most women are tougher than that  I am suprised that someone would

I don't have any stats  I seriously doubt that most abortions are done

  GovernmentMandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful Study Finds

  Washington DC  The energy tax and subsidized energyefficiency
  measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel
  O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions a new study from the Cato
  Institute points out

    According to Jerry Taylor Cato's director of natural resource studies
  we are not running out of sources of energy The world now has almost 
  times the proven oil reserves it had in  and twice the reserves of
   Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as
  dramatically

    When standards of living population densities and industrial
  structures are controlled for the United States is no less energy
  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group
  of Seven nations

    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil
  price shocks because the energy economy is global Moreover since the
  cost of oil represents only about  percent of gross national product
  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the
  overall US economy

    Market economies are on average  times more energy efficient per
   of GNP than are centrally planned economies

    Utilities' subsidized energyefficiency measurs known as demandside
  management programs encourage free riders overuse of competing resource
  inputs an competitive inequities Furthermore DSM programs do not
  reduce demand

    Taylor concludes that governmentmandated energy conservation imposes
  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes not conserves energy that
  subsidizing energyconservation technologies will stymie not advance
  gains in energy conservation and that central control over the lifeblood
  of modern societyenergywould transfer tremendous power to the state
  at the expense of the individual

    Energy Conservation and Efficiency The Case Against Coercion is no
   in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute an
  independent public policy research organization in Washington DC

                        The Cato Institute

    Founded in  the Cato Institute is a public policy research
  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate
  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the
  traditional American principles of limited government individual
  liberty and peace  To that end the Institute strives to achieve
  greater involvement of the intelligent concerned lay public in
  questions of policy and the proper role of government
    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters libertarian pamphlets
  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early th
  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation
  of the American Revolution
    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders today virtually
  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment  A pervasive
  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary
  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for
  civil liberties
    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive
  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy
  issues  Books monographs and shorter studies are commissioned
  to examine the federal budget Social Security regulation military
  spending international trade and myriad other issues  Major policy
  conferences are held throughout the year from which papers are
  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal
    In order to maintain its independence the Cato Institute accepts
  no government funding  Contributions are received from foundations
  corporations and individuals and other revenue is generated from
  the sale of publications  The Institute is a nonprofit taxexempt
  educational foundation under Section c of the Internal Revenue
  Code

SECRET PURPOSE OF FALKLANDS WAR  with INVISIBILITY Technology

Dr Beter AUDIO LETTER  of

This is the Dr Beter AUDIO LETTERR  K St NW Washington
DC  

   Hello my friends this is Dr Beter  Today is April 
 and this is my AUDIO LETTERR No 

  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South
Atlantic  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute
between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren windswept
Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island  In reality it's far
more than that

   The socalled Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a
giant military operation  During this month of April 
fierce naval battles have taken placenot only in the South
Atlantic but also in the South Pacific  Up to now most of the
hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on
all sides  But as I say these words the naval war in the
Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface

   Beginning today April  a total naval and air blockade of
the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun  At the same time a
counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area

   To be effective a blockade must be imposed over a period of
time but the Royal Navy does not have that much time  Winter is
coming on in the South Atlantic and the British supply lines are
overextended  Having come this far Her Majesty's navy cannot
simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time
without drawing blood from Argentina  As a result the British
will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no
matter how risky they may be

   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no
choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat  That
reason my friends is that the Royal Navy has already suffered
losses in secret combat this month  Up to this moment there will
be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by
the British fleet  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts
will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle
losses  To obtain that cover story the British have no choice
but to sail into combat but in doing so they will be risking
even heavier losses on top of those already sustained  In short
my friends Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap

   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange
ironic echoes of the past  For weeks now we've been hearing
countless commentators referring to the British task force as an
armada quote  The British of all people ought to be very
uneasy with that description  The original Spanish Armada 
years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force
but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it
changed the course of historyand it was none other than the
English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada

   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in  during the
reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I  The Armada was an invasion
fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England
They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake  Drake
and his small fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada
by changing the rules of battle  The English fleet was equipped
with new longerrange guns and it stayed upwind and out of
reach  From there the English pounded smashed and shattered
the big ships of the mighty Armada  When it was all over barely
half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port  Drake's
defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world  It opened
the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its
expansion into a truly global empire

   Today  years later history seems to have come full
circle  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the
world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I and now
the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in
confrontation  Once again a socalled armada is preparing for
invasion but this time the armada is British not Spanish  Four
hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day
today the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene

   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake
Passage around the southern tip of South America  The defeat of
the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's
naval supremacy and now the defeat of the new British armada may
well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal
Navy

   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are

Topic THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND
Topic THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
Topic THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR

Topic When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month
it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot  For a century and
a half since  the Islands have been controlled by Great
Britain  During that entire time British sovereignty over the
Falklands has been disputed by Argentina  There have been
countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands which it
calls the Malvinas but the threats have always come to nothing
in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about
them

   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba
is from the United States and they are not much of a prize
After  years of occupancy the Falklands are home to fewer
than  British settlers and a lot of sheep  In short the
remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over
and yet here we are watching another crisis take place  We are
watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina

   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all
about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's
doorstep  Instead Britain is throwing almost everything it's
got at Argentinaaircraft carriers cruisers destroyers
submarines assault shipsyou name it  Luxury cruise ships have
even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight
Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated
and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed  Ships and
submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and
sent to reinforce the task force  The initial ship force has
grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada
numbering over   Over twothirds of the entire Royal Navy has
already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina

   Watching all this a lot of people are asking What's this
fight really all about  The most popular answer suggested in the
major media is oil  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist
under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands
but that has been known for nearly  years  In no way does it
explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina
this month and oil explains even less about the Argentine
seizure of South Georgia Island

   South Georgia Island is  miles east of the Falklands with
no known oil deposits anywhere near it and compared to South
Georgia the Falklands are an island paradise  South Georgia
Island is covered with rugged mountains treacherous valleys
glaciers and semipermanent snow  Most of it is uninhabitable
On top of all that Argentina has absolutely no legal or
historical claim to South Georgia Island  In that respect it
stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands

   In the early s the Falklands were occupied for a while by
Argentine colonists  In  the British expelled them and took
over the Island  For that and other historical reasons
Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina
not Britain

   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island  It
has always been controlled by Britain never by Argentina or
Spain  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even
more unreasonable from a military point of view  Argentina's
leaders are military men and they think in military terms  They
were well aware ahead of time that faroff South Georgia Island
could not possibly be held for long  By seizing it they were
setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat as the Island
was retaken by Britain  So the question is Why did Argentina's
military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia
Island at all

   My friends the answers to all these questions are military
not political or economic  South Georgia Island possesses an
enormous military secret  It's a giant underground installation
buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island
The real reason for the socalled Falkland crisis is this secret
installation together with two other similar installations which
I will describe shortly

   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many
years they are not new  What is new is the accelerated nuclear
war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in
Washington  For the past two months I've been reporting the
details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain
and verify them

   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of
this year   It is this fastapproaching nuclear war threat
that caused the socalled Falklands crisis to erupt now

   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of
the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war  The
mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks herenamely the
Rockefeller carteland Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are
behind the present crisis  They are trying to ruin Phase  of
the PROJECT Z war plan which I revealed last month  That phase
is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both
Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR
ONE  As I mentioned last month the key to this plan is the
existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around
the world

   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are
working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of
other countries to set off war  Having done that they intend to
ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused safe and cozy in
Government war bunkers  When the warring nations finally lie
smoldering and exhausted the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered
remains of their host countries  They will rendezvous at the
secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the
open  They will confront the world with the only remaining
fresh uptodate powerful military force on earth and using
that military power they will become the undisputed rulers of
the worldthat is they plan to do all this and they plan to
pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off
NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months  The Rockefeller cartel
and Russia's new antiBolshevik rulers are working together in a
race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan

   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are
benefitting from war preparations which were started by the
Rockefellers long ago  It has only been about three years since
the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United
States Government by the Bolsheviks  Since that time the United
States Government has been a house divided torn by internal
power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions
But before that the United States had been dominated for decades
both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller
Brothers

   In  the Brothers launched a new longrange plan for world
domination  It was a twoprong strategy half visible and half
secret which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No 
It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret
while appearing to disarm gradually  Without repeating all the
details the basic idea was grandiose yet simple  By
deliberately appearing weak the Rockefellercontrolled United
States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia
Then the secret weapons including superweapons would be
unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world

   When they set the grand plan in motion in  the
Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the
late s  Their military analysts concluded very early that
the war being planned would have very different effects on the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres  Both superpowers the United
States and the Soviet Union are located well up in the Northern
Hemisphere so are the other fullfledged nuclear powersGreat
Britain France Red China and India  By contrast the
strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are
relatively few and far between  In other words it was expected
that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern
Hemisphere war

   In an allout nuclear holocaust it is known that serious
radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas
not initially hit by war  But there are limits to how far the
war clouds can spread  It was discovered long ago that there is
very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern
Hemispheres  In the northern half of our planet cold air from
the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator then
it works its way back to the north as warm air  A mirror image
of this process takes up the southern half of the planet
Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone
but very little of the air changes places

   The military conclusion my friends is this the coming
nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for
generations to come but if the calculations are right the
Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war
This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers  A
quick look at the globe of the world shows why  The Rockefeller
cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II  As I
discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER Nelson
Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during
the war  He accomplished this as socalled Coordinator of
Hemispheric Defense for thenPresident Franklin D Roosevelt
So that takes care of the South American continent and its
natural resources

   Then there is the African continent  There too Rockefeller
control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa
especially south of the equator  All this was thanks to the
efforts of John D Rockefeller III as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER
No 

   Looking around the globe the most important remaining land
masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and
New Zealand  Thanks to World War II both were wide open to the
Rockefellers

   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military
installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming
war  By this means they expected to become the masters of the
surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern
Hemisphere war  Then as the Northern Hemisphere gradually
recovered from the nuclear holocaust the Rockefeller empire
would be able to pick up the pieces  In this way the third
generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to
inherit the Earth

   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after
the war some means would have to be available to project
military power onto any land mass  For example revolts against
Rockefeller domination would require troopsnot a blast from the
beam weapons on the Moon  The most critical factor for postwar
military domination of the world was found to be a navy  A
minimum of two secret naval fleets would be requiredone based
in the South Atlantic the other in the South Pacific  Since the
reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the
Northern Hemisphere nuclear war they could not be built in
existing shipyards  New construction facilities had to be built
and they had to be hidden  To hide an entire shipyard is no
small task they take up a lot of space  On top of that it was
essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built
The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and
naval base into one overall secret installation  Finally the
secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear
attack otherwise if its existence were ever discovered
prematurely the secret navy might be wiped out

   The combined requirements for secrecy space and protection
against attack were formidable but one day in  while all
these plans were still in the early stages of development the
answer presented itself  During a socalled banking trip to
Sweden David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden
naval port  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs
which come right down to the water  The entrance to the port is
a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off
with enormous steel doors  Inside this big doorway on the water
a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships

   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided
that a bigger more secret better protected version of the
Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted  A survey of
candidate sites was then initiated  The site survey covered
coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere  Many areas
were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong
Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the
equator  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too
many people living nearby making the desired level of secrecy
impossible  Finally it was essential that the sites chosen for
the secret naval installations be totally secure politically

   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were
selected  In the South Pacific extreme southern New Zealand was
selected  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No 
three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme
importance in the coming war

   In order to obtain the necessary space the secret New Zealand
naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located
close together  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South
Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes
down virtually to the water's edge  The other part of the
installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island
which is off the tip of South Island  The Stewart Island
facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt Anglem

   The New Zealand location met all the requirements  Ever since
World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even
closer to the United States than to Great Britain  The location
is far from the equator and the installations are buried deep
under mountains protected from nuclear attack  They are also
too deep to be reached by particlebeam attacks and the New
Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South
Pacific

   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found
That site my friends is South Georgia Island  It is located
perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic  The
tall rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret
installation at the northwest tip of the mile long island
It is controlled by Great Britain whose government like that of
New Zealand was willing to cooperate and South Georgia Island
was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the
northeast coast  The whaling station was some  miles away from
the secret new installation which was being built but Britain
took no chances  In  the whaling station was closed down
Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia
Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists

   Construction of the secret naval facilitiestwo in New
Zealand one on South Georgia Islandbegan in the early 's
The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build
other large underground facilities such as the NORAD
installation inside Cheyenne Mountain Colorado however these
techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve
construction access directly from the sea instead of overland
In this way the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in
appearance both during and after construction

   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let
ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well
camouflaged  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement the
entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up  When
sealed the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you
know exactly where it is and unlike most large construction
projects there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying
around to attract attention  The manmade caverns which house
the secret naval installations are enormous but all the rock and
debris was disposed of at sea

   Once the secret naval facilities were built they had to be
outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage  The fake
disarmament of the United States during the s contributed
greatly to this task  From  to  one man played a pivotal
role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme  He was thenSecretary
of Defense Robert McNamara  All through the 's McNamara
presided over the public paring back of America's visible
military power  This included the closing down and dismantling
of entire shipyards  What we were not told was where all that
shipyard equipment went afterwards  Where it went my friends
was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in
New Zealand and South Georgia Island

   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication
facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and
built here in the United States  As Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told Congress recently it is cheaper to build two
ships at a time  That is especially true if the second ship is
an exact duplicate of the first  This has become even more true
in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing
techniques

   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret
installations are made up of duplicatesexact duplicates of
certain other ships and submarines  They are all nuclear
powerednuclear subs nuclear cruisers nuclear destroyers
and yes nuclear aircraft carriers three of them  A secret twin
was built for the USS Nimitz for the USS Eisenhower and
for the newlylaunched USS Carl Vincent  All have been
financed through the gigantic cost overruns so called that we
constantly hear about in the Defense Department and all three
carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft
whose manufacture was financed the same way

   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are
all duplicates of other nuclearpowered vessels  Even so the
secret naval ships possess one key difference

   Last month I revealed that the socalled Stealth Program has
succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility
shield  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance
by distorting light waves in its vicinity

   A whole new fleet of Phantom warplanes are now going into
crash production that use this principle and my friends all of
the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been
outfitted with similar Stealthfield equipment  The Stealth
principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes
because there is more room for the powerful equipment that
generates the field

   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE the secret Stealth navy of the American
Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on
earth  It would be perfect for the intended role of world
domination  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago my
friends but three years ago they lost control of the United
States Military  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in
control and they are bent on war

   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is
being called the Falklands crisis

Topic In AUDIO LETTERR No  last month I described
PROJECT Z the new Bolshevik threephase strategy for NUCLEAR
WAR ONE

   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here
are flushing out the plan right now at a secret warroom here in
Washington  It's a plan by which the United States will strike
the first nuclear blow followed by allout thermonuclear war
with Russia

   Having set off the holocaust the Bolsheviks here and in
certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable
war bunkers  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in
stalemate they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United
States and her allies  Activating Phase  of their grand
strategy they plan to unveil their secret weapons especially
their secret naval fleets  With these they plan to conquer and
rule what is left of the world  The United States as we know it
will be dead and gone but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks
themselves this outcome will constitute victory

   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two
months ago is still on track  They are still shooting for
nuclear war to begin by September of this year   Time is
fast running out

   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward
war but my friends the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in
this race  They have two deadly enemies both of whom are
equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks  One enemy of the
Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel the other enemy is the
new antiBolshevik ruling clique in Russia and now these two
mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in
certain ways

   In AUDIO LETTER No  three months ago I reported that a
limited new antiBolshevik coalition was in the works between
the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians  The January  meeting
between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva Switzerland was a turning
point in the formation of this coalition  It is now a reality
and is responsible for the socalled Falkland crisis now
dominating the headlines  It should be emphasized that this new
relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far
short of a true alliance  They have very major disputes to be
settled between them but for the time being they have called a
truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly
enemythe Bolsheviks here in America

   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to
slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war
If they can do that time is on the side of the Rockefeller
cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last
summer in AUDIO LETTER No   A slowdown in the nuclear war
timetable will also give more breathing space for additional
antiBolshevik actions to be implemented

   The joint RockefellerRussian planners decided by midFebruary
that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very
quickly  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect
fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer

   The exact details of the PROJECT Z war plan are not known to
either the Rockefellers or the Russians but the general outlines
are known to be as I described last month

   It was decided that military action should be devised that
would undermine Phase  of the Bolshevik war planthat is the
Bolshevikcontrolled secret naval installations and fleets in the
Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled  By working
together the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to
devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone
The Rockefeller group who built and originally controlled these
bases provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to
attack them  The Russians with their enormous military machine
provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack

   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both
secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be
attacked  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the
Bolshevik war plan still workable

   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault
on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question  There was
no combination of commandos frogmen or other military force
which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside
world  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the
very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent

   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different
matter  In a way the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was
also its Achilles' heel  The extreme isolation which protected
the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military
assault feasible  The key lay with Argentina and her
longstanding claims to the Falkland Islands

   As I mentioned in Topic  the Rockefeller cartel has
dominated all of Latin America for decades  Cartel operatives
were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government
military junta there  The historic dispute over the Falkland
Islands was to be used to provide a ruse a military cover to
enable the South Georgia base to be attacked  The Argentine
generals were not told everything about the situation by any
means but they were told enough to make clear what they were to
do

   As an inducement to cooperate the Argentine leaders were
promised handsome rewards  They were guaranteed that after the
shooting was over the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine
hands  This guarantee included the promise of covert military
assistance as needed against the Royal Navy  And to bolster the
troubled Argentine economy it was promised that the Rockefeller
cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves  With
these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards
the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan

   On March  Argentina carried out Act  in the joint attack
plan  A group of Argentine scrapmetal merchants of all things
landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia
Island  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old
buildings and cart them off to sell  While they were at it they
also raised the Argentine flag over the worksite  The British
always nervous about South Georgia Island promptly reacted as
expected  The British Antarctic survey ship Endurance put 
Marines ashore  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down
the Argentine flag

   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine
Junta to bring the simmering yearold Falklands dispute to a
boil  From time to time in the past Argentina has claimed that
South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered
that way by Britain  That argument is very flimsy but it now
came in very handy  It was nothing new to hear this from
Argentine leaders so there was no hint of what was really afoot

   During late March Argentine military forces started
assembling for an assault on the Falklands  Nothing new
thought the British high command  Argentina has carried out
threatening maneuvers in the past many times  It was believed
that they were about to do it again but on April  Argentine
forces did the unexpected  After many past false alarms this
time they actually invaded and seized the Islands  All Argentine
public statements emphasized the longstanding historical claims
to the Falklands themselves but just for good measure the next
day a small Argentine force also seized faroff South Georgia
Island  The force was so small that it gave the appearance
initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of
view however the small contingent of  Royal Marines were
overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 
alleged scientists  That was the moment of payoff in the joint
RockefellerRussian attack plan

   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine
forces a special commando team got onto the Island undetected
Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base the
team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the
cavernous secret base  Special highspeed drilling equipment was
set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian
members concentrated on military defense  By late that evening
April  the military high command in London finally learned what
was really taking place  The secret South Georgia base was under
attack by virtually the only means possible  The joint
RockefellerRussian team were drilling a shaft down through the
mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside  It was only a
matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling
of the giant hidden naval base  Once the hole was made the next
step was obvious  The RockefellerRussian team would put a
weapon of some kind through the hole  The best guess was that it
would be a nerve gas

   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the
British government on the evening of April  can hardly be
described my friends  The Thatcher government like the
socalled Reagan Administration here in America is Bolshevik
controlled  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says Me too
any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against
Russia  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war
plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective
countries and on the evening of April  they suddenly discovered
that their precious war plan was in deep deep trouble

   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval
armada to sail for the South Atlantic  Haste was the order of
the day  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding
around the clock  The best estimates were that the drilling
would break through into the roof of the naval base in about
three weeks on or about April   If help did not reach South
Georgia by then the secret installation might be doomed  The
forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend
themselves under the circumstances  Their mighty naval ships
were ships in a bottle  They did not dare open the bottle to
sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with
tactical and nuclear weapons  To open the blastproof entrance
doors would be suicide

   On April  just two days after South Georgia Island was
seized some  naval ships began moving out of British ports
The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister  He
was forced to resign my friends because he had assisted the
Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack
preparations

   That same day April  New Zealand the home of the other
secret naval fleet broke diplomatic relations with Argentina
The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on Red
Alert  As a precautionary measure all submarines at the twin
base were ordered to sea  Several surface ships were already at
sea undergoing sea trials but that still left seven  major
ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the
nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier

   On that busy day of April  Argentina's Foreign Minister
Costa Mendez was at the United Nations in New York  He was
alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy
Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from
certain officials  He got them

   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories
about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while
negotiations went on  That my friends was only a cover story
The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as
possible toward South Georgia Island  If the task force arrived
in time to save the secret base a major battle was likely  The
official stories about slow movement of the British armada were
intended to give a cushion of time for that battle  If need be
the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island
then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the
announced schedule  In this way the crucial importance of South
Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved

   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British
fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two
weeks  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint
RockefellerRussian commando team and stop the drilling before it
was completed  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a
shambles of the plan

   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent
left Ascension Island early April  two days before it was
announced officially  Shortly after they did so they ran into
trouble  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on
a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on
South Georgia Island  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and
combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation  In
moments the ship was without any command its communications and
radar silenced  Then a Russian sub closed in and quickly
finished off this key British ship with torpedoes  It broke
apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly  So far as is
known there were no survivors

   This unexpected shock in the midAtlantic produced two
results both important

First it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic
by the British armada  The task force had to be regrouped into a
configuration better suited for an enroute defense but that cost
valuable time  Public announcements from London about the
progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown  The timetable for
arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching
out longer and longer  All this bought extra time for the joint
commando team on South Georgia Island  The drilling continued

The other result of the sinking was equally important  Word was
flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible
action  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting
involved in the Atlantic which meant that the Royal Navy could
be in big trouble  During the dead of night early April  the
seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in
southern New Zealand  They deployed to a secret operational
headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands  miles southeast
of New Zealand  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to
provide protection from attack  These shields make it impossible
to communicate with the outside world or even to see it as I
explained last month but once they arrived at the Antipodes the
Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded
communication cables to the Island headquarters  The Antipodes
headquarters in turn was in constant touch with the South
Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of
South America  The deployment of the available ships of the
South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint
RockefellerRussian planners had hoped for  The ships had been
flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in
New Zealand

   The British ship's sinking of April  was also followed by
other events  On April  the Argentine Navy started moving out
of port  The same day Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos
Aires  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat but in reality he
was there as a General dealing with Generals  Haig is the top
Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel as I have
revealed in the past  He was making sure that the Argentines did
not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment  Four
days later April  Haig left for Washington  As he boarded
his plane Haig somberly told reporters Time is running out
And so it was my friends for the secret South Georgia base

   The very next day April  the drill broke through into the
hollowedout cavern of the naval base  Bolshevik military
analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed
until at least the following weekend  The British fleet was
still out of range

   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the
long hole was a small compact Russian neutron bomb  When it was
detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave the
effects were devastating  The intense radiation instantly killed
everyone inside the base  Also the heat and blast effects of the
bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside
sufficiently to badly disable them

   Meanwhile Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging
on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands
awaiting orders  From a distance the ships were invisible to
the eye due to their protective shields which also protect
against beamweapon attack but they were sitting ducks for the
tactics which the Russians employed

   Floating overhead the Cosmospheres located the seven ships
using their Psychoenergetic RangeFinding equipment known as PRF
As I have reported in the past there is no method known by which
PRF can be jammed  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations
of the ships to the attack submarines  The subs were armed
with special nonhoming nonnuclear torpedoes designed to
explode on impact  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been
thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective
shield of each ship but these simple torpedoes just cruise right
through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode
Within  minutes after the attack began all seven Bolshevik
Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom and with them went
their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from
around the world

   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local
time  The time here in Washington was around  PM April 
That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public
with the new British Foreign Minister Francis Pym  Pym was
wearing the artificial pseudosmile which diplomats are taught
always to display in public  But not Haig  Haig was grinning
from ear to ear and no wonder  The joint RockefellerRussian
military operation had been a brilliant success  The secret
Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out
bottled up inside South Georgia Island and the South Pacific
fleet while not totally wiped out had been badly crippled  By
working together the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won
the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere

Topic As I say these words news reports give the impression
that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic but the real
war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over  What we are
watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath  That
aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands  They have been
promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war

   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing
for a public announcement that the United States will side with
Britain  As soon as that takes place military action will heat
up fast around the Falklands  Britain has no choice but to
fight  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be
explained without a public battle but by fighting the
Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and
tragic defeat for the Royal Navy

   Meanwhile the Rockefeller strategists here are now
concentrating on a fastbuilding antinuclearwar campaign  On
all sides now we are hearing about the socalled nuclear freeze
movement  There are documentaries articles publicity of all
kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war  In recent
months there have even been referenda popping up on election
ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue  Medical doctors are
banding together to warn the public about what would happen if
there were a nuclear war

   We are being told that all this is just popping up
spontaneously  We are now  years into the nuclear age and
nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before yet
now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have
spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time  If you
believe that my friends I give up  Movements like this never
and I mean never develop without leadership organization and
moneyand plenty of it

   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations
machine at work  As I've explained in the past the Rockefeller
cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place  If it
does they will lose everything because they are not in a
position to control it  Instead the deadly enemies of the
Rockefeller cartel the Bolsheviks here will win out if there is
a war and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in
its power to prevent a nuclear war

   The present antinuclearwar orientation of the Rockefeller
cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them
and Russia but as Russia's new rulers know very well this does
not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the
Rockefeller group  It's purely a matter of practical necessity
right now for the Rockefellers

   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided and
they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with
the Rockefellers  Their first priority is to rid the world of
the deadly Bolshevik menace of allout even suicidal nuclear
war but once that is done they know that there will be a day of
reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day

   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective
with their new antinuclearwar propaganda  That objective is
renewed powerand power that moves them closer to their old
dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly
provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar
campaign  Under Bolshevik control the socalled Reagan
Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people
The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on
that latent fear as a tool of power

   These days the smell of war is in the air  The Falklands
crisis is helping to make that more intense  The Rockefeller
propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that
surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war  A new
superUnited Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the
bill  It will have teeth  As presently envisioned the new
organization will be based in Geneva Switzerland  The working
name though this may be changed is the World Nonproliferation
Council  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of
nuclear nonproliferation treaties but its true purpose will be
to use fearthe fear of warto control us all

                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY

   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary  In this AUDIO
LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the socalled
Falkland Islands crisis  The crisis erupted because of secret
Bolshevikcontrolled naval installations in the Southern
Hemisphere  These have been attacked by joint action of the
Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down
the nuclearwar timetable  The attacks were successful but the
results remain to be seen  One result though is that the Royal
Navy has now been drawn into a trap  Britain's Waterloo at sea
may well be at hand

   My friends two factions are struggling for control over our
United Statesthe Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks  They
differ in style but both seek to control us through fear  If we
are ever to rise above their trickery it must be through the
power of our Lord Jesus Christ our only hope  As the Scripture
tells us our Lord has not given us the spirit of fear but
of power of love and of a sound mind  We must learn to wage
peace  As our Lord declared long ago Blessed are the
peacemakers for they shall be called sons of God

   Until next month God willing this is Dr Beter  Thank you
and may God bless each and every one of you

The official and legal term for rape is the crime of forcing a FEMALE
to submit to sexual intercourse

Please supply me with some references  I was not aware that all states
had the word FEMALE in the rape statutes  I am sure others are surprised
as well  I know thats how it works in practice nicenfair NOT but
was unaware that it was in the statutes as applying to FEMALES only
uniformly throughout the US

I agree mostly with Chris  It is unfortunately IMO true that the FBI
figures for rape based on the 'uniform crime report' report only female
rapes However some states such as Illinois are not tabluated because they
refuse to comply with this sexist definition

The worms crawl in
The worms crawl out
The worms post to the net from your account

Insofar as several liberal jurisdictions are concerned the essential
elements of rape are gender neutral Nonetheless I decided to provide
a number of references to support my original argument Black's Law
Dictionary every law studentlawyer's friend defines rape as Unlawful
sexual intercourse with a female without her consent The unlawful
knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will The Model
Penal Code the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners
of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures
defines rape as A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife
is guilty of rape if he a compels her to submit by force or by threat of
imminent death MPC a

                  Office of the Press Secretary
                  Vancouver British Columbia

For Immediate Release                               April  


                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS

                           Canada Place
                   Vancouver British Columbia



 PM PDT


	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents so you
could probably answer for Boris too  Laughter

	     THE PRESIDENT  I'll give you my answer then I'll
give you Yeltsin's answer  Laughter

	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the
Presidents so the money that's being promised is government
money and naturally it's going to be distributed through the
government  But you've indicated that threequarters are going
to be going to businesses  So the question is how the Russian
businesses themselves are going to be consulted if ever  What
are the priorities because there are several association of
Russian businessmen existing already so will they be invited to
participate in setting up priorities for investment

	     This is the first  And second to you  We know
that polls public polls in America do not show that Americans
are very enthusiastic about giving this aid  Like Newsweek polls
say that about  percent don't approve it and New York Times
published that  percent support if it just prevents civil war
 percent if it fosters democratic reform and only  percent
if it just personally supports Yeltsin  How are you going to
sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not
very enthusiastic  Thank you

	     Q	  I have a question I'm sorry  is there going
to be a translation of everything into Russian  No just the
answers  Just the answers  Okay

	     THE PRESIDENT  The answer to the first question is
it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing  For example
the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will
obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be
good risks and make the application  The privatization fund will
be used to support the privatization of existing public
enterprises  Then there are some other general funds in the
Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have
some influence over the distribution of

	     With regard to your second question let me say that
I would think that there would be people in both countries who
would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government
giving money to the Russian government  There's opposition to
that in Russia  And in our country throughout our whole history
there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds  That
is this has nothing to do with Russia  If you look at the whole
history of America any kind of aid program has always been
unpopular

	     What I have tried to tell the American people is is
this is not an aid program this is an investment program that
this is an investment in our future  We spent  trillion 
trillion  on armaments on soldiers and other investments
because of the Cold War  Now with a democratic government in
Russia with the newly independent states the remainder of them
working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies
going it seems to me very much in our interest to make it
possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive for the
economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and
investment there and for us to continue the effort to reduce
nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides on
our side and on the Russian side

	     So I don't see this as an aid program this is an
investment for the United States  This is very much in the
interest of the United States  The things I announced today the
second stage of the program which I hope to put together next
week in my view are things that are good for my country and for
the taxpayers and workers of my country

	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some
partnership now some common endeavor with other people who share
her goals  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view
this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue  That's not
what it is it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful
investment

	     Like all investments there is some risk  But
there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than
the  trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier
of the Cold War

	     Q	  Mr President first of all thank you very
much indeed for coming here and talking to us  In the memory
of the living correspondents this is the first time an American
President is doing this to the Russian press corps so it's kind
of a very measured breakthrough

	     I have two questions  One in your introductory
remarks of the other press conference you mentioned in brief
that you discussed the START II and START I issues  Could you
tell us  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to
what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification
of START I and the NPT regime  And my second question is how
confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager
to support you in lifting JacksonVanik and other restrictions
inherited from the Cold War

	     PRESIDENT CLINTON  First we discussed the issue of
Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT and generally with
regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent
states all be nonnuclear but also to have the United States
develop strong relationships with them  We know that one thing
that we could do that would increase I think the willingness of
the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude
our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium because that
would provide not only an important economic opportunity for
Russia but also for Ukraine and it would show some reaching out
on our part  But we agreed that basically the people who signed
off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did and
we agreed to continue to press that

	     I myself have spent a good deal of time trying to
reassure Ukraine's leaders specifically the President and the
Foreign Minister that I want strong ties with Ukraine that the
United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine
but that in order to do what we need to do together to
strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States
be fully supportive the commitment to ratify START I and to join
the NPT regime is critical

	     What was the second question

	     THE PRESIDENT  With regard to JacksonVanik and
COCOM I would make two points  First I have agreed with the
Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will
as soon as I return have a list of all the legislative and other
restrictions some of them are regulatory in nature imposed on
relations between the United States and Russia that are legacies
of the Cold War  And we will see whether they're  how many of
them we could agree to do away with right now at least among the
leadership of the Congress

	     With regard to JacksonVanik I think there will be
an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there
are in fact no more refusniks no more people who wish to
emigrate who are not being allowed to  If the fact is that there
is no one there who would have been  who the law was designed
to affect then I think that the desire to keep the law will be
much less

	     With regard to COCOM my guess is and it's nothing
more than a guess that the leadership of Congress and indeed my
own advisers might prefer to see some sort of phased movement
out of the COCOM regime  But I think they would be willing to
begin it in the fairly near future

	     Q	  Mr Clinton when I read your speech in
Annapolis I got the impression that you have a completely
different personal  and I stress that  personal not
political approach towards Russia compared to the approach of
Mr Bush  Could you formulate in a few words what is the
difference between you as a personality and your approach  the
difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of
Mr Bush  And who made you  why did you cite Akhmatova in the
last part of your speech

	     THE PRESIDENT  Let me say first I do not wish to
compare myself with President Bush or anyone else  I can't say
what was in his heart about Russia  I can say that since I was a
boy I have been personally fascinated with the history the
music and the culture and the literature of Russia  I have been
thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music
for more than  years now  I have read major Russian novelists
and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know
as much as I could about your history

	     And I went to the Soviet Union  but it was then
the Soviet Union  you may know it was a big issue in the last
presidential campaign that I spent the first week of  alone
in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr
Yeltsin was elected President  But all that time I was away I
was following events there very closely and hoping for the day
when we could be genuine partners  So I have always had a
personal feeling about Russia

	     I remember for example  a lot of you know I like
music very much  One of the most moving experiences for me as a
musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York
Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony
to the Russians  And he played the last movement more rapidly
than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically
so difficult  That is something I followed very closely when it
occurred

	     These are things that have always had a big impact
on my life  And I had just always hoped that someday if I ever
had the chance to I could play a role in seeing our two
countries become closer partners  Applause

	     THE PRESS  Thank you

                               END PM PDT

  I don't know what you as a white male did I do know what white males
as a class have done
  They've invented the light bulb the automobile the airplane printing with
movable type photography computers the electric guitar anasthesia rocket
powered space flight the computer electricity the telephone TV motion
pictures penecillinsp telescopes nylon and the XRay machine

Two glaring errors here  First white males don't do anything as a class
INDIVIDUAL white males invented those things which means nothing to white
males as a whole  Second you neglected to mention Charles Manson Hitler
McCarthy Jack the Ripper Ted Bundy and a whole slew of individuals who
have done horrible evil things  If white males can take the credit for
our fellow white males' boons we must also take the blame for our
fellows' blights  I claim we deserve neither credit nor blame for these
things

White males need to wake up and realize that they're being unfair yes  But
everyone else needs to wake up and realize that being unfair right back is
disgusting racist and sexist
Why can't we learn to treat everyone fairly without generalizing  What
stupidity gene makes this so difficult  I'd like to buy the world a
clue

	The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the B
word or the H word or even the N or W words It is the L word 
LOSER 

	That's right When we boil all the crap out of this argument it
is all about WINNING and LOSING and nothing else Let me explain
	In the meantime there is guilt for winning maybe a fear that one
doesn't deserve one's bounty  or success So there is a kinder and gentler
type of politician these days Bill Clinton affirmative action and lots of
discourse about people who don't get it For those of us in the winning
business this kind of talk is mildly irritating but there is still no
suggestion of losing
	Who is DFENS anyway  The answer is as plain as the horn rims on
your face The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS posing as a LOSER This
is known as controversial casting But that baggy shortsleeved white shirt
sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it Gordon Gekko will never look the
same Though Woody always dressed that way Did we really expect Gekko to
take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe without putting up a fuss 
	What we are starting to lose sight of is that bashing DFENS is
the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood
used to blow away all the time As that archWASP male gender George C Scott
declaimed Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN They love a winner and will
not tolerate a loser And so on

Since we are talking in theory and opinion then I'll put in my 
	First a rebuttle Personally I love underdogs Unlike
bandwagon jumpers I abandon teams when they start winning People that
cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are
afraid to be associated with something negative

	The political implications are simple If as many socialists  and
Democrats  do you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some
equitable way then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a
loser to tell whose side you are on That could be black women today Asian
homosexuals tommorrow and yes indeed white men some yet to be determined
day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that 
minority

On this one point I agree The reason that people bash WASP's is
because they have been on top for a long time Whoever is on top is
going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top
If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might
all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people
for all these centuries I seriously doubt that if the blacks had
conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any
betterworse than the whites did
	The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of
the world But they only did what any other conquering race would have done
ie Khan The real question is should we carry over that blame to the
present generation who didn't participate in the crimes Would it do
any good Has it done Bosnia any good They are fighting wars that stopped
hundreds even thousands of years ago
	My opinion is if there are inequities now then let's change
them But don't blame me for what my ancestors did It wouldn't settle
anything anyway

	Either way you go the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be
popular  at least after you graduate from High School but you'll still
be popular at High School reunions But it beats being a Nerd as I
would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree and in the long run it
is the only way to go

That's where you are dead wrong You don't join up on a side just because
they are winning That makes you spineless Winning in high school and
after high school is still the best way to be popular but it doesn't make
you right All the best causes in history were loosing causes with only
a couple exceptions Winning only makes a difference to other people not
to yourself And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care
how you appear ie a Winner

	If you can't beat them fight them every inch of the way

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary


For Immediate Release                                   April  


                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS


                          The Briefing Room


  AM EDT

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As you know the President is soon
to be on his way on Amtrack to Camden Yards  He'll be throwing out
the first pitch

	     Q	  It's MARC the Maryland Area Transit it's not
Amtrack

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh it's not Amtrack  Well he's
going from Union Station you're right  Excuse me

	     Q	  George what exactly are you prepared to do to
break the logjam with   Senate

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well as you know there are
discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning
and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point
that he believes that our investment package our jobs package needs
to be passed as quickly as possible  We need this investment for
summer jobs for immunization for highway construction for the
important programs that will put people back to work right away this
summer  And the President continues to believe his program should be
passed

	     Q	  Will he compromise that's the question

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well as you know the discussions
are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and
Senator Dole let's see what they come up with  But the President
believes his jobs program should go forward

	     Q	  George would the President be willing to accept 
billion for one year which apparently appears to be the compromise
being offered by 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I don't know what is being
offered by either side  The Senate discussions are going on right
now let's see what happens today

	     Q	  Would he go that far  no matter what the
Republicans have offered so far would he go that far  billion per
year

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President believes that his
program should be passed at this time  Clearly we're going to be
willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to
come up with but I'm not going to get into figures right now  Let's
see what happens

	     Q	  It's reasonable to assume isn't it from what has
happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order
to get a vote

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the Republicans seem more
intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill than in
doing something to create   MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the
Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the
President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action
real jobs this summer for the American people  I think there's no
question about that  There's been some frustration of legislative
activity over the last few days

	     Q	  So you'll need to compromise to get your package
through

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We'll see what happens with the
conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning

	     Q	     prepared to compromise 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President's prepared to listen
to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting
with Senator Dole

	     Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not in the least  In fact he's
been very successful so far in the beginning of his term

	     Q	  How

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He passed his budget in record
time in six weeks and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by
 billion over five years  And it's a budget which provides for
important investments in our future  Right now we've also had strong
passage of his jobs program through the House  Simply because a
minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock
and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that
he is not succeeding overall

	     Q	  He can't beat this can he

	     Q	  The fact is they can do that

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the Republicans can stop
action  There's no question about that

	     Q	  What are you going to do about it

	     Q	  George what do you know about these alleged notes
taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears
that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese that
when they say yes they mean no

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that's a complete
misreading of what happened at the meeting  The context of the
conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring
President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime
Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's
belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G process
I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and
etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where
he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese
were serious about their commitment to the G process

	     Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when
the Japanese say yes they mean no

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That's not  I don't know the
exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say
something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime
Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G process

	     Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the
Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and
there appears to be 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I've seen the reports in the
Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context  It
does talk about the Japanese  understanding the Japanese points of
view  I don't think it's going to be a problem  I believe that
there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up
but I'm not positive

	     Q	  George was the specific comment that was made
specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general
observation on Japanese etiquette

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The discussion was about 

	     Q	  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that
has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes when the
Japanese say yes they mean no

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well it was a combination  I mean
I don't think that's the whole sentence  I think that the specific
comment was a broad general observation followed up by a specific
finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that
Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment

	     Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think it was just a casual
observation

	     Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to
clear it up  Has the President sent a message

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No I don't think the President
spoke I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but
I'm not sure exactly how many

	     Q	  Well this obviously is a bigger deal than you're
making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No no  It was just that we got
the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that
it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS   reports in Vancouver and the
Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure
there is absolutely no misunderstanding and I don't believe there is
on

	     Q	  What is our position about the Japanese  That they
may have to say one thing but actualy mean another

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  The position on the Japanese
is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two
days  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime
Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit  He reiterated the US
position the longstanding support for the Japanese position on the
Kuril Islands but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's
commitment to move forward on the G process and to play a
constructive role  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to
hear that

	     Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq
for the last few days I'm a little confused  What is the US
policy  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It's the same policy that Secretary
Christopher has reiterated and all of the US officials have
reiterated  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance
with all UN resolutions  Right now we do not have that compliance

	     Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies
Saddam can't stay in office

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Right  I think that that's  our
judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with
the resolutions and stay in power  But the important point is that
we expect compliance by Iraq with all UN resolutions and we will
continue to demand it

	     Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the
dominant power in the area 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Secretary Christopher has also
spoken to Iran over the last several days and he says we also expect
full Iranian compliance with all international norms and stopping
support of terrorism

	     Q	  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in
power if he complies with UN resolutions  On what logic do you
base that

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Right now Saddam Hussein is not
complying with the UN resolutions at all  He is not respecting the
rights of his people as is required by the UN resolution  He is
not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections
He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding
armaments

	     Q	  Well when do you think that if he did comply he
would be out of power

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well right now his power rests on
the repression of his people  If he stopped doing that it would make
it more difficult for him to stay in power

	     Q	  George back on the stimulus package why is it
that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure
politics and perpetuating gridlock  Why is it that  what evidence
do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical
difference with you that's in good faith

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the fact that several times
in the past the Republicans many of the ones who are now leading the
fight for the filibuster have supported the very funding they now
seek to stop most especially the highway funding

	     Q	  George in regards to that some of the moderate
Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to
them during the  while the plan was put together that they had
one sort of proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate
Republicans and that was it  Does the Administration look back and
thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some 


	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I'm not sure that it's true
that there was only one meeting  I mean the President met with the
Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the
introduction of his package  He met with the entire Senate
Republican Caucus also for lunch and went up there  We are
continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who
have an interest in the President's package  We are interested in
what they have to say as well  But we believe that this program is
important and we're going to continue to fight for it

	     Q	     your all or nothing do it with the Democrats
alone strategy did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it
through

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I mean I think that there is
no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can
frustrate activity  I mean there is just no question about that
You only need  plus one to keep going   plus one to keep going
and to stop any action and that's what the Republicans are doing

	     Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get
other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of
the summer

	     Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some
Republicans into your camp

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think we're going to continue to
look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the
President's intiatives

	     Q	  But on this one  how are you going to do it
differently than you did it on this one because on this one you
really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear
that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and
could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes
Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for
particular votes  When you have to go through 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I can't see into the future and
understand every possible turn in the legislative road  Clearly the
President's going to continue to reach out when he can

	     Q	  You don't have any regrets then about the way you
have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your
approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this
experience

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Obviously the President would like
his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue
to press for that  We will continue to reach out to Republicans
there's not question about that  And we'll continue to reason with
them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation  In this
case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster around
a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward

	     Q	  They're being denied any other legislative means of
putting their proposals forward

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think they're being 

	     Q	     any ideas

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think their amendments are being
defeated I don't know that they're being denied

	     Q	     to present them

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That's not exactly true  I mean
they get the votes 

	     Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the
parliamentary rules under which they're playing

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Unless they get a majority in
support all the way around no that's not exactly true

	     Q	  George one more on Iraq  Is the administration
backing any of the Iraqi opposition  Grooming any new leadership

	     Q	     backing any of the Iraqi  leadership

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh I  again we're pressing for
Iraqi compliance  I don't know if we can get into the business of
grooming leadership  I believe there have been some contacts at
some levels with Iraqi opposition groups  I don't know  about
anything recently

	     Q	     Jesse Jackson who of course is not the
President's best friend has however been told that there is to be
some kind of town meeting or some kind of involvement by the
President preempted the ball game  Los Angeles  Will he consider
something like that or any other kind of intervention there

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well as you know the President
appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown about  days ago to be a
special envoy to California and coordiante cabinet activities around
the California economic situation including the situation in Los
Angeles

	     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles
by the Education  or have been visits by the Education Secretary
Mr Riley  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD
Secretary Cisneros are also going out  And there may be other visits
by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks  I
wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to
California  Obviously he is following the situation closely and is
concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy
decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities
which help prevent disturbances  But we're going to continue to
watch it

	     Q	  George as a followup Reverend Jackson is also
supposed to be outside the ball park today in Baltimore with a
group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball
management  Does the President have a position on that

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has received
correspondence from Reverend Jackson  I know that Reverend Jackson
has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty
He clearly raises serious questions  There has been some progress in
baseball over the last several years but still not enough  But the
President intends to continue to go to the ball game

	     Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today or see
Reverend Jackson while he's out there

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if he is going to see
them but as I said the President believes that Reverend Jackson has
raised some serious questions and it's something that as I said
even though there has been progress it's clearly not enough

	     Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball
game

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm not sure about that  I believe
the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an
informational pickett  I don't know that he asked him not to go to
the ball game but he sent a long detailed formal letter outlining
his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the
President read it

	     Q	  George the Orioles are playing the Rangers the
managing partner of the Rangers is George W Bush  Is he going to be
there and is he going to meet with the President

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know

	     Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I know that President Mubarak is
coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting they will have a
lunch and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice
President Gore

	     Q	  And joint statements tomorrow 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I believe so yes  At the end
yes

	     Q	  Is there evidence George that the Egyptians did
warn the US about a potential terrorist bombing  terrorist
activities

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As reported in The New York Times
I mean I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been
general conversations with the Egyptians as there have been for a
long period of time  We do have general intelligence sharing I
mean  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there
was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward
The President will continue to investigate the situation but he also
reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind

	     Q	  George he did make specific  or the Egyptians
apparently did issue specific warnings about this individual who
forgive me this individual who forgive me the name escapes me at
the moment and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in
their attempts to get some kind of action

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I don't know if I would
agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview  He did
say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a
network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate
action  But there was no specific information on this specific
operation at all

	     Q	  So the White House doesn't feel that any of the
law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have
received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in
not pursuing some kind of 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No not at all

	     Q	  What's next with Serbia  It got only a passing
mention in the news conference yesterday 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  You didn't get to ask your
question

	     Q	  Yes exactly  Was there any agreement on concerted
action between the two countries  And even if there wasn't what
does the US do next

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think the US is clearly going
to move forward in the UN today continuing discussions with our
allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways
to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an
agreement

	     Q	  George why do you think sanctions is still an
option  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the
leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait
you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day
said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any
time soon  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan  When
does no mean no and you have to do something different

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I mean we are doing something
different  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the
UN and those discussions will continue  We're going to continue to
try and tighten the noose on Serbia and I think that every
opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time

	     Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo
MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has said that this is something
that is under consideration

	     Q	  George do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's
condition how he's doing

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As far as I know nothing's changed

	     Q	  George  week after Mr Mubarak

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It's a little unclear  I think
we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning
after the Mubarak visit

	     Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not that I know of

	     Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid
to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He's going to be consulting with
the Congress and with our G partners over the next couple of weeks
I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their
delegation before the  the congressional delegation meets with the
Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the
next several weeks

	     Q	  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude
of the one announced Sunday

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm not going to discuss the
magnitude

	     Q	  How about the list of Cold War restrictions where
do you stand on that 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As the President said yesterday
he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week
and reviewing it  He believes  he's going to try and get it this
week and he's going to review the list and we're going to take a
hard look at it

	     Q	  But they're making it up  I mean it's no White
House involvement Congress is compiling this list

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think he's going to talk to the
congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll
be able to get our own researchers working as well

	     Q	  George isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a
probability than a possibility

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It's something that's under
discussion

	     Q	  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter
of time and  for months before that happens

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again all I can say is that it's
something that the President is reviewing  Right now we're working
with our allies in the UN on a sanctions resolution and we'll
continue to review other matters

	     Q	  George can you tell us anything about the schedule
this week  Any travel

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They just asked about that  I
don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right
now

	     Q	  Are there consultations George with any Jewish
American organizations concerning JacksonVanick

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As you know the National Conference
of Soviet Jewry has a list of I believe
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS   as you know the National
Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of I believe  Refuseniks
We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate
discussions

	     Thanks

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary


For Immediate Release                                  April  

                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
        EN ROUTE TO CAMDEN YARDS FOR ORIOLES OPENING DAY GAME

                              MARC Train
                       En Route to Camden Yards



 AM EDT

	     Q	  Mr President what do you think of Jesse Jackson's
protest today

	     THE PRESIDENT  I think it's an informational protest
I think it's fine  The owners put out a statement few days ago
which they say was the first step in you know efforts to increase
minority ownership and minority increases in management  I think we
should  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado
And I think it's time to make a move on that front  So I think it's
a legitimate issue and I think it's  like I said it's an
informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to
the game  So I think it's good

	     Q	  Do you think they're moving fast enough

	     THE PRESIDENT  Well I think that it was a good first
step  And I think you'll see some movement now  And I think it's an
issue that deserves some attention and they're obviously going to
give it some  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will
highlight the issue  So I think it's fine

	     Q	  Mr President how about the logjam in the Senate
on the economic stimulus plan  Do you think they'll be able to break
that and get cloture

	     THE PRESIDENT  I don't know we're working at it  I
mean it's a classic  there was an article in the paper today one
of the papers I saw which pretty well summed it up  They said you
know this is a  it's just a political power play  In the Senate
the majority does not rule  It's not like the country  It's not
like the  it's not like the House  If the minority chooses they
can stop majority rule  And that's what they're doing  There are a
lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote
for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political
pressure not to do it

	     And of course what it means is that in this time when
no new jobs are being created even though there seems to be an
economic recovery it means that for political purposes they're
willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston
and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle  It's very
sad  I mean the block grant program was designed to create jobs in
a hurry based on local priorities and it's one that the Republicans
had always championed  Just about the only Democrat champions of the
program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots
level governors and senators  I just think it's real sad that they
have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep
Americans out of work  I think it's a mistake

	     THE PRESS  Thank you

  In article optilinkCOM crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer writes
   Gay men constitute at least  of all child molestations  Whether
   this is because gay molesters are unusually common or have unusually
   high numbers of victims sort of misses the point doesn't it  It
   means that whichever is the case homosexual men are remarkably
   hazardous to children
 
 Clayton says
 
 You are incorrect  The most recent survey data I can find shows that
  of molestation is exclusively homosexuals  is bisexual victims
 are both male and female and the remainder is exclusively heterosexual

     So what you are saying is that  of the child molestations are
   committed by heterosexuals I cannot see the correlation you cite

Bisexuals are heterosexuals  Since when

   which concludes that by being homosexual you will molest children or that
   by being homosexual you will have the propensity for molesting children

I haven't said that homosexual  child molester simply that is more
likely

   If  of the molestations are by homosexuals why are you so concerned
   about creating a relation between the two If you had evidence that
    of the molestations are committed by homosexuals you might find a
   relationship Ok where is the realtionship you make

The one that is shown when NAMBLA marches in gay parades

     Also what is the reason people molest From Human Sexuality and a
   psych class or too I have taken the overwhelming voice says that people
   commit these acts as power trips and to feel in control This has nothing
   to do with sexual orientation

You mean that SM because it's a power trip has nothing to do with
sexual orientation

Anyone with any degree of sensitivity or awareness has to be
concerned about the horrendous amount of child abuse that
exists in this country 

The critical factor here is whether the sexual activity is forced  

When a child is forced there is often damage on the other hand
consensual relationships are often found to be positive experiences
for all concerned

Why all the quote marks Roy  I can see that they might be appropriate where
there is a legitimate concern that the words are being distorted by context
or that they have been appropriated Newspeakstyle but reading your comments above
one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that child abuse
forced sexual activity and damage caused by this is nonexistant or
greatly overblown

Positive experiences indeed

   Abortions destructive of the fetus must be permitted even
    just before birth if they promote what the Supreme Court
    calls health''

 Yes Doug we all know that Roe v Wade prevents states from prohibiting
 abortions necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman  Only
 very stupid people such as yourself confuse a discussion of mental health
 related to Jane Doe who was in a mental institution and attempt to claim
 that this same argument could be applied to a woman who decided she wanted
 an abortion because she was having a bad hair day

 As you well know the facts are that there are about  thirdtrimester
 abortions performed in this country annually and those are only done for
 serious health reasons
 
 Larry Margolis MARGOLIYKTVMV Bitnet margoliwatsonIBMcom Internet

Hmmm  Human gestation period is something like  weeks  That means
third trimester abortions are those done after  weeks  In consulting
a  World Almanac I see that  of abortions in  were done at
 weeks or more  That's about  abortions in  after  weeks
Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically or
a LOT of abortions are done between  and  weeks I think you are
wrong

By the way Roe v Wade allowed states to adopt very very broad
prohibitions on thirdtrimester abortions but some states such as
California declined to do so  It was reported that what finally
stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law
but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses then doctors
willing to do them  Not surprisingly the bay area NOW chapter was
terribly upset about this

I remain prochoice but when prochoicers compare abortion in a
clinic to a religious ritual in a church you have to start wondering
a bit if the prolife criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
doesn't have a grain of truth to it

NAMBLA's presence in the SF Gay Pride Parade says quite a bit
It says that either the parade organizers want to show support
for NAMBLA or they themselves have a fundamental misunderstanding
of their rights and responsibilities  I would really really like
to believe the latter but I would need some help to do so

 There are dozens of examples of the latter NAMBLA is an especially
 glaring one but hardly the only one

Perhaps though the exclusion of the Gay Perotistas in the
SF Gay Pride Parade would make me think that they had some
clue in this regard  Dozens of examples  I don't know

It should be noted that NAMBLA has not been present in the
other  or so gay parades in the nation While I view this
as an isolated event I am very troubled by its reccurence

I hope I'm not going to hate myself for getting involved in
this discussion but I felt obliged to keep things factually
accurate

Last year NAMBLA marched in the Pride Parades in Boston New
York and San Francisco It was not the first time we
participated in these parades and it will not be the last I
have marched with the NAMBLA contingent in New York every
year for more than a decade

Thank you for correcting the error in my post to the net
This information came from a newspaper article that was
fuzzy in my mind  I can only wonder if there have been
similar outcries about NAMBLA's presence in the parades
of New York and Boston

I would suggest that legal precedent defines a human being ie a person
whose rights are protected by the Constitution and the law as someone with
a functioning brain

No if you want to use legal precedent you should take a look at the
Model Penal Code on which many states base their criminal code

My apologies if I was unclear I was not trying to start a statutory
debate since there are many in some cases conflicting statutes on
the books  I was merely suggesting a paradigm that might make sense
for a prochoicer IMHO

And I was pointing out that legal precedent defines a human being as
referring only to the born so your suggestion was incorrect

If at some point an unborn child is a human being the parents clearly
have the same responsibilities toward her as any other parents have toward
their children

And no parent can be forced to supply bodily resources toward their children
even if necessary to save the child's life

There is a confusion here between action and inaction a parent does not have
to run out in front of a bus to save their child's life either but a parent
IS required to feed his children

There is a confusion here about what bodily resources constitutes  Blood
transfusions and organ donations involve bodily resources your examples
do not

 Don't look at me  I want to send aid to Russia  Many other
 conservatives do as well

Yes it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around

Enemy  Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked
conservative  'always been commies always will be'

OK I should have said former enemy  I was being sarcastic about what
interventionists want to do

I suggest you
listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying
and compare that with the very antiWest slogans coming from his
opponents in the Russian congress  I sure know who I want to back

Could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a
gun

Have you considered a noninterventionist policy  If market reform does
happen Russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to
help their economy  They will even have incentive to do so for the same
reason  If they don't reform then our government will probably
consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help
them

Then their's the ideological point  We want to win Russia over to
our type of government  a type where the rulers can rule without limit
over everyone's finances

It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries Japan Germany etc with
free defense and then tradewarring with them because of the economic
competition  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke

Better to let them degenerate into civil war  Remember all those
nuclear weapons in Russia  I cannot imagine that they would not
be used in a civil war  If nationialists take over and even if
they prevent a civil war most feel they must take back large
parts of land that are in other countries like Ukraine  I also cannot
imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight possibly nuclear

How does this affect us  Well we are on the same planet and if
vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something
A massive breakup of a country that spans th the planet is
bound to have affects here  Of course there is also the
humanitarian argument that democracies should help other
democracies or struggling democracies

If a  billion gift was that important to our well being couldn't it
be raised voluntarilly  People already give over  billion a year to
charity


I ask myself what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid frivilous things with OUR money  Then I think the Constitution
was supposed to do that  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries  Seriously

Seriously  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid
My two causes are aid to Russia and a strong space program
Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies
of drunken goldfish  That is why we have a republic and not a
true democracy  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale we
only have gridlock on a congressional scale

It seems instead of gridlock on any scale we have aid to Russia
expensive space programs national charity that doesn't help the poor
and probably studies of drunken goldfish  I think limited government
is more key than how democratic it is

BTW who is to decide 'stupid'  This is just like those who
want to impose their 'morals' on others  just the sort of
thing I thought Libertarians were against

That was an opinion and libertarians are very big on free speech

Actually my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue
and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party  It seems
that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and
let it sink or swim

If you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should
be VERY libertarian  Consider it a compromise  How much money would
your fellow Russiaaiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose
weren't using the same government machine to steal money from you
and your group for causes you don't support

We could do that  years ago but not now

People have been saying that for hundreds of years

Like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and
global decision making

All the more reason to depend on the free market which can more
efficiently process information than to depend on rulers for decisions
on complex issues

dmeiercasbahacnsnwuedu Douglas Meier writes

If someone beats up a homosexual he should get charged for assault and
battery  Why must we add gay bashing to the list  Isn't this a sort of
double jeopardy  Or am I just being a fascist again

 To deter an epidemic of gay bashing that has not been deterred by
   assault laws

So we ought to make beating up a homosexual more illegal than beating up a
straight

And who's advocating that  Hate crimes laws are aimed at the motivations
of the acts  Just like premeditated homicide is treated stricter than
heatofpassion homicide

But you still get into trouble For example  how often are crimes
of violence not hate crimes The question is then who are you
hating If its another gang member then its better than if
the person you hate is of a differnt color

Also is it realistic to declare that crimes of hate are worse
than crimes of gross negligence Like random drive by shootings
where they can't be hate crimes because the shooter doesn't know
who he is going to hit  he just shoots into the crowd

 No it is not double jeopardy  A single act may lead to multiple
   charges and multiple crimes

I think what you meant to say here was With the current mutation of the US
Constitution under the current police state someone may be charged multiple
times for one act if the victim in question is of the right shade  A single
act should never merit more than on charge

So if I set off a bomb in the World Trade Center I can only be charged with
more than one murder and not the other five deaths and extensive property
damage  After all the bomb was a single act

First I heard today that there is a good chance that the US instead
of New York is going after the bombers This means no capital punishment

Secondly double jepardy does help keep the government from going after
you for first one murder then the next etc A sovereign has essentially
one chance with a single fact pattern such as the World Trade Center bombing
That is why the bombers will in all probability be tried for all the
deaths as well as the property damages as well as conspiracy at once
Of course as we discovered in the Rodney King case there are two
sovereigns neither of which can try you twice for the same crime

vengeance  That's all  It's no deterrent  It serves no

It seems to deter those who are executed from future criminal activity

Yeah yeah yeah and sure would be nice if we didn't apply the
death penalty disproportionately to minorities  I'll revisit my
opinion on the death penalty when there are more whites up for
it than blacks  Ie when hell freezes over

Why don't you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes
Blacks commit crimes disproportionately so in a perfectly fair penal
system blacks would be disproportionately represented

Note black vs white crime rates is not a racial thing  It's probably
an economic thing poor people are more likely to commit crimes and blacks
are more likely to be poor  The way to reduce the proportion of minorities
in prison is to increase the wealth of minorities

Sure I would  Why not

Seems right in character to me  creature of the state
Btw are you still happy with your presidents

 If you in government have no respect for other's faith and no respect
 for the lives and well being of those innocent children caught in this
 hell you've created  why should anyone respect your lipservice of
 rule of law

What does rule of law have to do with respect for anyone's religious
faith

See the part about the children following the and in the first line
above

As to a connection your cult is faith in rules

 No matter who the criminals are or what they've done and it looks
 like there are criminals on both sides of the matter  their
 conviction is not worth the abuse you're causing

What abuse  Please be specific

Sure My concern is the well being of the children

 If you are willing to ignore the children or heap abuse insult and
 sacrilege on the children inside the Davidian house  then GOD REBUKE
 YOU Best you learn directly from the Lord the corruption you're
 committing In GOD's good time and way the LORD judge you  I can
 not For truth be told I would send you all straight to hell  and
 GOD would be right in sending me right along with you

Oh fuck you and the God you rode in on Stephen  If you can show the
legitimacy of God's claim of sovereignty over man please do so
Otherwise stop ranting and raving about him already

 William December Starr wdstarrathenamitedu

Interesting that you would respond emotionally in defense of the
government Maybe there is a beating heart there

For the record though the biggestbaddest goverment on earth claims
the most sovereignty over man Best I can tell God allows anyone to
go to hell who wants to Omnipotency logically determines that allowing
and sending mean the same thing  Mere human concepts of course

So come on WDS Why bother to try some flimsy facade of logic Waco
proves it's not needed  the demonstration that government can walk
over it's own rules in the name of justice has been made No problem
by me Noted and announced  for the record Just giving the govern

 AM PST


	     Folks we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING
on the aid package

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Good morning  The
President  President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed
yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic
and political reform in Russia and it's valued at  billion

	     Before taking your questions and running through the
basic outlines of this package I want to make a few points
First this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do
with available funds to support Russian reform  All of the funds
have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress  There is
no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund
any of these programs  All our Fiscal Year ' funds currently
are available so in effect all of these programs can begin
tomorrow

	     The second point is that this package is designed to
support Russian reformers  All of the initiatives in the package
are directed at reformers and for their benefit and all have
been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian
government

	     Third the President is determined that we will
deliver on these commitments this year  The package is designed
to maximize our ability to support reform  In designing it we
wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet and we
feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in
front of you

	     Fourth I'd like to note the special importance of
trade and investment  I think it's fair to say that Russia's
capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend
well into the hundreds of billions of dollars  No collection of
governments can meet those needs only the private sector can do
so  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make
trade and investment a major priority in the relationship

	     They also agreed that there would be a new joint
commission on energy and space formed headed on the US side by
Vice President Gore on the Russian side by Prime Minister
Chernomyrdin  And the goal of this effort is to break through
the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote
a vastly expanded relationship

	     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down
the first page which is a summary of US assistance and just
give you some general background on what these programs are
I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions

	     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food
and medical assistance  This is part of our effort which has
been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian
grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure
there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the
major cities  That's  million in grant  that is from Food
for Progress the grant portion of Food for Progress  We'll also
be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and
pharmaceutical supplies and that's  million

	     The second item is concessional food sales  As you
know the United States has had a longterm grain relationship
with Russia  It's important to us and it's important to Russia
that we continue that relationship  The President has chosen the
Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program
The value over the next seven months is  million  These are
concessional terms  The exact terms have not been worked out
but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on
principal of six or seven years and concessional rates
thereafter for the life of the deal

	     The third program is a collection of private sector
support  We think this is one of the most important things we're
going to do  Privatization and the creation of small businesses
is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow
And so the President has decided to create a RussianAmerican
enterprise fund capitalized this year at  million  And the
goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in
Russia to take equity positions in those businesses

	     The President has also decided to create a
privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian
government in its priority objective of trying to convert state
enterprises from a stateowned basis to a private basis  He has
also agreed  the President has also agreed to establish a
Eurasia foundation  This would be a private foundation led by
prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia

	     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary
page is democratization itself  I think it's fair to say that
this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of
pursuing democratization in Russia  You see that we have a total
of  million in programs various programs  The detailed
tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're
launching

	     The President is also calling for the development of
a democracy corps which will be an overarching umbrella group to
try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public
efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in
Russia

	     The fifth program you see is Russian office of
resettlement  This is a new initiative created and
conceptualized by this administration  This is a demonstration
project  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military
to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic
states and other parts of the former Soviet Union  We want to
make sure that we work out the best way to do that whether it's
with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American
construction  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration
basis the construction of  housing units  We'll be working
very closely with the Russian military on this  And I would say
that we have a longterm commitment to this project

	     The sixth area is energy in the environment  They
are two issues that the President feels strongly about  Our
initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the
possibility of enhancing their energy production both oil and
gas and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in
the oil and gas pipeline systems which cause so much
environmental damage

	     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment
about the new group being created that the Vice President will
chair on our side  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing
with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin a business development
committee which will work in all other sectors of the economy
to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede
trade and investment  We are also going to appoint a fulltime
investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this
problem fulltime

	     And the point I'd like to make here is trade and
investment in the s is every bit as important to draw an
analogy as arms reductions was in the 's and 's  And we
just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a
commitment within our own government to have people work on it 
senior people on a fulltime basis because it is terribly
important

	     You'll notice that the United States is going to
support Russia's membership in the GATT  Russia has had observer
status  Russia has requested our support and in fact requested
our advice in becoming a member of the GATT  We think that the
longterm goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is
paramount a very important goal  And that is why we are
supporting the membership in the GATT  We are also supporting
their access to GSP the Generalized System of Preferences

	     You'll note that ExIm has extended  million in
credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia that OPIC has extended
 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil
project  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an
agreement between Russia and the United States for a billion
framework facility through the ExIm Bank that would finance
Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services
We think this is a very important development  We think we'll
get there by April th which is the opening day of the Tokyo
conference the G conference

	     Before I take any further questions I'd like to
defer to my colleague who will review the security assistance
objectives with you

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Our major
unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts
in Ukraine Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and
secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory
under the terms of the START I and START II agreements
Recently we completed in Moscow three I think very important
agreements that devote a significant chunk of NunnLugar funding
to three important programs  The first is the program of 
million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement
program  That is for submarines for ICBM dismantlement and for
bomber dismantlement   million

	     The second is a  million tranche of funding for
the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed
from the warheads as they are dismantled  This will essentially
contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the
construction of that storage facility

	     And finally a million tranche of money to help
in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear
materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system  So we
add that million total to the extant NunnLugar assistance
which has been flowing  about  million for some overall
safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety
measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the
last couple of years

	     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more
work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians Kazhaks
and Belarussians  Belarus for example has just in the last
couple of weeks received up to  million in FY' funds for
safety security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian
territory  And this was in the wake of their ratification of
START I an agreement to accede to NPT

	     So we are working very hard with all the parties to
the Lisbon protocols and will continue to work very hard with
them  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia
as a very important step in that process

	     Q	  The OPIC funds to  is that for the field in
Kazhakstan  and Conoco already signed this deal with
Kazhakstan  Why do you feel now it is necessary  if it's the
same one why do you feel it's necessary

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  It's not the same
deal  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan the Tenges oil
field  This is a new investment project  It's a polar lights
oil development and renovation project and it's being announced
today  So it's completely new

	     Q	  Can you tell us more about what's involved

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Yes  Conoco like
other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do
two things  One to prospect for new oil in Siberia west
Siberia and two to try to get into the business of renovating
oil wells and renovating pipelines both oil and gas in Russia
The objective here obviously is to take advantage of the
natural resources in Russia increase energy production which
will in turn increase hard currency revenues which is what
Russia needs

	     So we think this deal is very very good development
for Russia  The Russians do as well and it's good for an
American company  And the American government has played a
leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility
in OPIC and through the loan guarantee

	     Q	  So it's to search and also to renovate fields
that are already there

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  That's right

	     Q	  On that point should other American companies
expect to get administration support for such deals or should
they now go to the ExIm and try to get the money out of the 
billion

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Well as you know
ExIm is part of the US government and various parts of the
US government have been pushing including the State Department
and the White House for this deal to be consummated  And we
think it will  And if we arrive at this agreement by April th
there will be  billion in financing available for American
companies to sell their equipment and sell their services

	     Q	  That should take up all of the rest of the
deals and their won't be  and their will or there won't be
support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  There's a
tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas
companies to invest in Russia  We think that the ExIm oil and
gas facility the billion facility once it is concluded will
soak up a lot of that interest  But I think the interest may
even extend beyond that  And if so the government will respond

	     Q	  What's the current year budget costs of that
billion agreement should it go forward  And is there any
current year budget costs 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  I'll have to refer
you to ExIm for that  I don't know the details of that

	     Q	  The concessional food sales  is there any
current year costs to that or is it delayed until the years in
which the payments are due

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  The concessional
food sales are from Food for Progress which is a USDA program
USDA has the funds we don't need to go back to the Congress to
expend those funds  There will be a hit in the budget  I'd
refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that

	     Q	  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps

	     Q	     and the private sector  how many folks are
going to be involved in that

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Why don't I start
with the Democracy Corps first  I think the administration felt
coming into office that there were literally thousands of
organization private organizations in the United States that in
one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve
democratization in Russia helping on a farmertofarmer basis
And there were literally  or  US government agencies that
had a variety of programs in this area  And so the
administration felt  the President felt it was important to try
to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give
some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the
efforts  And so this is a presidential initiative

	     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will
soon take up his duties as the coordinator for US assistance in
the former Soviet Union  And we're very hopeful that we might
use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of
our own government but the resources of the American private
sector and schools and communities across the nation

	     Q	     any kind of commitment yet any kind of word
yet on FY' and any new money that needs to be appropriated
besides the  million the President talked about

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  The administration
is requesting additional funds in FY' of  million  What
the President has done this weekend is to consult really
intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional
measures the United States could take in some of these areas to
support reform  He'll be consulting with the Congress  When he
returns to Washington he'll be consulting also with the other
ally governments and we'll make a decision at that time

	     Q	  Two questions about the  billion
agricultural money  First of all I thought it was the sort of
consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food
So why did you decide to do it that way  Secondly could you
explain  agriculture has been stopped from making further loans
for food because of Russia's inability to pay  How does this fit
into that situation

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  As you know the
United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains
and food commodities agricultural products to Russia  I think
between  and ' we had extended  a little bit of history
here  about  billion in credits credit guarantees through
the Commodity Credit Corporation  That was the principal vehicle
to ensure the sale of American grain products  On December  of
last year ' the Russian government stopped its payments on
that program  They are now in arrears to us on that program and
therefore by law the United States cannot continue that
program  And so the President working with Secretary Espy and
other officials in the Cabinet looked for other ways that we
could promote American grain sales

	     And I think we have two ways to do that  We've
announced today  million in grant food assistance through the
Food for Progress program  But we do not have sufficient
authority to spend  million in grant food and so we looked
for a concessional loan program

	     I think everybody agrees that Russia  that a
shortterm loan program for Russia would not make sense now but
a longterm concessional loan program would  And that is what
this program is  It will provide once the final details are
worked out for a six to sevenyear grace period on payments of
principal  And then from years seven through  which is the
life of the deal it will provide for concessional rates of
interest  generally around three to four percent  And so we
believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal
for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments
and put them into the out years but it will also continue this
very important grain relationship which is important for them
and it's important for the American farm community

	     Q	  I gather from what you say that this could make
it explicit  the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC
loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through
is that right

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Let me be explicit
about that  We are prevented under the law to from continuing
the Commodity Credit Corporation shortterm credit program
because of Russia's arrearages to the United States  All of you
know about those arrearages  They total about I think around
 million  USDA can give you an exact figure  So having
taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American
market share and a longterm grain relationship wanting to
respond to a specific request from the Russian government for
major food assistance knowing that we couldn't take it from the
grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there
we looked at Food for Progress which is a program we've used to
great effect in other parts of the world  And we consulted with
the Russian government and arrived at this solution

	     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides
them with the food but also gives them a little bit of relief on
the shortterm payments

	     Q	  Where do those funds actually come from

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  They come from the
Food for Progress program which is a program under USDA's
authority  USDA has the authority to spend these funds  We do
not need to go back to the Congress for these funds  And I want
to make that general point again  Everything in this package
the  billion package comprises funds that have already been
allocated and appropriated by the Congress  The administration
can begin to spend these monies tomorrow  And it's very
important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year
that we meet these commitments  And we are confident we'll be
able to do so

	     Q	  How did you arrive at the figure of 
million  does that max out that program or did you actually
have a range from  to 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  There's a reason
for it  The reason was that the Russian government told us
that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and
harvest time  And so the idea is that we would begin the
shipments probably  million per month from now until the
harvest in the autumn at which time Russia won't require the
same level of food imports from the West

	     Q	  I would imagine there's going to be some
considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other
republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia
Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for
the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine with Georgia  with
some of the other republics

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Yes we're very
conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending
American support to the  other countries of the former Soviet
Union  We have told ourselves and we have planned that in the
area of technical assistance the grant technical assistance that
you see roughly  percent of the funding will go to Russia and
roughly  percent to the other countries

	     In the area of food sales we have been active with
Ukraine in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia  We
will continue that  And I think it's fair to say that after this
summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the
other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are
productive and they're hardhitting

	     Q	  Has anything happened at the summit to lead
American energy companies and other companies to believe that
Russia is going to be more userfriendly toward them in terms of
taxing legalities bureaucracy

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Well one of our
primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight  not
only the economic agenda but also trade and investment  And I'd
like to refer to the point I made at the beginning  We're
convinced in talking about this problem  the problem of how to
support Russia longterm  we're convinced that no collection of
Western governments have the financial resources over the next
decade to fuel the continuation of reform that only the private
sector can do that

	     We look at our own society and we see tremendous
capability in resources in the oil and gas sector  It is a very
good match with what the Russians need now which is financial
investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new
technology and new capital to finance new production

	     That's what the Russian government has told us it
wants to do and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis
on it  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on
the first day of these talks and in fact figured prominently
last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President
Clinton  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong
signal to the American business community that we support their
efforts to invest in Russia that the United States through Ex
Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce will be there to
support them

	     Q	  My question is is Yeltsin in any position to
deliver on making Russia a more 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  We think he is  I
would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister Mr
Chernomyrdin worked for  years in the Russian oil and gas
sector  He will now chair a highlevel commission with the Vice
President Vice President Gore to try to break through the
barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil
and gas sector  We believe we have a commitment to make that
committee an important committee  And we're looking forward to
the work

	     Q	  What type of mechanism is already in place to
administer the private sector portion of the program  And will
the US be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of
the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the
Russian government for distribution at their will

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Are you talking
about the variety of programs listed here  It depends on the
program itself  In most cases though we are either working
through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure
that the money obviously is well spent that the money gets to
the intended source  That's an obligation we have to the
Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can
account for the money  We have done that in the last couple of
months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of
these programs

	     But they are all quite different  For instance in
the area of grant food and medical assistance for grant food it
is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of
the food  For grant medical assistance we've been working
through Project Hope which is a private organization  For the
housing  for instance the resettlement of Russian officers
we'll be working with a group of American PBOs  On some of the
democratization projects we're working directly with Russian
private individuals and private foundations  We're working with
journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have
noticed

	     So we literally have here  to  different
activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be
carried out in slightly different ways  Some directly with the
Russian government some with Russian citizens

	     Q	  The JacksonVanik restrictions that remain and
on the COCOM restrictions that remain can you tell us what the
President has to do on that

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Well as George
noted yesterday President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in
the relationship  The President has noted that  I think it's
fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we
return to Washington and look at both of these questions and
we'll get back to the Russian government

	     Q	  You were not prepared for these questions when
you got here

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  We were prepared
for these questions  We've looked at them  But we're not
prepared to make a quick decision this weekend  They require 
let me just explain particularly on JacksonVanik  They require
consultation with the Congress  They require consultation with
the American Jewish community  And we're very sensitive to those
concerns  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before
we take any action

	     Q	  Is this package designed so that you will not
have to go to Congress for anything at this point

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  As I said at the
beginning the advantage of this particular package is that all
the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress
So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to
seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts  In
effect they can all begin tomorrow and I know that many of the
agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow  And
that's the advantage of this particular initiative

	     Q	  If this as the President says is a longterm
longhaul thing and members of Congress are at this moment
heading for Moscow why aren't you talking about going to
Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are
prepared to go to Congress for various things

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  I think we've been
clear about that  The President is discussing this weekend with
President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American
funding of additional projects and ideas that he has  We have a
major congressional delegation that left last night headed by
Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that
delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything
And we'll also want to consult with our allies  So that's where
it stands now

	     Q	  We've been told repeatedly that a number of
these items represent different or new ways of spending the money
already appropriated  Could you just tick off which of these
items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways
that it was not previously set to be

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  I think that we've
said that these are all projects that either Congress had
allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act there were
some funds that were left over from FY'  And this
administration took office and had some new ideas about how the
funds might be expended

	     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or
the FY' funds  We went into some of the agency allocations 
ExIm OPIC and USDA  and tried to look for creative ways to
further our programs

	     And example of that is the Food for Progress
concessional loans  We had hit a brick wall with another type of
funding through USDA  We could not go forward legally and so we
looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American
market share and ensure continued grain sales and we think we
found it

	     Q	  Where for example are you getting the money
for this Russian officer resettlement 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  That's from the
Freedom Support Act funds

	     Q	  In other words all of the money is being
directly spent in new ways so to speak 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Most of the grant
projects that you see  if you look at the general chart the
second chart it's broken down into grant and credits  And if
you look under grants the technical cooperation projects that
total  million  that is almost all Freedom Support Act
funding  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year
'  The NunnLugar funds of course you know about the
legislative history of those funds

	     Q	     cooperation 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  From FY '  I
don't have the exact figure  It was not a considerable figure

	     Q	  Could you tell us please has anything happened
here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and
Russia over START  for START I and II as a result of what's
happened here 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Both presidents
President Yeltsin and President Clinton will be discussing this
issue this morning  In fact we haven't yet gotten to security
and arms control related issues  That will be this morning's
session  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly
reinforcing that this is a top priority for us  We've been
talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple
of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the
discussions between them  Up to this point this has been a very
important negotiation that's been going on essentially between
Moscow and Kiev  And we are at the point now of essentially
discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute
to this discussion help to move things forward essentially

	     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend
I don't yet know  In a couple hours we'll know

	     Q	    Just a followup on the financing here  Is
any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris  since it's all current
year appropriations have you taken it from anyplace that's been
earmarked and put it into this fund

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  There are smoke and
mirrors here and I think it's an important point to note  We
could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included
outyear funding  We're going to make a longterm commitment to
many of these projects  for instance the enterprise funds the
privatization effort the housing effort  And we've already
talked to the Russians about our longterm commitment

	     We could have put in really big numbers and this
could have been a bigger package but we wanted to make a point
This package is FY '  It's funds that we have  And we're
going to do what we say we're going to do  And the President
feels very strongly about that  In the past there is a legacy
that the western governments the combination of governments put
up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not
able to meet them we're determined and the President is
determined to carry out every single program in this package
And we'll do it

	     But we do have a longerterm commitment and that's
part of the discussions on economics this weekend  We're looking
for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively
support reform  And we've told them that we do have a commitment
on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year

	     Q	     taken it way from any 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  No we haven't
Okay the question is have we reprogrammed any of these funds
so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in
Russia  The answer is no we have not done so

	     Q	  In terms of funding there is no available
monies left  and you simply find a creative way to find money
somewhere else  Doesn't that in fact support the  theory

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Not at all  I
don't think it does  That's a particular example and the
example is grain sales  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit
guarantee program was shortterm loans that Russia had to pay
back within  to  months  You all know about Russia's debt
problem and Russia was unable to meet those commitments  So we
looked for a way to do two things  to meet Russia's requirement
for grain  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale and
also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers
have a chance to sell their products to Russia  And we simply
look for another way to finance that  And we have legislative
authority to do it  This program has been successful in other
areas  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union
but we thought we should now

	     Q	  Isn't this really the BushClinton aid package
for Russia since these funds were really first derived by
initiatives put forward by President Bush

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  No I don't think
that's a fair characterization  A lot of these funds were
appropriated by the US Congress is  in   This
administration took office and inherited some obligations that
the Bush administration had made  But we had a long six to seven
week review of this program  We decided to meet the commitments
that had been made by the previous administration

	     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the
enterprise fund which was just an idea but the idea had not
been filled out with a program  There was no number attached to
it  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them
into a coherent whole in the privatization effort I would say
is another Clinton initiative

	     Further we listened to the Russian government and
listened to the Russian military who told us that the
resettlement of their officers was important to them for
political and economic and social reasons  And President Clinton
has responded to that  And we are making a longterm commitment
that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out
a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers

	     I would also say that the President has given
impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly
about what it is we can do on democratization because there we
have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends
itself to the Russian experience  And in calling for the
creation of a democracy corps which is another new initiative
we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private
sector as well as the American government to achieve that
objective

	     So I would not characterize it that way at all  And
as most of you know I am a career civil servant  I was in the
last administration  I'm very familiar with what the last
administration did  And I would characterize this as a Clinton
assistance package for Russia

	     Q	  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the
past has not gotten to the people  Is there anything in this
outside of the ombudsman that will guarantee that this money
will not just disappear because it's being administered by the
Russian government

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  I think that  I
know that the President and other senior officials of our
government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and
that it get to the source that it's intended  for which it's
intended  And so we're going to take great care  AID and the
State Department will take great care in making sure that the
funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their
source

	     I would not that this package is not simply a
package of support solely to the Russian government  Some of
these projects especially in democratization and exchanges are
going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals
with businesses  The private enterprise support is another
example of that

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  If I could just add
a word on this point with regard to the SSDrelated programs one
area that we've been looking at very very closely is
consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting
for these kinds of programs  They would be working very closely
of course with the American firms who would be the prime
contractors  But this is a fine example I think of a more of
a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that
funding down to the grassroots level down to the ground in
Russia but at the same time ensuring that it is spent
efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended

	     Q	  When would the democracy corps start  Exactly
when do you see this happening  How would get it off the ground

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Well the President
is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps  I think
it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over
the next couple of weeks  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties
on May st  But in effect we've already started because over
the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach
out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us
to help facilitate their activities in Russia  And we've said
that we will be helpful  We've also tried to kind of coordinate
in a much more effective way the activities of our own
government  We do have  or  agencies that are active in
Russia in one way or another  We think it makes sense to draw
them together and to focus their efforts

	     Q	  Excuse me  How much of this  billion will
actually be spent in the United States by American made goods

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  I don't have any
figures for you now but perhaps we could try to work something
up in the next couple of days on that

	     Q	  This figure is larger than the figure that has
been in the press  did this program grow yesterday as a result
of the discussions or have we just been that far off the mark

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  No I think 
unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark and
I'm sorry to say that  No this package  President Clinton put
us to work about seven weeks ago on this package  And he was
briefed intensively on this  He contributed a lot of the
intellectual leadership in this package  He contributed a lot of
the ideas in the package  And I think it's fair to say that we
had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago  We have
been refining it ever since  We spent a couple of days last week
going over it with the Russian government both the embassy in
Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy
And so it's been evolving  But this particular package has been
together for about two weeks

	     Q	  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then  There
was so much talk before about the President wanted to get
Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth
Is that in the out years

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  No it's both
President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us for instance
that support for the creation of private businesses is important
to him that the resettlement of Russian military officers is
important and that first and foremost the effort to privatize
the state industries is important to them

	     And so what we did was to try to make those the
centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package  We
listened to him  On the privatization effort we have been
working with the Russian government for months on this trying to
work out all the details  So the Russian government on most of
these programs was involved every step of the way

	     But let me get at the other part of your question
The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader
set of initiatives that we might undertake  And we're looking
for his ideas  The President has brought his own ideas to the
table  for instance on energy and the environment and in
housing  But we're looking for Russian ideas not  We need to
consult with the Congress and we need to consult with the other
allied governments that are also active

	     Q	  There's essentially nothing that happened in
the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that
you came in with

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  This particular
package as I said was worked out and was ready about two weeks
ago  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on
the final stages of its development and so this weekend we've
primarily talked about future about what more the United States
and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia
which is our base objective here

	     Q	  I noticed that you  that money appropriated
to train bankers and businessmen and officers  Can you tell me
what about job training for workers who are displaced by
privatization

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  You're right we
have a program to train Russian  young Russians in banking and
financial services in the United States  Part of the housing
initiative it's not just to build housing units it's to retrain
Russian officers who are retiring into other professions

	     Q	     money for job training for workers whose
jobs are disappearing because of privatization 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  We have not yet
allocated any money for that

	     Q	  Why not

	     Q	     of the  million is going to build 
housing units  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the
Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  If you want to do
housing the right way it's not just the building the framework
of a house you've got to think about all the utilities  You've
got to think about the purchase of land  You've got to think
about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth  And it's also
retraining  It's not enough to put retired  an officer coming
out of  Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia
We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers
as well  This is responding to a request from the Russian
government

	     Q	     of the  million will go to retrain 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  That's right

	     Q	  Are you talking about apartment buildings or
single 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  We're talking about
single individual dwellings

	     Q	  You're saying that only  families will be
served by this

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  What I want to  I
thought I pointed out earlier this is a demonstration project
What we didn't want to do  given the experience that the
Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building
housing in western Russian we did not want to leap into it with
a huge amount of money  What we want to do is work over the next
couple of months and try to figure out with American
organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job
done

	     I noted that we have a longterm commitment to that
And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into
this in the future   But we want to do it wisely we want to
spend the money wisely

	     Q	  What is it about this program that convinces
you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be
in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back
especially considering their other debt problem

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Well look I think
it's important to note that the United States on its own does not
have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform
It's got to be a collective Western effort and we're looking to
our allies to do more as well  But beyond that it's really what
the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform  We
can simply play a role and we feel we have an obligation to do
so which is consistent with our national interests

	     Q	  Did the President say that the value of the
US contribution was that it would create security and
prosperity for the United States  So what is it about this
program that does this

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  I think you have to
go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia
and that is we want to do everything we can to support the
continuation of reform  We are convinced that if reformers stay
in power then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear
forces foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction
which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in
Russia  So it's not a simple question  You can't just say that
this program is the answer  It's a longterm question and we
have to make a longterm commitment to it

	     Q	  And then on the question of Russia's ability to
repay what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 
years from now

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  Well the Russian
government has made a commitment to repay and what we're hoping
is that if reform continues and if they can continue to improve
their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency
revenues that Russia will be in a position six or seven years
from now to pay back those loans

	     Q	     substantial governmenttogovernment loan
we've ever gotten into with the Russians

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  I don't want to
answer authoritatively on that  I don't go back  or  years
on this  But in the last four or five years yes it is because
the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to
just ensure private bank loans  This is a different type of
effort

	     Q	     government loans in any other sector that
you recall  I know it wasn't done in 

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL  I think it's fair
to say this is a new and unique effort

by Not a Boomerdesirewrig


    The deficits declined from  reaching a low of  of GNP before
 the tax and spending hike of  reversed the trend

 Brett
Is this true   Some more details would be appreciated

Yes sadly this is true The primary reason and the essence of the
details that you are seeking is that the GrahmRudman budget controls
were working  In fact they were working so well that unless the feds
did something they were going to have to start cutting pork So Bush
and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced
GrahmRudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush
consented to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending
increases

As it turned out the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps
on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as
President so that he could create his own new plan with more tax
increases

The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level
ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office

Chew on that awhile

BTW I'm a WALC white aryan lapsed catholic


d'baba Duane M Hentrich        babaTymnetCom

   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr Hentrich calling
himself an Aryan  The word Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first
in the Hindu scripture the Rigveda  It seems to have been a tribal term
but may have had connotations of good character  Such connotations
are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the
eightfold Aryan path   The word was borrowed by the German scholar
Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for indoeuropean' but then the
Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that aryan' is
synonymous with nordic' which seems highly unlikely  The people who
originally called themselves aryas  the Iranians Noprth Indians the Afghans
and possibly the Kurds are none of them nordic  So the use of the word
by Westerners though meant with apparent good humor in this case is
nontheless inappropriate  The only Westerners who may have some claim
to call themselves Aryans by descent are the Celts who seem to have wor
shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda

  If you want to check what I am saying look at  Mallory's book In
search of the IndoEuropeans or just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica
The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature
as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and
for Westerners to butt in is really not nice not to mention the horrible
things done by Germans to Jews using a word to which the Germans have
no clear claim

ajteeldendritecsColoradoEDU

  No they must be working they are getting lots of these 'complaints'
that they are not funny  Keep 'em coming it they weren't funny or
bothering them they'd just ignore them

If a six year old child does a funny trick and you say well done he will
do it again and it may be funny Then they may repeat it over and over
again bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it isn't any
more Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing
the same thing over and over again isn't funny any more

Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass He does not
make jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule
their target Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you put
on a red nose while you say it it was a good debating point used on the
spur of the moment  months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the
user couldn't think of anything original to say


In the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinner
guests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns Ed is clearly one
of this type of people who fails to see when a joke is spent

  If someone beats up a homosexual he should get charged for assault
  and battery  Why must we add gay bashing to the list  Isn't this a
  sort of double jeopardy  Or am I just being a fascist again
  Douglas Meier

 Assuming the questions are not rhetorical the answers are

  To deter an epidemic of gay bashing that has not been deterred by
    assault laws
  No it is not double jeopardy  A single act may lead to multiple
    charges and multiple crimes
  Yes

Let's leave aside the personalinsult potential that Doug created by
asking his last question and just concentrate on the legalpolitical
debate  Last point first yes a single act may lead to multiple
independent charges  However as a side note I think that the
prohibition on double jeopardy mandates that the suspect be tried on all
those charges at the same time in the same trial  Unless of course
the government can pull the separate sovereignties crock that they're
using on those four LAPD cops who arrested Rodney King ie trying a
person who's already been acquitted in state court on federal charges
arising from the same act  I think that this is double jeopardy but
apparently the courts don't agree with me

Note that the laws that don't agree with you were passed to protect
a class of people who couldn't get justice from the state courts
specifically civil rights workers in Missisippi in the 's The
federal protection of individual rights supersedes the nonfeasance
of the state Something similar has long been traditional  well
he's queer so I beat him up for gays



You pays your money and you takes your pick me I lean strongly
towards the against argument  I know that having the law treat
everyone as equals regardless of realities will not in and of itself
lead to true equality and in fact may lead at times towards greater
inequality  Nonetheless I believe that true equality is at least
possible when the laws treat people as being equal while true
equality is by definition impossible when the laws themselves
mandate unequal treatment of classes of people by the state

 William December Starr wdstarrathenamitedu

As Anatole France said The law in its impartial majesty forbids the
rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges

Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways For example
the fact that all property thefts regardless of value are not
punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have
a lot of money from having it stolen You could easily define
equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance
for the owner This would a form of equality that would be skewed
toward poorer people

In fact most antigay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal
protection They make it an offense to damage people based on a
motivation of hatred for sexual orientation Thus the law in its
impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed
I'm sure that's a great relief to Douglas Meier

 A parallel Q Is a person of color a human being
             A You'll have to define what you mean by human being'

To answer your irrelevant question yes a person of color is human
but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have
merely begged the question without responding  By trying to inject
the notion of race into the discussion you muddy the waters without
adding any insight whatever  The same parallel question could
be Is a polydactyl person a human being  You still have not
answered what you mean by human being  Please do so

  I would suggest that legal precedent defines a human being ie a person
  whose rights are protected by the Constitution and the law as someone with
  a functioning brain
 Could you cite some of those precedents for me or the basis of this
 definition  While the law does allow the removal of extraordinary
 means of sustaining life in cases of brain death this in itself
 does not lead to your conclusion of how the law defines a human
 being  However at least you defined human being in a tenuous
 fashion  That is a person whose rights are protected by the
 Constitution and the law

 For my answer to your question I refer you to Roe v Wade and
 subsequent Supreme Court decisions which define to what
 extent a fetus is protected by the Constitution and the law
 Certain judges have concurred that slavery is not a violation of
 human rights therefore it is not

You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies
If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on
the vagaries of law but holds solid whatever the law may rule
provide it for me

 I would suggest that your blind faith would not likely hold up if the
 shoe were on the other foot  The brain lifedeath paradigm is one that
 I suggest as one consistent with other legal definitions  It clearly
 doesn't matter to you whether an unborn child has any rights or not
 however so the point is lost on you

More irrelevancies  As Larry Margolis pointed out the law
has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses but does
not follow your version of human being  And as he pointed out
brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights
of the living but rather who has died  There is a significant
difference

What I am wondering now is has your argument so failed you that
you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the
thread you started  You got answers to your questions when
you began baiting me if you recall after you had made some
ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and having been corrected
changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion
of substance  If you really wanted a discussion of substance
why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss
silly accussations eg It really doesn't matter to you
If it matters to you then why not define human being and seek
some substance  You're not going to convince a logical person
of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic
and show some meaning to your words

            If she is then why does the mother have the right to kill
              her when she is in the womb but not after she has passed
              through the birth canal
 
  Because a woman has a right to have any object which threatens her
  health and is within the confines of her body removed  The other
  side of the argument would give rights to the fetus that would not
  be granted to an adult human  If for example you were occupying
  the body of another for whatever reason or through whatever means
  the reason and means being irrelevant that other would be able to
  remove or have you removed  If that removal required your demise
  I see no reason in law that such a removal could not be effected
  Rather than examining a hypothetical thought experiment let us examine
  a real though rare situation siamese twins  If one siamese twin has
  the other surgically removed knowing that it will cause death and
  barring some emergency where they will both die anyway it is
  murder
 Is it  Have you any support for this assertion  Furthermore your
 analogy is completely inapplicable  Siamese twins have an equal
 claim to any body parts they have in common  Try again
 What establishes this equal claim beyond your assertion  If it
 is merely a matter of which came first cannot one kill the other since
 they both have equal claim  What if one has more motor control than
 the other  Does that establish a superior claim

As others point out one is sacrificed for the other depending on
which has the better chance at survival  Again your analogy
fails  Not precedence but possession makes a difference here
A woman's womb is indisputably her own  Also I see you ignore
my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would
not be granted a born human being  Was that due to its inconvenience

  You see the right to life IS granted to adult humans in the
  same sense as it should be to the foetus AT SOME POINT PRIOR TO BIRTH
 Are Siamese twins ever separated in the womb  Or is this
 right you assert for Siamese twins which I don't even think is
 true as stated or valid as an analogy one that exists after birth
 Freivald your entire argument here is a failure
 Interesting way of trying to combine two essentially orthogonal concepts
 The point is that it is murder for one siamese twin to kill the other
 regardless of their status of physiological dependence or interdependence

Is it  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling

 It would be difficult for one siamese twin to kill the other inside the
 womb and even if it were possible I doubt that a case could be made for
 premeditation or neglegence  Note the use of the phrase it should be
 in my post

You simply assert things without any support  Your analogy is
not accurate and your assertions are unsupported  Try this on
for size  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill
the other in the womb  There  We now have equal arguments
But the idea is illogical  For one Siamese twin to kill the
other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well  The
systems are dependent on each other for life  I'm still struggling
to see anything analagous here and failing to do so

  Of course the situation is NOT a perfect comparison it may well be that
  one siamese twin deliberately initiates oppression or coersion against
  the other  This is clearly not the case with an unborn child
 And this last statement from you is a total non sequitur  The
 comparison is far worse than you give it credit for
 Are you going to let this assertion stand on its own also or do you
 plan on following up with a reasoned argument

Your argument is from Fantasy Island  Your comparison is a total
failure as I have demonstrated already and has no basis in
reality neither legally nor medically  And for you to assert
that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible
that of coercion or oppression is ridiculous  As I said
you give the analogy too little credit for failure  On the one
hand you start this by saying you want to take a real rather than
a hypothetical situation then you fly off into Siamese twins
murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each
other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe
in now way matches your version  As I said before decisions
are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where
they cannot both survive  And furthermore as I have already said
there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim
that is unequal  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a
claim on a woman's womb  When the fetus is born what happens to
its claim  And by what reason do you assert its claim

            If a parent has the right to choose to not take responsibility
              for their own child why are there laws and penalties against
              child abandonment
  This last question is irrelevant and something of a non sequitur
  Can you establish some relevance or even some sense for it
  If at some point an unborn child is a human being the parents clearly
  have the same responsibilities toward her as any other parents have toward
  their children
 Again what is the relevance  You have established no sense of when
 that point is you ignore the significant difference between a fetus
 and a born child the dependence of a born child can be transferred
 to another party while that of a fetus cannot a born child does
 not live within the body of another human being while a fetus does
 thereby representing potential and often actual harm to that
 body as in the case of one of our talkabortion participants who
 suffers from epilepsy and to whom pregnancy represents a significant
 health risk or as in the case of a woman I know who chose to
 continue her pregnancy but spent her entire pregnancy confined to
 a wheelchair and suffering great pain from constriction of some
 nerve and your argument is not an argument against abortion
 generally but at best an argument against abortion at some
 time during the course of pregnancy
 Again a quest for common ground  Most of the prochoice people I
 have spoken to in person none of them proabortion activists concede
 that the child has a right to life at some point that supersedes all
 of the mother's rights except that of her own life  As is often the
 case in emotionally charged issues the activists have a very different
 outlook from the mainstream

You haven't answered the question  The situations are not analagous

 The dependence of a born child is not transferred instantaneously it
 takes time and effort  Incidentally it is the prochoice side not
 me arguing that the government should make it easy for parents to
 abandon their children to the State

Again you avoid the question  Dependence can be transferred and
it is not as slow as you seem to think

 As to the anecdotal evidence of real human tragedy there is ample
 on both sides  I would hate to be in the position of the mother in
 NYC who has to tell her daughter that she lost her arm in a botched
 abortion attempt

Yes and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that
he was murdered by a religious prolife fanatic  Please do
try to stay relevant

 The kindest thing I can say about these responses of yours is
 that I can see you are trying to say something but the result
 is a mishmash of negligible value
 Sez you

Clever comeback  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit

 Ground covered in another post deleted

  If at some point an unborn child is a human being the parents clearly
  have the same responsibilities toward her as any other parents have toward
  their children
 
  And no parent can be forced to supply bodily resources toward their children
  even if necessary to save the child's life

 As was this  To make it painfully clear you are not
 obligated to donate a kidney to save your child's life
 under law

 Again the confusion between ACTION deliberately taking away the life
 of a child and INACTION refusing to run out in front of a bus to save
 a child

What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake
Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her
kidney when previously the parent did not by your standards  What
is different about the two situations  I see I have to spell this
out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you  In the one
case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born
child you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus
can and in this case you recognize a significant difference
between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at
stake  You can't have it both ways  Action and inaction are
irrelevant to the principle but you are wrong about the inaction
anyway  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have
borne children how inactive their pregnancy was  To have a
healthy live child a woman does more than hang out eat as
she chooses plays volleyball like she always did drinks at
parties with her friends etc  She behaves very differently and
the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary
than the beating of her heart but it is far from inactive

 No if you want to use legal precedent you should take a look at the
 Model Penal Code on which many states base their criminal code

 My apologies if I was unclear I was not trying to start a statutory
 debate since there are many in some cases conflicting statutes on
 the books  I was merely suggesting a paradigm that might make sense
 for a prochoicer IMHO

Cite one of these conflicting statutes  You keep making
these assertions but you haven't supported any of them yet
I am speaking of statutes that conflict with the definition
Larry posted

Why did you delete the code that Larry posted

Also the Model Penal Code made perfect sense to me  Were you
perhaps confused by it

Also I am still looking for your definition  The one you used
clearly indicates that a fetus is not a human being

 This is not likely to please either prolifers or
 prochoicers but it is pretty clear from the legalmedical concept of
 brain death
 Brain death is a method of deciding when a known person is legally
 dead there's no analogous concept of brain birth
 I have just coined it  You may object to the paradigm but it would
 make our treatment of human life statutorily consistent

Circular arguments are usually very consistent

           If a parent has the right to choose to not take responsibility
             for their own child why are there laws and penalties against
             child abandonment

 even if necessary to save the child's life
 There is a confusion here between action and inaction a parent does not have
 to run out in front of a bus to save their child's life either but a parent
 IS required to feed his children


Again your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit
your needs  The principle of protecting life is abandoned based
on action versus inaction  Not much of a principle  Suddenly
you recognize that the claim on bodily resources is dependent
on circumstances other than this principle of life  That's
a very conevnient principle you have there Matt

In article CzJBFFdscomsadesyde hallamzeusdesyde writes
A State is defined by its ability to create laws ergo when the state is not
able to make laws we are not talking about a fully functioning state

There are always some areas on which the state is able to make and
enforce laws and some on which it is not  To add some relevance to
the group in which I happen to be reading this the US government
circa  could not have created laws such as present Federal
guncontrol legislation  Was it not a state

Yes because it has always had that power The constitution limits the areas
in which the government can exercise power The constitution can be changed
however and has been frequently For example during prohibition the
government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state had
the capacity to change the constitution to enable this

The constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictate
the manner in which power is exercised No piece of paper can prevent
abuse for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidate
for opposing world war I  a clear breach of the first ammendment

The United States clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful arms
control measures If there were large groups of powerful warlords who could
prevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the power
of the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited This
is the situation in Somalia where the state is unable to govern because
the people with the guns think that they have the right to decide the
law


You have a very confused notion of what a state is A modern state is a
governing body In the period you describe there is no lasting instance of
a period where there was law without a governing body to enforce that law

Of course there was no effective law without enforcement  But
saying that a state is a governing body does not mean that it is
the only sort of a governing body unless one plays semantic games
like if a state didn't create it it's not really a law

The problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is which
date from the treaty of Westphalia to the medieval period where countries
were much more analogous to bodies like the EEC or the UN  organisations
where individual members had significant powers in their own right and
did not derive their power from a central authority

 The
canonical example of nongovernmental law is probably the Law
Merchant which others can expound upon better than I  But it was
certainly enforced in nonstate courts for some time although state
courts being subsidized later were able to effectively enter the
arbitration business

But here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary The rules
and regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state
was not involved in Even today a great deal of law is effectively
made in this manner For example the city of London stockmarket which is
a non governmental body that can make and enforce rules It does so however
within the framework laid down by the government

In medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner If
you were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw the
monarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very short
time Most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit Royal
Charters such as the Universities for example Fairs and towns all required
authority in order to trade It was customary however for this authority
to be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case of
misbehavior After Magna Carta the monarch lost the power to remove
privillage without recourse to the courts Tony Benn recently established
through a devious route the power of the Parliament to revoke favours
without recourse to the courts  thus establishing the right to abolish
the house of lords for example

Certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the
common law which has a very specific meaning in the UK It is law
made by the judiciary through judgements on cases Nothing else is
common law


Incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect For
example a judgment in common law made in England can effect the
interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once in
the Empire including the US the reverse is also true For example a
lot of the decisions surrounding AIDS cases in the US are of relevance
to UK decisions Although the statues are different the reasoning that
lies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus if
a judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law in
one jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with no
guiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime which
they might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal The law
should be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions without
precedent Once a decision is made in the UK though that naturally is
superior in UK law

     In case you missed it on the newsthe first  Haitians
of many that tested positive for HIV and were being held on a
base in Cuba have been flown to the US
     Further a US judge has ruled that they must receive
medical treatment or be returned to a place where they could
receive same

      So guess what folks we taxpayers get to pick up the tab
just as you might have expected for people who have never
contributed a dime to the US society

      I think this government has its priorities ALL SCREWED UP
If they want to help Haitianshow about removing the illegal
government how about giving them development aid
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE to waste resources on dying noncitizens
who will never be productive in either this country or their own
It does not make sense when the same resources applied or even
just plain given to poor people in Haiti could significantly
help  people in Haiti per  AIDSinfected noncitizen immigrant

In article CxHJLcuphpcom decuphpcom Dan Epstein writes

 territory   Still it might be possible to subject this theory to something
 like a controlled experiment as Chomsky demonstrates by comparing how
 the American press treated two contemporaneous cases of mass
 slaughter in Cambodia and in East Timor The Cambodian genocide
 carried out by bad guys as defined by the State Department and
 corporate interests met with loud and frequent denunciations The
 East Timor genocide carried out by Indonesian good guys went
 almost unreported So Chomsky as a good scientist verifies his
 hypothesis  all the while hoping we may assume not to see the
 experiment repeated too often

	Is Chomsky thus equivacating the genocide in Cambodia with the invasion
and occupation of E Timor

	If so how does he rationalize that

He is claiming that what the Indonesians are up to in East Timor is genocide

Certainly what is going on is serious enough that it is way above the threshold
where it should be brought to attention Pol Pot did not kill nearly as many
people as Hitler but he is most certainly as evil


	If so how does he explain away the difference between an intended
goal of genocide Cambodia and a brutal occupation

He fully accepts the differences in the intentions and situations What he
is saying is that the effect in both cases has been mass murder only we
only get to hear about the one that supports the red scare merchants and the
behaviour of our allies is conveniently ignored

A starker comparison is in El Salvador where the allegations that the left
were repeatedly making throughout the s have been proven with the
discovery of mass graves There was evidence enough at the time that Duarte
and his gang of thugs were mass murderers but Regan and Bush ignored it
and gave them arms to repress the opposition This must be contrasted with
the events in Nicaragua where no evidence of Sandinista attrocities such
as mass murder of political opponents has come to light since they lost
the democratic elections that they held Despite this the Nicaraguan regime
was held to justify the funding of a terrorist war fought mainly against
civillians by the infamous contras


	If so why isn't he in Australia chanting no blood for oil

Have you any reason to beleive he isn't

 So how do you feel about increased penalties for killing a policeman
 A federal employee  Or to use both Scalia's and Stevens's example
 increased penalties for threatening the president  I'm assuming
 that like all good people you oppose the marital exemption for rape
 so I won't bring that up

In order of your questions I oppose it I oppose it I oppose it and
Huh  Wha  Where did that topic come from and what's it got to do
with the discussion at hand 

When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes
against different classes of people and yes I do consider laws which
allowmandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category the category of classes I had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion  classes based upon race gender
ethnicity religion sexual orientation etc  Having you ask about
classes based upon one's profession rather than one's personal
characteristics caught me off guard and I had to think out the question
from scratch

What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others and that would be anathema
to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law

Last year when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fiftyplus
crimes including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that aura of deterrence critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher when the latter arguably provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society
This was an emotionally compelling argument but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their
contribution to society  I view that doctrine as being both a
personally repugnant and b repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of
the th Amendment

Accordingly I believe that there should be no laws which give any
professionbased class of people special protection via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class not even police officers federal officers or highranking
members of the Executive Branch of the federal government

  GovernmentMandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful
  Study Finds

While I agree with much of this post one point seems misdirected

    When standards of living population densities and industrial
  structures are controlled for the United States is no less energy
  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group
  of Seven nations

And when controlled for usage of oil gas etc energy efficiency in
all countries turns out to be identical 

To take population density as an example one way to reduce energy
used in transportation is surely to concentrate the population in
dense urban areas though this might of course have other
disadvantages possibly even relating to energy use  The fact that
Japan is forced to do this by the nature of the country while the US
is not does not mean that people in the US would be unable to do this
if given sufficient motive to conserve energy

Jack I happen to be Jewish and have some serious problems with the whole
situation in Israel But your exaggerations and commentary certainly don't help
to support your viewpoint Here for example you are conflating two separate
stories and exaggerating both of them

If I have confused two different stories it was an honest mistake but I do
not see why it becomes an exageration of either  They both took place and

Both events took place but not as you described them It feels trivial to
nitpick about details like this and insulting to everyone involved
But I feel that the truth is more damning than an exaggeration and
much more likely to cause people to think when they read it

In general when I read an argument that uses inaccurate and inflamatory
statements honest mistake or not I tend to dismiss the entire argument
because of those errors

The entire situation in the Middle East is too important to reduce to
backandforth propaganda  it is precisely this reduction that further
polarizes the situation and makes peace understanding and reconcilliation
impossible

are both equally disgusting behavior for any country let alone one that
brags constantly about democracy

Agreed It would have been better if both situations could have been avoided

I accidently deleted the line about how it would be better if more of
 YOU PEOPLE would do something about disgust and closets

What's this YOU PEOPLE stuff anyway How does it contribute to a
rational discussion of the issues

in the closet  we wouldn't be having this discussion

Having said you have my heartfelt thanks and admiration for even saying
what you have said already  I suspect you will be getting more  hate
mail than support

Frankly I've received no mail on the subject hateful or supportive

it may be a little late to reply to your tirade and also on an inaapropriate
board but along with all of the so called great things the white male has done they have also contributed to society by means of mass genocide the theft of
ideas and cultures creating and the perptration of historical lies throughouttime among many other horrible activities
but every culture has its upside and its downside  it seems to me that the
white male must be extremely ignorant to qualify for the following  if
you're not disregard and western culture are the only things that look to
actively classify things as good or bad worthy or unworthy ya dig
it can be seen with slavery and the manipulation and destruction of the
american indians civilization  nothing but selfish acts that benefit one
group of people and not even their women get or got respected or regarded as
equal  ain't that some stuff

white men  not being specific  but in a lot of cases are just wack or have
wack conceptions of how the world is to serve their purpose

just look at david koresh  throughout history i may be shortsighted on this one so excuse my predjudiced ignorance only white men associate themselves withbeing GOD  no other culture is ignorant or arrogant enough to assume such a
position  and then to manipulate and mislead all those people

hmmm  i'd say look in your history books but since it seems that history
has been written to glorify the exploits of white men you'd only find lies

awww that's enough already from me because this has nothing to do with sex or this board  if ya'd like to continue this discussion email me and we can
compare and contrast ideas

			i like conflict  it's educational when the
			communcation is good

 The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level
 ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office

Which considering the amount Bushcongress added to it would be a
notinconsiderable achievement

While we're on the subject I also believe that the supplyside claim that
reducing taxes raised revenue is also false because they typically factor in
SocSec taxes which were raised a considerable amount at the same time that
income taxes were cut  If you look at income tax revenue alone it fell after
after the cuts began and didn't recover for several years By then record
deficits were well entrenched

 Chew on that awhile

 	Is Chomsky thus equivacating the genocide in Cambodia with the invasion
 and occupation of E Timor

 I think the word you have in mind is equating  And no Noam Chomsky
 is considerably too intelligent to think that history ever repeats
 itself exactly  He has said however repeatedly that the two acts
 were of comparable brutality and should receive comparable
 condemnation  There's a good case to be made that he's right what's
 happened and is happening in East Timor is considerably worse than
 most Americans realize  This is in part because there are very few
 stories about East Timor in the mainstream press

	Ok as far as that goes I agree  The situatio in E Timor does deserve
the attention that Bosnia Angola etc get  ButI also think that the
press can't be forced to print articles air shows about it etc
	The religious right got tired of the mainstream media and started
buying their own stationspapers  The left should do the same thing instead of
relying on NPR and public stations

 	If so how does he explain away the difference between an intended
 goal of genocide Cambodia and a brutal occupation

 I don't think that anyone can ever say for sure what the intended
 goal of the Khmer Rouge was  What we can do though is look at
 their actionsand those actions have been quite horrible both those
 of the Khmer Rouge and of the Indonesian occupiers  I don't think
 that the word genocide is too strong to apply to either situation

	I wouldn't venture that far to say the situation in E Timor is
genocide  The Indonesians seem perfectly willing to not kill anyone who
doesn't get in their way which is something the Khmer Rouge didn't do
Virtually everyone not in the Khmer Rouge suffered the killing fields
	Once again not to downplay the violence in Timor

 	If so why isn't he in Australia chanting no blood for oil

 Probably because he thinks that this form of protest would be silly
 and ineffective  Or is that explanation too obvious

	I don't agree  Right now Australia is the most effective lever against
Indonesia  They are negotiating for oil drilling rights off Timor and
stopping that process would go a long way towards making Indonesia realize that
people don't want to see the situation swept under the rug

  cheers

 Actually not  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously
 What declined from  to  as I remember it was percent
 increaseindeficitgrowth ie the rate of growth of the deficit
 nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time decreased

	Would you please define nth derivative of debt  Last time I asked
you seem to have disappeared

	And it's the deficits themselves that came down to  of GNP  The
numbers are posted in the previous posting

 Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
 declined

	Cute Paul but with no numbers you still look foolish

 If you keep spending more than you earn the deficit keeps
 growing

	Paul like many others is confusing the deficit with the debt

 If you keep borrowing at a lesser rate than you borrowed
 previously the deficit increases  You only decrease deficits when your
 income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts

	Not in terms of GNP the one universally accepted measure of deficits
at least among rigorous economists 


 arguments were brilliant  He confirmed with data what many of us know
 with common sense  the boom of the 's has nothing to do with government
 policy particularly supply side policy since taxes do not cause
 economic activities  People cause economic activity  More can be

	Semantics  Lindsey proves otherwise  Taxes make people change their
economic activities

 explained by watching population waves roll through the years and
 create cycles  He has made models and predictions for years well into

 is

     But this does not imply that ALL relationships between youth
     and adults are exploitative and abusive

The critical factor here is whether the sexual activity is forced
or whether it is an activity that is consensually agreed upon and
freely engaged in by the people involved

When a child is forced there is often damage on the other hand

	Wholeheartedly agree here

consensual relationships are often found to be positive experiences
for all concerned

	Why do I find this hard to believe
	Care to convince us

Carlos

   Why not check out some of the scientific research that has been
done in this area and convince yourself

   Research around the world indicates that the issue of coercion is
the critical factor

For those interested in research on the topic I can suggest Li et al
England Constantine United States and Sandfort The Netherlands
I especially like Sandfort's research for he actually quotes what the
boys who are involved in the relationships have to say

Well well well Thanks to eckpanixcom Mark Eckenwiler and
thfkimbarkuchicagoedu Ted Frank my account is to be axed
I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult
for them to deal with They ONLY Ted and Mark have complained to my
sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net In his
defense Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad it has
been posted in one of the newsgroups However it was not directed
at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding
via netmail

While I disagree with Ted I would not send mail to his sysadmin
to get him axed Namecalling was not enough jumping on every post
I made was not enough ignoring specific points when they were not
what the desired picture was not enough SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I
AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH Even now I do not wish to have him
axed but I do wish to express my disgust about this Argumentum
ad silenceyouropponentum I would have thought he would have
wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and
seem sooo wise to himself I think

The issue that seems to be Is the following an advertisement
Apparently Ted and Mark think so

 I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken
	off the net from last year If reposting an article
	constitutes posting an ad then I am guilty This post
	did have a name and address and yes a price If one
	had posted the address and subscription price of Newsweek
	would that be an ad I get nothing from showing this stuff
 I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of
	proof that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK He then complains
	to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and lo and
	behold poof there goes my account This one had an
	address in it Oh no I Guess that means it is an ad

If you value the alternative view I have been discussing or VALUE
ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it I ask that you send
a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin They rarely get
Ya know that user on your net was real helpful or whatever they
only get I don't like what that user is doing because
Please do not send the note to the sysadmin I need to take it to them
in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through

In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying Thanks for
the info or Could you send me such and such or Your posts are
very interesting keep it up and only a handfull of Go aways But
I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to
convince Ted is a Net OffenseTM of such magnitude as to warrant
a message complaining about me Knock knockMy name is Ted and
and this is Mark We're from the thought police Seems you have
some pretty dangerous ideas here and we're here to confiscate them
NWO Indeed

Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with
a new plan Thanks Ted and Mike Hope you are happy
I will be on for a few more days and then that's all folks
Your comments and support are requested I can no longer post
to news I ask what this has accomplished Is there some benefit
from making alternative views simply vanish Not in my book
Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side
shut up Images of Waco ah but alas And all this when I am in the
process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that
a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction
Oh well It takes time to come up with the info requested and I
was just getting started

It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 
times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the
contrary Further what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed
We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people
on the net that are of interest to the government and Ted sure seems
to have a personal interest in debunking me Hmmm just who does
he work for The University of Chicago which he attends is well
known as one of the biggest NWO supporters

And finally if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here
in the BoulderDenver area I would greatly appreciate it I am in the
process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe
a TCIP connection Any help here would be greatly appreciated Since I
am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY
soon I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via

       I am having trouble reaching the following keeps bouncing
       If you sent me mail and haven't gotten a response check here
       Also can anyone tell me why these are bouncing I used

Editor's Note The reason for posting the header lines from the bounced
messages was to show what the problem was and hopefully correct it

Ted Frank It's inexcusable to post  lines of bounced mail headers to four
newsgroups
    A simple fourline post would have been sufficient

Lazlo
yes i agree BUT our policy is to not watch everypost someone  here
makes
we generally let the net itself take care of inappropriate postings
by flaming the user into shape which i assume this is ment to be
we CS operations don't like to get involved in this stuff unless
its illegal repetitive posts of gig gifs harassment or something
else that offends the community in general my suggestion is that
you take it to email and explain what a post for bounces should look
like or tell him to RTFM

Editor's note Obviously Ted had no such intention of doing so

ted frank                  However Teel should have mentioned that though
thfkimbarkuchicagoedu   his advice is legally sound if you follow it
the u of c law school       you will probably wind up in jail

	I would have thought you would have found better means
of refuting or responding to the substantive points and information in
the SB

The SB needs no refutation by me  The patent absurdity of your
beloved Great Book speaks for itself

	Your ignorance is clearly showing itself again Mark
	Why don't you read the post and show us all where the
	Silver Bulletin is wrong It is an expose' of the
	corruption and fraud in government Or do you feel
	that our wonderful state is just nifty and sweet

Fine  If you think it's an expose of corruption and fraud
please prevent a jury question  Don't just reassert your
opening statement

  
For those in the dark I wrote to Teel's sysadmin noting that a he
wastes bandwidth by posting identical messages long ones to several
newsgroups independently instead of crossposting and b he has
improperly used his posts to advertise goods for sale
	A I was requested to post to those groups
	and they were getting deleted By whom
	B The goods for sale was a method of showing the
	source and obtaining further info
	And the message in question was retrieved in its entirety
	from the net I simply reposted it from one year ago

	Would there be a complaint if I had posted an article from
	Newsweek then posted the address and subscription price
	How about the subscription info for the American Law Review
	Bit of a double standard Yeah think so

No indication that was what happened until now  Editing down is
always possible

  
Readers more careful than AJ will note that the complaint appended
below expressly disclaims any wish to suppress Teel's postings merely
because they are infantile irrational and tedious
	More name calling Mark Is that your best shot
	Oh I see The reason for your sending that letter
	had nothing to do with your opinion of my information
	Right Clearly your motivations were the best interest
	of all of those poor users who could not speak for themselves
	If we weren't talking about attempted censorshipsp it
	would be funny

	Further your perception for want of a better term is not
	the feedback that I have been getting via email and others
	 The keep it up's outnumber the Go away's at least  to 

It would be interesting to hear who the responding parties are

	I for one have no intention of being a slave You may
	be so if you like Just remember where you heard that
	on Tribute Day April  I am not a th Amendment
	taxpayerslaveSSN holderetc Are you

FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

Don't let the IRS see this Mr Teel

   
	And by the way the reference to UCC  is made
	in pari materia with my CommonLaw Rights 
	is the recourse and  is the remedy

And as has been noted more times than we care to count about as

   	Well the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the

   withholding et cetera have been out there for a while now
   	There has been no refutation to date Have the naysayers
   finally given up as defeated Sure would like to hear there reasons
   for disbelief at this point

   Probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation I've posted
   Teel it's bad enough you post this bs it's even worse that you don't
   even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces but then posting
   that no one's looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the
   contrary point to a severely deluded mind

What I found interesting about Conklin's letter is the
 cases he has won against the IRS  Now assuming that
these cases really exist and were one by him anyone checked
they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim  The IRS fought
one of his deductions   Defending your deductions seems puny when
you believe that there is no need to file in the first place

Yet when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this
philosophy to cigarette smokers so that people who smoked away
from the work couldn't be discriminated against by employers
the liberal Gov Wilder vetoed it  Which shows that liberals don't
give a damn about best person for the job it's just a power
play

Of course Clayton ignores the fact that employers pay health
insurance and insurance for smokers is more expensive than for
nonsmokers

 Are you saying that

  People voted for Hitler and he became Reich Chancellor in good
 part because he used bully boys to attack communists

 Hitler did not become become Reich Chancellor because people voted for
 him I'm not sure if you meant to imply that or not but I just thought
 I'd bring that up

Hitler became Chancellor because people voted for his political
party  That's not a huge difference in a parliamentary system

Your statement is a common misconception but it just isn't true In the
German Weimar system the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the
largest Reichstag party the Chancellor was appointed by the President and
generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective
majority in the Reichstag Beyond that the implication that Hitler rose to
the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false
as well Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January
 the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by
Hitler or by the Nazi party These are the results of the March  election
for President the closest Hitler ever came to direct election Hindenburg
 Hitler  Thaelmann  Duesterberg  In the runoff election
in April the results were Hindenburg  Hitler  Thaelmann 
So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of
German voters

Similarly the Nazi party never received more than  of the vote in
Reichstag elections That occurred in July  In the November  election
the Nazis lost two million votes and  seats down from  to  out of
the  in the Reichstag Comparitively the Socialists had  and the
Communists  The Communists had gained  seats and the German National
party which had supported the previous government had picked up a million
of the Nazis' lost votes to gain  seats up to  I think the other large
party was the Catholic Center party I don't know how many seats they had but
I think they were declining and there were numerous other small parties
Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed
Chancellor

What brought Hitler to power was not the demand of the German people for
Hitler or the Nazis to run things but the inability of the other parties to
put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government
for the country Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition and
their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the
interests of the majority of the population Instead what they had was a
number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific
objectives in order to combine against the Nazis who were out to end the
democratic process In fact part of the problem was that some of the other
parties with substantial representation like the Communists were also
out to end the democratic process but with different results in mind and
generally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under

Germany had already had a nonNazi Chancellor with a majority coalition
for five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party and
there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis
If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed
to get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had
begun to decline

Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor not even his
second choice First von Papen had been Chancellor since June  After
the November election when the Nazis lost seats Hindenburg first prevailed
on von Papen to remain as Chancellor But there were intrigues behind his back
and support for him was lacking So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher
who became Chancellor for two months Eventually he too was unable to hold
together a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis who refused to
participate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor Some of
the Nazi leadership particularly Gregor Strasser who was the  man in the
party at the time wanted to participate in a coalition government But others
knowing the party's support was waning figured that their best hope to gain
power lay in undermining the democratic process Nevertheless the country
was governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis even though
the Nazis were the largest Reichstag party The failure of these men to
achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition
parties to work together

Here's how William Shirer puts it in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich

   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their
   failure to unite against it At the crest of their popular strength
   in July  the National Socialists had attained but  percent of
   the vote But the  percent of the German people who expressed their
   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine
   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm
   them unless they united however temporarily to stamp it out

True the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor But
that doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him
before he was in power The German people were not crying out for Hitler to
take over no matter how bad economic conditions were The leftist parties
SocialistsCommunists probably had more support in total than the Nazis
Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see
the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over

 In fact no one has such a list  The Clinton package as presently proposed
 includes a variety of recommended spending areas and dollar amounts  It
 does not include a linebyline list of every project that would be funded
 Congress may include such line items in the bill when it passes
 Likewise it may prohibit spending for specific projects as amendments to
 the bill  Such amendments positive and negative are often pointed to
 by those who propose a line item veto or enhanced recision power for
 the President

 Some of the  billion package is in the form of block grants to states
 and localities

This is why I asked to be 'enlightened'  You are making claims about what
'is' or 'is not' part of this program  But if the block grants go to states
and cities the mayors list is VERY relivent


 I'd suggest contacting your local officials reading a newspaper with
 good coverage of Congress Washington Post NY Times or if you're
 serious about paying attention to these issues get copies of Congressional
 Quarterly at your library or have your representative put you on the
 mailing list for the Congressional Record  It's free  But be prepared
 to invest more time in the effort than it takes to watch the evening
 news or read your local paper

Okay scarasm does deserve sacrasm but I already contact my local officals my
congress rep senators Watch evening news news programs and CSPAN


 In addition to the cherry picking that went on with the Mayors' wish list
 Congressional Republicans selected wish list projects from a variety of
 Federal agencies based apparently upon how silly the names of the projects
 sounded  I'm not even sure if they bothered to correlate a potential
 expenditure of an agency in Clinton's bill with a potential project from
 the same agency but it is clear that the effort was to make Clinton's
 potential expenditures appear to be linked to projects with absurd
 names  Not to be taken seriously any more than equivalent tactics by
 Democrats would have been in the ReaganBush era


The fact is that Primetime TM of ABC has had numberous reposts on such waste
programs that already exist  Again if we are truely intrested in eliminating
the DEBT we must REMOVE the DEFICIT and do away with ALL PORK 

 I realize that it is tempting to believe that government is in the hands
 of clowns who are dishonest at best  But such simplistic analysis does
 little to advance the cause of public education

There have been several books written on gov waste network news programs
from time to time devote segments to this and there have been bills proposed
that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by
changing the way 'congress does business' and make it more efficent

True blame is easy but also is spending someone else's money

Clinton ran on a platform that he would 'not raise taxes on the middle class
to pay for these his programs'  He has proposed a program that is not
specific that counts on tax hikes to pay for

 of who else but President of the United States William Jefferson Clinton
It's a much better deal to have him end his term of office in disgrace after
watching all his liberal democrat friends on his staff run this nation down
the toilet

Tsk Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country
just so your party can get some trivial political advantage That's rather
a petty way to think Not that this pettiness doesn't extend all the way
to the US Senate I've noticed

While Bush was president I kept hoping and praying that he'd wise up I
couldn't stand the man but I wish he'd done a decent job if so we might
not be in the mess we are now and that would be a small price to pay for
suffering through another term of Republican control Similarily YOU should
be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job Even if you're certain
he won't

julieeddiejplnasagov Julie Kangas writes
I suggest you
listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying
and compare that with the very antiWest slogans coming from his
opponents in the Russian congress  I sure know who I want to back

Could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a
gun

If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the
problem there is now  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy
and reforms when they felt rightly IMO that the West didn't care

Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid once Bush got over his
Gorbymania  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress
and calling for new elections  Well the aid didn't come through
and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the
antireformers are gaining strength where before they were in
hiding


Have you considered a noninterventionist policy  If market reform does
happen Russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to
help their economy  They will even have incentive to do so for the same
reason  If they don't reform then our government will probably
consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help
them

If they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money  However
I think this is too important to take a noninterventionist approach
This is what really bugs me about Libertarianism  it sounds like
'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time  no need to do
anything'


How does this affect us  Well we are on the same planet and if
vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something
A massive breakup of a country that spans th the planet is
bound to have affects here  Of course there is also the
humanitarian argument that democracies should help other
democracies or struggling democracies

If a  billion gift was that important to our well being couldn't it
be raised voluntarilly  People already give over  billion a year to
charity

Despite the wishes of Libertarians this society is a far way and getting
farther from being Libertarian  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if
we had the proper framework but we do not have it  We have to face the
problem now not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society

Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade let alone charity
There are still limitations to hightech exports  NASA can't buy
Proton launch vehicles from them  Sure the market may be able to
help a great deal but it can't right now  There are too many obstacles
Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to
tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face

Seriously  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid
My two causes are aid to Russia and a strong space program
Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies
of drunken goldfish  That is why we have a republic and not a
true democracy  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale we
only have gridlock on a congressional scale

It seems instead of gridlock on any scale we have aid to Russia
expensive space programs national charity that doesn't help the poor
and probably studies of drunken goldfish  I think limited government
is more key than how democratic it is

Well I think limited government is primarily democratic due
to it being limited  But the main question is how do you transform
a staterun economy and monolithic government into something that
even remotely looks like ours  BTW sometimes it seems that our government
is trying to go the opposite direction  It is not going to be
painless and not going to be easy  We simply cannot wait to
help when they have the 'proper' government  They'll never
get there without the aid  It may be too late already


BTW who is to decide 'stupid'  This is just like those who
want to impose their 'morals' on others  just the sort of
thing I thought Libertarians were against

That was an opinion and libertarians are very big on free speech

And I'm just excercising mine


Actually my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue
and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party  It seems
that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and
let it sink or swim

If you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should
be VERY libertarian  Consider it a compromise  How much money would
your fellow Russiaaiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose
weren't using the same government machine to steal money from you
and your group for causes you don't support

As I also said above another problem I have is with transformation
A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight
I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and
society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible
selfsufficient populace


We could do that  years ago but not now

People have been saying that for hundreds of years

They didn't have nuclear weapons  years ago  Nor instantaneous
communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in
less than a day


Like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and
global decision making

All the more reason to depend on the free market which can more
efficiently process information than to depend on rulers for decisions
on complex issues

Yes depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses  Rulers
do emerge somewhere and they will never represent the opinions of
every person on the planet

There must be checks and balances  Checks on the government when
it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of
bounds  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market
is to me just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of
government

Please point out where I have said I even was a member of that group
much less asked to be treated as such much less insisted upon it

Sexual orientation is not defined by the antidiscrimination law
that was passed last year  Pedophilia isn't a sexual orientation

Wait a minute  You've been claiming for quite a while now that
pedophilia according to CA state law is a sexual orientation  Now
your position is that the law doesn't specifically exclude it

You know damn well what's going to happen  Some guy in a NAMBLA
Tshirt's going to apply at a daycare they're going to turn him down
he's going to take it to court and the court's going to rule that
sexual orientation is defined as homosexuality heterosexuality or
bisexuality

Unless and until that court decides that pedophilia is a sexual
orientation you have no business saying so

 Silence  Death pin or something  They turn me down because of
 that

I wholeheartedly support their right to take this action  I wouldn't
do it myself unless it was something like the NAMBLA Tshirt

Despite the fact that all homosexuals are lying bastards

 How about  a black man applies for a job at a bank  The bank decides
 based on statistics a black person would be more likely to steal
 money and denies the man the job  Would you support the bank's right
 to this freedom

I support their right to do so deletia but deletia

Ah

So for example you are opposed to the Civil Rights Act of 

Here's the law that was passed and signed by the governor

     The people of the State of California do enact as follows

        SECTION   The purpose of this act is to codify
   existing case law as determined in Gay Law Students v
   Pacific Telephone and Telegraph  Cal d  
   and Soroka v Dayton Hudson Corp  Cal App d 
    prohibiting discrimination based on sexual
   orientation
        SEC   Section  is added to the Labor Code to
   read
          a Sections  and  prohibit
  discrimination or disparate treatment in any of the terms
  and conditions of employment based on actual or
  perceived sexual orientation
              

       b  This section shall not apply to a religious
  association or corporation not organized for private
  profit whether incorporated as a religious or public
  benefit corporation

There's no for purposes of this act the term 'sexual orientation' will
be defined as section  No definitions anywhere  Did they run this
through the state Congress on an accelerated schedule or something

The SC allows restrictions after 'viability' a term never medically defined
                                               

Any physician who can't make a reasonable stab at determining whether a given
fetus is viable or not is not qualified to perform an abortion

Kebbin shows that he does not know the difference between determining
the viability of an individual fetus and providing the universally
accepted medical definitions of viability

I was not discussing universal definitions in this post Mark Please
refrain from dragging in irrelevancies

Do you agree with my statement above about physicians being unqualified if
they can't determine viability

Since we know
that there are SOME physicians out there who are qualified to perform
abortions then obviously SOME medical definition of viability is being
employed

On an case by case basis viability is relatively easy to determine

And that's good enough for the law Mark So why do you keep whining that
viability isn't defined What purpose does your whining serve

If the heading is true Mr Frank should be ashamed of himself

Nothing makes me gag more than people who don't respect the
rights of others to voice their opinions  My idol Lenny Bruce
once commented about that asshole Time Magazine when they
advocated censorship of his material  Time actually sided
with the cops' and their arresting of Bruce at his shows
whereby he routinely would say cocksucker then the cops
would rush the stage to arrest him  My how the times haven't
changed

I can't help but think of how Lenny would be received in today's
politically correct arena  Heck I even support the right of
neo nazis to speak their opinions and march down the streets

And before Mr Frank or anyone else makes any wisecracks about
antiSemitismI'm Jewish a longtime member of AIPAC and the JNF
and have contributed over  apiece to these fine groups  I'm
a regular contributor to every proIsrael group I can find but I
still support the right of people like Arf to speak up and vomit
his propaganda

I want to know just WHO these people are 

I'm basing all this on the assumption that Mr Frank did indeed
write to some sysadmin requesting Mr Teel to be admonished  If
this is not the case I hereby retract these nasties directed
toward him  If not I stand against Mr Frank and his trashing
of the First Amendment

And Ms Regard please don't give us the trite you can't legislate
morality nonsense again there is little else that is legislated
including the moral concept of rights

Really Pure Socialism had this belief and fell flat on its ass by
attempting to follow such reasoning Suppose you pass a law that
states that I must love my neighbour regardless of race religion
etc How exactly do you plan to enforce such a law Better yet how
do you plan to measure compliance And even if you overcome those
two obstacles how will you ever know if I have become more moral
or not

You either missed the point or are being somewhat disingenuous  I have
never heard anyone suggest that you can legislate what people think
Laws are based on either expediency ie traffic laws or morality ie
human rights as far as I can tell and the majority are based on the
latter

Once more around the racetrack See the original statement that it is
nonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality I simply stated
that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them
will make you or I more moral people They may make us act in a moral
manner but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to
risk punishment They say nothing about whether we have become more
moral or not Perhaps the distinction is too fine

 It leaves us with peace If Morocco is your father's land then you

I have the right to live there UNDER the established

details that you are seeking is that the GrahmRudman budget controls
were working  In fact they were working so well that unless the feds
did something they were going to have to start cutting pork So Bush
and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced
GrahmRudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush

Yea it turned out that GrammRudman was a sham to fool the voters
into accepting the borrowandspend policies of the last  years



As it turned out the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps
					
Anyone can expand the economy by chargeing  trillion on their credit
cards   Big deal  Deficit spending only expands the economy in the short
term  In the long term it shrinks the economy for numerous reasons I would
have MUCH preferred that the taxpayers had that  trillion instead


The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level
ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office

Chew on that awhile


If Reagan had kept his campaign PROMISE to balance the budget by 
there would have been no need for Bush or Clinton to raise taxes  And
all Reagan had to do was balance that puny Carter deficit

Chew on that awhile

     education firstI mean we took that for granted

 The 's generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible

 The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
 kids would not want for anything  going overboard and creating a nation of
 brats

 Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 

 Apollo  and Woodstock

 Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
 reverted to the cultural level of primitives defecation in public etc

 And which group assembled took care of itself and dispersed with no damage
 no deaths no large numbers of drug problems 


	Wasn't Woodstock also called the biggest parking lot in
history  They rejected society and went back to nature in their

 But Clinton's proposal now sounds like something out of Soylent

 the only way we can have a decent medical system in this country
 is to accept an annual federally supported blood sacrifice in the
 form of hundreds of thousands of publicly providedfunded
 abortions  It's ridiculous  It's offensive  And it's an
 absolute insult to our collective intelligence

We already kill people death penalty and that costs even more
money so you could as well complain about this extremely barbaric
way of justice

But the death penalty is right

      The death penalty is usually administered at the state level
How many federal crimes get the death penalty

And how expensive can an execution be I mean I think rope cyanide
for the gas or the rifles and ammunition to arm firing squads are
affordable

Now perhaps lethal injection might be expensive in that case let's
return to the more efficient methods employed in the past

      Executions are cheap  Appeals are the expensive part

Then eliminate the appeals  Sounds simple enough to me

No doubt you base this on your assumption that a jury of attack puppies
would never find an innocent person guilty

If someone beats up a homosexual he should get charged for assault and

double jeopardy  Or am I just being a fascist again

 To deter an epidemic of gay bashing that has not been deterred by
   assault laws

So we ought to make beating up a homosexual more illegal than beating up a
straight  Silly me thinking that the issue was that we are all people to be
treated equally  Thanks for straightening me out

Wrong if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight
bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody
fuck out of him they would get charged as well under all the federal laws
that exist about violation of civils rights The focus of their intent is
his sexual orientation and so the law applies to them as well The
national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to
sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights
until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it
The fact is that at last count gays were not beating straights for their
sexual orientation Thus the law is getting applied only to the straights
who indulge themselves The federal government or judiciary has the right
to enforce the th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even
if it takes  possible charges against people who would violate them Go
read your constitutional law We broke the back of the KKK's harrassment
campaign with the same strategy in the early 's So many went to jail
and for so long that it cut the heart out of the KKK
RSW

 No it is not double jeopardy  A single act may lead to multiple
   charges and multiple crimes

I think what you meant to say here was With the current mutation of the US
Constitution under the current police state someone may be charged multiple
times for one act if the victim in question is of the right shade  A single
act should never merit more than on charge  That's almost like if four cops
got acquitted from cruel and unusual punishment charges and the country went
and tried them again and again until they oh never mind

This mutation as you call it protects your little butt too if you
happen to be somewhere where you're the wrong shade for somebody else's
taste If it can be shown that the motive for the assault on you was
racially motivated then the full power of these extra laws that bring more
charges and punishments will come against those who harmed you The first
use of such laws was well over a hundred years ago and constitutional
scholars of all conviction recognize that this right reserved to the
federal government is well established and not just some shortlived
peculiarity too Go read some constitutional law for awhile Maybe you'll
get it

infinitesimal minority right

You know I have thought about the issue of if someone beats up a
homosexual or a black person etc should the crime be specified
as something special  Shit beating up anybody regardless of race
and sexual orientation should be a very serious crime  If you
pick out those crimes which are committed against the opposite sex
different race or a different sexual orientation is this a form
of favoring those groups over other groups  Hmm  I mean I think
that a crime committed against all people should be treated the
same  But I know that there are many people out there who are
very prejudice against people who are different than they are  And
perhaps hate crimes laws are the only way to punish the bastards
appropriately  But why should a person who commits a crime against
a wealthy protestant white by a wealthy protestant white be treated
on a lower level  Isn't this discrimination against the wealthy
white person

Hmm  Any input out there  As a black person I here about all
sorts of stories where fellow blacks are persecuted and beat up
because of their race  This really tears me up  But a crime
against a white by a white should also be treated as a heinous
crime

Please respond  I would like to hear what other views are out ther

Ciao'
Mimi

The federal government has used such laws to allow mutliple charges in
order to prevent more crimes than would nromally occur just from two people
being pissed off at each other The federal government has an interest in
the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of
civil rights It's the way they broke the back of the Klan by putting a
lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically
It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid
since over  years ago It has been used whenever a select group was
getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being
part of a minority It is the only way we made the defeat of the south
stick after the Civil War People who harrassed free blacks when normally
they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were
expeditiously tried and jailed for  to  years until nobody wanted to try
it anymore Now with the th amendment guarantee of equal protection under
the law the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent
as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to
somebody They can call out the national guard just for them as they did
the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 's and the
president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the
militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the
thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey
or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms And by god
they did Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets And
the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls
that had brought the order to nationalize the guard And that's why we need
such an ability in federal jurisdiction

For Immediate Release                             April  


                      REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
               SECRETARY OF EDUCATION RICHARD RILEY AND
                   SECRETARY OF LABOR ROBERT REICH  IN
                GOALS  SATELLITE TOWN HALL MEETING

                     Chamber of Commerce Building
                           Washington DC



 PM EDT


	     SECRETARY RILEY  Good evening and welcome to all of you
in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking
part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April

	     You know today is April th  In  Thomas
Jefferson was born  years ago  I think that's appropriate to
mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he
has been of course a person who has been one that we've all
followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education
here in this great country  The success of our democracy according
to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational
system

	     His philosophy of government his belief in the
importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest
here this evening  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us
President Clinton  He's come over from the White House to join us in
the Chamber of Commerce studios

	     Mr President it's good to have you  We thank you for
taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite
network and we welcome you here this evening

	     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich
And Bob it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening
also

	     I have some questions for our two guests and I'm sure
many of you do too  So please call us if there's something that
you'd like to ask  The number is  or   In
Washington DC the number is  or 

	     I believe the President has a few words that he might
want to share with us  And Mr President I'll ask you to do that
at this time  It's great to have you

	     THE PRESIDENT  Thank you very much Mr Secretary

	     I'm glad to be here with my friends Dick Riley and Bob
Reich  also members of my Cabinet  at the headquarters of the
Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making
along with its Center for Work Force Preparation to help to examine
tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people
from school to the work place

	     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts
recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this
economy or remain competitive and recognizing that we all have to
work together  business and government labor and educators  to
make things happen

	     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that
kind of working together  And if you'll forgive me a little home
state pride I want to say a special word of thanks to the WalMart
Corporation headquartered in Bentonville Arkansas for providing
several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight  I
appreciate that a lot as well as the sites that are provided for all
the rest of you

	     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward
constructive change for this country  Secretary Riley talked about
this being Thomas Jefferson's th birthday  If Thomas Jefferson
believed in anything he believed in these three things  first in
education second in real personal liberty freedom of religion
freedom of speech freedom of association freedom of the press and
third in the absolute imperative of changing as times change

	     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this
beautiful city which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful
cherry blossoms you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change
with changing times

	     For us here in America that means reducing our deficit
and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we
can compete in the world  We're here to talk about that tonight 
about what we can do to educate and train our people better  Unless
we do that none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in
government even to bring the budget into balance even to increase
our investment in other things which will grow jobs will last in the
long run

	     We also have to have people who can carry their load
And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven
or eight times in a lifetime that begins with the education system
and continues into the work force where education must go on for a
lifetime  It's not just important what you know but what you can
learn

	     And if I might I'd like to close just by emphasizing
we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership
between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the
private sector to build a good schooltowork transition  And we're
trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that
would create more than  new summer jobs including many
thousands that have a strong education component so our young people
can be learning and working at the same time

	     Dick I think I ought to stop there  That's a good
place we can begin I think the discussion

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Thank you so much Mr President

	     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all
citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals  And
tonight we'll focus on goal five and how communities such as yours
can prepare students for this world of work

	     This week the Education Department and the Labor
Department are hosting a conference here in Washington DC called
Summer Challenge a program of work and learning to America's youth
The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's
proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationallyenriched
jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged
areas of the country

	     Mr President let's talk a minute  you alluded to it
somewhat  about the  Summer Youth Challenge  Your program calls
for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs  And why in your
words is that so important

	     THE PRESIDENT  I think it's important for two reasons
First of all a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may
have had trouble adjusting to school and learning  And while we want
them to have a good experience with a real job we also want them to
continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of
research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may
forget as much as  percent of what they learned the previous year
over the summertime  And that is a very unproductive thing for
schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already
taught before

	     Secondly we want to help these young people progress
not only in terms of work but in terms of learning  We want to
abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is
learning because we think that the best and most productive workers
will have to be lifetime learners  And we think that this experience
could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to
succeed in school or at work or in college as they go on

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Well I think the fact that these are
disadvantaged kids  that gap that lag you mentioned as they go
into the next year is really even greater

	     Secretary Reich of course you have training programs
throughout the year  And I wonder is you have any comment about this
educational component of training

	     SECRETARY REICH  Well what we've learned Mr
Secretary is that for many young people whether it's for the summer
or for the year actually onthejob work experience combined with
education is one of the best ways of learning  Many young people
for example have a lot  they have a difficult time learning
geometry  But when they actually are there building something or
working on something and they can see the exact and direct
application of geometry they understand what it's used for  And a
lot of young people  just that sense of connection between
education and the world of work is terribly terribly important
It's important during the summer but it's important for a lot of
young people even beyond the summer

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Thank you

	     Mr President you've called for a youth apprenticeship
program schooltowork transition  And I wonder if you would tell
us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it
developing

	     THE PRESIDENT  Well first of all let's talk about why
it's important  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade
will not require a fouryear college degree but most of them will
require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people
get in a high school diploma

	     If you look at the last  years the average salaries
of young people that had at least two years of good posthigh school
education was a good salary that went up over the decade  The young
people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not
go up and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade because
they weren't productive they weren't more valuable to their
employers

	     So we think America has a big economic interest in
trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school
but don't go on to college make a transition to work which includes
two years of further training either in a community college a
vocational setting or perhaps on the job  And what I have done in
this budget as you know is to give you and Secretary Reich some
funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states
and with the private sector to build these programs statebystate in
a way that would be customized essentially by the business community
based on the needs of the economy in any given area  It could
revolutionize longterm the quality of the American work force and
the earnings of American workers

	     SECRETARY REICH  I should add Mr President  I think
you know this from your experience in Arkansas  and many of the
people watching this program  that the business community and
educators labor groups are already in many of our communities many
of our states building a schooltowork transition program  In
fact there's an awful lot of ferment a lot of excitement  The
people watching this program probably are the ones who are most
directly involved in that  And more power to them  Secretary Riley
and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes
already out there

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Bob we're going to be talking tonight
about youth apprenticeship and tech prep the coop learning
career academies  And what features all those programs that deal
with this subject  what are some of the features that every one of
these schooltowork programs might have that   are important

	     SECRETARY REICH  Well one thing that we've seen  and
you and I have been working at this for a long time and you much
longer than I  we've seen that active involvement of the business
community is absolutely essential  And I'm so delighted that we're
doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce  The
Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these
kinds of programs  training education retraining  and we've
aimed to work very closely with the Chamber

	     The business community is going to be actively engaged
in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and
helping the educators community colleges technical institutions
develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future

	     Communities have got to come together  I mean this is
one of the most important things  You've got to have all of these
players in a community come together and work together and cooperate
together  You know too often we have the educators over here and
the business leaders over here labor groups over here and everybody
is talking but they're not really working together in a common
strategy

	     And the third and final ingredient I would say Dick
would be a commitment to excellence  a commitment both to academic
excellence and also to skills development excellence  This is not a
tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to
make it  This is a program that every young person ought to be
eligible for  If they want to go on beyond that to fouryear
college that's fine  That ought to be permissible  But we're
talking about the foundation of learning about jobs the foundation
skills for onthejob learning

	     And again those are the critical components  It's
already being done

	     THE PRESIDENT  I think  if I might just interject one
point based on my personal experience at home  the business
community has a critical role to play not simply in saying here are
the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught
but also in monitoring that excellence  If you have the right sort
of partnership there the people who are paying the taxes and who are
going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the
secondrate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and
influence them  So I think that's very important

	     And when we try to if you will fill in the blanks at
the federal level trying to set some standards and provide some
funds one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make
sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the
quality of these programs because that's really what's going to
determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile

	     SECRETARY RILEY  That's great  We've been talking of
course about schooltowork and also the jobs and economic recovery
program for this summer and fall  But let's talk just a moment about
longterm school reform  It's something especially close to me  Mr
President I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the
communities out here on Goals  legislation that I think will be
coming forth before too long

	     THE PRESIDENT  Well as you know back when you and I
were both governors we spent a lot of time working on our public
schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that
a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize

	     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals
that the governors drafted along with representatives of President
Bush's administration back in   And what we're going to try to
do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in
Congress that will actually define the things that the national
government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the
children of this country and the adult learners too meet those
goals  making sure that when  by  people show up for school
ready to learn that we get a  percent ontime high school
graduation rate that children at the th th and th grades are
confident in the subjects they're supposed to know that they are
second to none in math and science that are schools are safe
disciplined and drugfree  And of course the fifth goal I took
them out of line to say this the last  is that we have a system of
lifelong learning in this country

	     And each one of those goals there's a national role a
state role a school role school district role and a private sector
role  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to
introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is
and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job
is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality
that we need to meet

	     It's very exciting  So far as I know nothing quite
like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before
Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their
money but actually setting up a framework for excellence and
partnerships so that we can do our job  I'm really excited about it

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Well I am too  And I think really
it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms
of its relationship with states serving as a partner really to
support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform
efforts all driven by high standards  That's the point

	     Bob let me ask you one question and then we'll get to
the telephone calls  It's about the same subject  We have of
course skills standards that are going to be part of Goals  and
I wonder if you would comment on that

	     SECRETARY REICH  Well you know we have  percent of
our young people who don't graduate from college  Very often they
don't have very many alternatives  They do have a wonderful system
of community colleges and technical institutions but if we had
national skill standards to which they could aspire and which
employers would understand as a national credential many of these
young people would actually find that they were much more eligible
for jobs

	     Everybody doesn't have to go to college  Other
countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to
college but you have a whole level of people who have certain
technical preprofessional skills  We can do it in this country  If
you don't go to fouryear college you're not a loser  And we want to
develop those national skill standards  We're going to be working
with the states with the Education Department with a lot of private
industry in developing those standards  And I think they will be the
kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other
institutions to rally around as well as our business community

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Well that's great  Why don't we go
ahead and go to the telephone  We have a call I see  Mayor Bruce
Todd of Austin Texas

	     Q	  Yes Mr President and Mr Secretary Reich and
Riley we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today  We
have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who
have heard what you have said and are very appreciative  Let me
simply say amen to some of the comments made already  We agree with
much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken and are
very supportive

	     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our
summer employment program over the last four years  We expect to
have over  employed this year in the summertime perhaps as much
as  with the federal assistance

	     Much of the question that we had designed you have
answered in your opening comments so we must be thinking alike  But
the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day
would be appropriate  We know summertime is important  Yearround
is even more important  And what kind of initiatives at the federal
level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year
round basis  And perhaps more importantly how can families and the
local community be more involved using the federal initiative That's
something that we believe is very important to success in this
effort

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Mr President

	     THE PRESIDENT  I think I'll give everybody a chance to
answer the question Bruce but let me first thank you for calling
and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin
I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed

	     First with regard to the summer program we hope we can
structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer
program and that will move a lot of these young people back into
schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in
the private sector too  We hope that  Secretary Reich is going to
try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs
to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer  And we're
working on that

	     Secondly in the program that I have presented to the
Congress over the next five years what we are attempting to do is to
build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job
training programs for schooltowork programs all of which give
heavy heavy weight to local community input  just the question you
asked  but do provide some federal investment dollars which we
hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being
trained on a yearround basis

	     And I will say again to echo what Secretary Reich said
a moment ago to try to break down the barrier between what is seen
as work and what is seen as learning  An awful lot of young people
actually have quite high IQs but actually learn so much better when
they're doing than when they're reading or just listening  So we
hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent and
we hope that if the whole budget passes  and we do have  budget
cuts and more than  actually in the budget  and some revenue
raisers and some new money for education and training that we'll be
able to do just what you seem to want based on your question

	     Bob do you want to say anything

	     SECRETARY REICH  Well you took most of the words out
of my mouth Mr President as usual  But let me just add one thing
and that is that one of the most important aspects of posthigh
school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college in
addition to the schooltowork program simply is the availability of
jobs  And we've got to get this economy moving again obviously
It's terribly important to get this recovery program to get the
economy back on track  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything
else  If we don't get the economy back on track  we have  I
think this is the th  correct me if I'm wrong Mr President  I
think is the th month we have had seven percent unemployment or
greater  This is a jobless recovery  A lot of those kids are going
to be getting out of school in June  And even if we did everything
right they would have a very very hard time getting jobs

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Thank you both  Of course Goals 
will be a permanent longterm thing that will certainly reach into
next year  It will involve if passed  and we certainly hope it
will be  action plans with every state where we can be working
together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways  And
then the state with all the various school districts a very
important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement  And I
think everybody will see a great energy out there once we get that
moving

	     The next call is Dr Harry Heinemann New York

	     Doctor

	     Q	  Good evening Mr Secretary  It is a pleasure to
be on with you this evening  As you may know bridging the school
and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since
its inception in the s and that includes the college the two
alternative high schools that operate on our campus and the linkages
we have forged with the local schools  We have found this to be an
extremely effective learning strategy

	     And over the years we've come to believe that there are
several principles that are very important in bridging the school and
work  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with
practice in the workplace with providing all students early exposure
to careers as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect
upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills and
lastly the critical role of the liberal arts particularly in the
development of high performance competencies

	     My question then is  How can the general education
faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with
transition to work experience  And what mechanisms and strategies
can you suggest to achieve this integration

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Well thank you very much  I think 
and we'll get a response from you all on that and very interesting
work going on there  We're going to have three people our next
guests on the program this evening that will be some specialists
in that area that you're speaking and I'll certainly pass that on to
them and we can discuss it later

	     You all care to comment  any comments you might have

	     THE PRESIDENT  I'd just like to say if I might one
thing  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as
clear about it as I'd like although I think at least one of the
people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more
explicitly than I  I think this whole concept of applied academics
is very important  And I think that we have to basically abolish
what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is
vocational learning and what is academic learning

	     I think we should keep the liberal arts going  I think
we should have a strong component for people who are in the
vocational program

	     SECRETARY REICH  It seems to me that we also need to
rethink our entire tracking system because a lot of these school and
work combinations are important for mainstream students  They're
important for all students  It's not just a special group of
students that needs them

	     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United
States  Dick I'm sure you've seen them as well  are mainstream
experiments  They're mainstreaming all the students  At th and
th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience
and then a transition program  And again the kids can either go on
to college if they want they can go on to technical community they
can go on to an entirely  a large variety of possibilities and
career directions

	     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often
goes on with young people who simply are doing jobrelated or work
related work within the classroom within our schools

	     SECRETARY RILEY  Thank you very much  I think that's
going to be the last call that we have time for  Mr President I
think you've got to move on to another matter and I want to thank
you and Secretary Reich for being here  We appreciate your time and
your ideas and it's been a tremendous help to us

                                 END PM EDT

The most recent reason given by the Clinton Administration for
calling for federally funded abortions is that many private
health insurance programs offer coverage for abortion

RE Abortion and my health insurance coverage


TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly

                              Sincerely



My policy number is



To your state and national representatives





RE Abortion and health coverage

Dear


It has recently come to my attention as a result of the current
abortion debate that my health insurance coverage provided by my
employer may include coverage paying for abortions

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and am
disturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in this
manner  However I depend on my employers' provided health
coverage and fear that if I speak up about it that I may lose
not only my coverage but even my job

I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that health
insurance providers make abortion coverage noncompulsory in
their health insurance program so that it can be declined with
an appropriate reduction in premium

In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in the
health benefit packages between those who would choose to have
abortion coverage and those who would not I further ask that you
include a provision in which the reduction in premium resulting
from the declining of abortion coverage be paidout to the
employee rather than pocketed by the employer

This second provision should serve to dissuade employers from
pressuring employees into taking one or the other stand with
regard to abortion services  Thank you very much  Your fellow
citizen

                                   Sincerely

Procedural note Ted directed followups to misclegal only  While I
respect his right to do so my own opinions are that  FollowupTo
fields are mere suggestions not mandatory commands and  this issue
is of sufficient a general political relevance and b civil liberties
interest to warrant keeping it active in tpm and ascl as well at
least for this round

In article Aprmidwayuchicagoedu
thfmidwayuchicagoedu said

 Uh no  That's not what happened in Boomer  What happened in
 Boomer was that the judge didn't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail
 the cement plant by demanding a multimillion dollar plant to be shut
 down over  in damages and required the plant to pay the
 plaintiffs the  to make them whole  The plant would never
 have been shut down the plaintiff's lawyers would have just
 negotiated a windfall settlement because the plaintiffs would prefer
 an amount greater than K to having the plant shut down while the
 plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have
 the plant continue in operation  Everyone's property rights were
 protected the plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement
 costs were avoided

Okay now here's my interpretation of Boomer based on the facts as
presented in the New York Court of Appeals holding Boomer v

Note The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York
   State  While the United States and  of the fifty states call their
   highest court Supreme Court Supreme Judicial Court or Supreme
   Court of Appeals Maryland and New York call theirs simply the
   Court of Appeals  To make matters worse New York also calls its
   secondhighest court the Supreme Court Appellate Division

Atlantic Cement Co  NYd   NEd  

Oscar H Boomer et al owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's
plant near Albany NY  The fact pattern gives no information as to
which came first the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he
defendant's start of production at their cement plant  In the course
of its regular operations the cement plant did injury to the
plaintiffs' property via dirt smoke and vibrations emanating from the
plant  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief  that is they asked
the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property

Commentary this seems entirely reasonable to me  Boomer at al owned
their property and presumably a right to quiet enjoyment of it
Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right

Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction the court
ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property provided
that Atlantic Cement paid them  in compensatory damages  In
other words the court granted Atlantic Cement Co a private party the
power and authority to take the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment
of their property by eminent domain  A taking by eminent domain is
always problematical even when it's done by the state allowing a
private firm to do it is in my opinion totally wrong

Yes I know the Boomer court didn't call it eminent domain  But if
it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks
like eminent domain

Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case you say that
What happened in Boomer was that the judge didn't allow the
plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multimillion
dollar plant to be shut down over  in damages  Blackmail

    Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary Abridged th Edition
    Blackmail Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to
    do bodily harm to injure property to accuse of crime or to expose
    disgraceful defects  This crime is commonly included under
    extortion statutes

How do you define as blackmail one party's act of demanding the right
to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns
and which another party has expressed an interest in buying  Or of
demanding the right not to sell that property at any price  As I see
it Boomer et al having found themselves in the fortunate position of
owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to
stay in business had every right in the world to set whatever price
they wanted  There isn't or at least shouldn't be any law that says
that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings

You go on to say The plant would never have been shut down  the
plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement
because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than K to
having the plant shut down while the plant would prefer any amount less
than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation

If so so what  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from
other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those
other parties  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice
between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business well
shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going into
business  I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were not
the parties responsible for bringing about this situation  that was
Atlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type
of plant they did where and when they did

And then you say Everyone's property rights were protected the
plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were avoided
As above I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were made whole
They were in fact by court action deprived of their rights as owners
of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price
acceptable to them  And for that deprivation they were not made
whole  And again I ask Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided
If so I've been miseducated  I always thought that the courts were
supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done

 Is Boomer really being taught as infamous  That's really sad if
 it is because I fail to see how it's less than completely sensible
 You should read the law and economics stuff firsthand instead of
 filtered through teachers who clearly don't like it for whatever
 inexplicable reasons

 Boomer is not being taught as infamous at least not at my
school

Aside Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for
their firstyear mandatory classes such as Torts where I first
encountered Boomer instructors who regardless of their personal
opinions can and do teach the law neutrally  When the students get
into their second and third years in which the students a can pick
and choose which courses to take except for the mandatory Professional
Responsibility of course and b are presumed to be a bit more worldly
and selfconfident less likely to be consciously or subconsciously
intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly
biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them the instructors
tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions  This is
especially true of parttime instructors who in real life are
practicing attorneys or sitting judges this can be very
educational sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat
cloistered scholar  End of aside

I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it  For the reasons
I've stated above I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can
only call economic correctness over justice

 It is completely sensible only if you believe that the alleged
right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid
losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and
the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to
not have their jobs disappear should trump the rights of people who
own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts
And if you believe that it is correct for the courts or any other
branch of government to grant to private parties the right to take
other people's property by eminent domain

 You'd like Posner Bill  He's a libertarian

Really  I didn't know that what if anything has he had to say
about cases like Boomer

 Of course he has too much of a paper trail to ever be nominated by a
 president Democrat won't like his antitrust stance or Republican
 won't like his support of gay marriage and if bright law students
 shiver at what they don't understand it's easy to imagine how the
 press will play it up as babyselling  I've seen Mike Godwin claim
 that Posner asserts that law and economics is applicable to everything
 and is the endall and beall when Posner says precisely the
 opposite  So it goes

I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to
as law and economics is weak  If it advocates the use of economical
analysis as one of many tiebreaker factors which courts may use to
help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute as measured by
the scale of justice is evenly balanced fine  But as illustrated by
Boomer it is not fine when the courts start viewing the economics
of a case as being more important than the justice of a case

 On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling
 his so called stimulus package
 It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free
 immunizations for poor kids
 So now Clinton is claiming that the republicans are holding the health of
 poor kids hostage for blatantly political gains

 Aside from the merits or lack thereof of another free immunization program
 just what is such a program doing in a bill that is supposedly about
 creating jobs

Jobs  What the hell have jobs to do with it  It's another touchyfeely
program from the new vapid administration  The fact is the major claim
made for universal immunization  that all children will be immunized 
has absolutely no validity  Several states already have UI programs have
had these programs for years The result on average their success rates
are no better than the national average  It seems that the gummint hasn't
yet figured out a way to MAKE parents bring their kids in  Yet another case
of shameless demagoguery from the new Democrats the agents of change

 If Clinton is so hot to get this immunization program why doesn't he and
 the democrats just introduce it as a stand alone bill Isn't it possible
 that Clinton is the one doing the blatant political read pork manipulations
 here He is telling the republicans pass my mutibillion dollar package
 or I will go to the people and tell them that you are opposed to
 immunizing poor kids

What  Clinton using this issue for partisan gain  Do tell

 I have never thought highly of Clinton but stunts like this lower my
 opinion of him even further

 I thought one of Clinton's campaign themes was that he was going to be
 a new kind of politician This kind of manuevering would have made LBJ
 proud

All together now c'mon you know the words Meet the new boss Same as
the old boss  And the chorus We won't get fooled again

	In the hopes of adding a little life to what seems to be the
same old debates I would like to add a few bits of info and ask for
comments

 A couple days ago the headlines were splashed with stories of proof
   that the North Vietnamese had held US hostages after the war ended
	Way back in today's newspaper Page A of San Francisco Chronicle
   there is an article about the document that held the proof
	used without permission

	The document which was discovered in the archives of the Soviet
    Communist Party in Moscow is a Russian translation of what is described
    as a September  report prepared for the Vietnam Politburo by General
    Tran Van Quang who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the
    North Vietnamese army
         later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 
           Americans in North Vietnamese prisons
	Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a
    fabrication is to review Quang's career In  he said Quang was
    not deputy chief of staff he was the army commander in Military Region 
    in central Vietnam

 I heard on the radio that the Church of Scientology has filed for
   bankrupcy becuase the employees of Cocolat  owned by CoS filed a
   class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues
   to become members of the Church Anyone heard more about this

 Micheal Jackson went into business with Micheal Milken No lie

 True man did not invent the need for food shelter warmth and the ilk
 but man did invent the property laws and the laws of trespass
 But how do you think property is generated  Does it grow automatically
 on trees when we wish so or someone has to produce it 

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess some say it was the result of
the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris  In either case
the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years


     It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not
 provide us automatically with our needs

Oh  When did She stop  Mother Nature has been automatically providing
us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze  It
is not produced it produces itself year after year  Last night for
example I saw four deer crossing the road pretty sight too in an
earlier time one of them would have been dinner

 There are  ways to go with produced things the first is to
 trade it with the the persons who produced it
 The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced
 it The first way is the civilized method the second is how savages
 arrange their affairs

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes trading food and
clothing for weapons or services  The Native Hawaiians like their
Polynesian ancestors also could not conceive of that idea and shared
many things with the other Islanders  In fact hi'ipoi the Hawaiian
word for cherish means sharing food  The Great Mahele in which
the Islands were divided up moreorless evenly between the rich and
the poor was a white man's idea  In Africa villagers will often
share tools crops and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so
called theft of the scientists possessions  two concepts of which
until the visitors came along the natives had no understanding

These are the people we call savages

On the other hand carjackings and muggings are up from last year

Dov before you make further comment on this thread I think it would
behoove you to study all of the facts

 Think about it  shouldn't all drugs then be legalized it would lower
 the cost and definitely make them safer to use

  Yes

 I don't think we want to start using these criterion to determine
 legality

  Why not

Where do they get these people  I really don't want to waste time in
here to do battle about the legalization of drugs  If you really want to we
can get into it and prove just how idiotic that idea is

You asked a question and now you don't want people to answer  I believe
a legitimate question was asked  Why shouldn't cost and safety be used
at least in part to determine legality

I'd like to see you prove that drug legalization is an idiotic idea
Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that
drug legalization is a good idea  Even such a noted conservative as
William F Buckley supports it

My point was that it is pretty stupid to justify legalizing something just
because it will be safer and cheaper

A few more ideas to hold to these criterion  prostitution the killing of all
funny farm patients AIDS victims elderly unemployed prisioners etc 
this would surely make my taxes decrease

Your examples except for prostitution fail miserably to meet both criteria
safer AND cheaper  Obviously killing people is not safe  As for
prostitution why shouldn't it be legal

crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer writes

 Can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as
 not humans  They were outside our society and similar phrases that
 basically meant that they didn't have to recognized as having the same
 rights as a free person but they were never considered not human to
 my knowledge

 	Isn't the fact that slaves were purchased as opposed to
 	hired enough evidence that they were not thought as humans
 	Didn't the Bill of Rights provide basic freedoms to humans
 	that were not available to slaves

Not necessarily  Distinctions were made between citizens and
persons throughout the US and various state constitutions
For example free blacks had some rights of citizens but not all
the rights of citizens  I'm curious if there was an additional
level of distinction made by the slave states to rationalize their
treatment of slaves or if they just ignored the theoretical
problems of slave ownership

The Bill of Rights as far as I can see does not once refer to citizens
but it makes several references to people For example Article IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers
and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be
violated Article V no person shall be held to answer for a capital
or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment by
a Grand Jury   nor shall any person  be deprived of life liberty
or property without due process of law Article VIII excessive bail
shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual
punishments inflicted

Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens
aren't they meant to apply equally to all persons living in the US
Whether slaves were considered not human I don't know but it seems
that a case could be made that they weren't treated as people as defined
in the Bill of Rights And since the nation is nominally based on the
Declaration of Independence which states that all Men are created equal
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights
that among these are Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness
it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition
of humanity

I'm short of patience tonite but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment

Although I'm an atheist the events in Waco have really sickened me  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty my general opinion of all religious people
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people

The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act but that was
an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started  War is bad
precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation  That principle
applies to all cases of warfare whether it's between nuclear superpowers
feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt  Why
was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would
also have worked  Why is the petty letter of the law more important than
peoples' lives and religious beliefs  Perhaps the supposed professionals in
our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid

It was interesting to watch the  club today  Pat Robertson said that the
Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god He
also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it
However I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
world had a similarly humble 'cultstatus' beginning even and perhaps
especially christianity  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled  Maybe David
Koresh really was Jesus Christ sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
new major religion to me

Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association

 Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to
Close Naval Marine Reserve Centers
 To National Desk Defense Writer
 Contact Herbert M Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of
          the United States 

   WASHINGTON April  US Newswire  The Reserve Officers
Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base
Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give
sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close
 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers
   In letters to the closure commission and to all  members of
Congress with affected locations in their constituencies including
Sen Sam Nunn DGa chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee ROA charged that the developers of the NavyMarine list
ignored demographics of the civilian population particularly prior
service personnel
   ROA's executive director Maj Gen Evan L Hultman AUS Ret
suggested concern that the only plausible alternative is that they
are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve
components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of
participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future
   He asked the commission to remove from consideration all
locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to
warrant approval of the requested action
   Only a few of the  Naval and Marine Corps Reserve
installations on this list are large enough to have a significant
impact on the community if closed wrote Hultman  The major
issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large
percentage of the existing locations
   Hultman reminded the commission The fact that the vast
majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come
close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this
process certainly supports the thesis that these actions are
simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and
Marine Corps Reserve
   ROA also noted that at the end of the s when the number of
Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today there were 
Naval Reserve facilities  If the Navy recommendations are
approved there will be less than  Naval Reserve facilities
   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging
from South Weymouth Mass to Alameda Calif  Naval
Reserve Centers in Macon Ga and Parkersburg WVa to
Missoula and Great Falls Mont  NavalMarine Corps Reserve
Centers include four in San Francisco Fort Wayne Ind
Billings Mont and Abilene Texas
   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El
Toro Calif plus six others

Jefferson was born  years ago  I think that's appropriate to
mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he
has been of course a person who has been one that we've all
followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education
here in this great country  The success of our democracy according
to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational

  I remain prochoice but when prochoicers compare abortion in a
  clinic to a religious ritual in a church you have to start wondering
  a bit if the prolife criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
  doesn't have a grain of truth to it

  Ah Clayton so I see that you have found someone new to bash  Tell
  me how many prochoicers have compared abortion in a clinic to a
  religious ritual in a church  I'll bet that you've seen overwhelming
  support for this opinion in some newsgroup or another

 In article optilinkCOM crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer writes
 No but I've seen the comparison drawn by prochoicers in capolitics
 It is worrisome to me  But not to you

  I've been reading capolitics for a while now and I don't recall
    seeing such a comparison

You don't read my postings very carefully I'm not surprised  It
was pretty shocking and is part of why my sympathy though not
agreement with the prolifers is increasing

  A handful of lunatic opinions expressed in capolitics does not
    make me think that the opinion is widely held

When did I say that it was

 Clayton I wish I knew what made you tick  Your math sucks and you
 take single instances of fringe opinions and proclaim the existence of
 a pernicious trend  There's about a quarter billion people living in
 this country  some small number of them are almost guaranteed to
 hold opinions that you and I find positively repellent  As long as
 the small number is truly a small number and as long as they're not
 my neighbor highly likely I'm not worried about it

When they hold high public office you should worry

 By the way when you cite experts remember that Carl Sagan and Paul
 Ehrlich sp are experts too  If I've never heard of your experts
 I'll consider the source you a man who is clearly unable to master
 elementary statistics and uses of statistical inference and ignore
 them

 David Chase

You mean I don't come to the conclusions that your emotional
state requires

   Professors get summers off industry employees don't
 
  What professor gets the summer off   The primary purpose of a professor
  at a university is to publish  Teaching is secondary  The summer
  is when professors are able to do the research required for their
  papers
 
 I'm told by my advisor that only at some universities is publishing
 the primary emphasis many professors in the Cal State University
 system don't publish at all  Those that prefer teaching are under
 no pressure to publish
 

 When discussing and issue it helps that all participants use the same
 definitions although this rarely occurs on Usenet

 When I use the term university I think of an organization that has
 a Bachelors Masters and PhD program  I believe that Cal State schools
 do not  I call them colleges  UC schools are universities  At a univeristy
 the number one goal is to publish

Cal State University system offers bachlors and masters degrees  The
PhD is not offered because of opposition from UC

 At the Cal State schools do the professors you speak of have PhDs  At

Nearly all the professors have PhDs  I haven't had a professor who didn't
though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an MA  A friend
had an instructor who didn't have a degree at all but because he had
been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers he was teaching anyway
He had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class and
finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him
to show up to teach

 a university you have professors with PhDs and then Teaching Assistants TAs
 TAs were the slave labor graduate students who got their tuition paid and
 a few hundred a month for living expenses in exchange for doing all the grunt
 work  The professors taught the lectures with  to  students per class
 then the TAs taught the labs with  to  per class

 Tim Fogarty FOGARTYSIRCJPLNASAGOV

At Sonoma State University typical class size is  to  per class
Teaching is definitely more the goal and sometimes it actually happens
The best professors at Sonoma State U are equivalent to the best
professors I had at UCLA and USC

                    Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                             April  


                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                      AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE


                            Hyatt Regency
                        Crystal City Virginia


 AM EDT


	     THE PRESIDENT  Thank you very much  The speech that
Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today
about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to
get a work experience and to continue to learn to merge the nature
of learning and work why it's important to honor the efforts of
people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of
those who are here

	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education
and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this and my
good friend Governor Wilder for being here and for speaking and
all of the business and local community leaders from the city and
county and state level from around America who are here

	     This has been a pretty fun day  Laughter  I loved
hearing the young people sing  It was music to my ears because it is
their future that we are really struggling about  Applause  A
year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because
I was concerned about their future  Because I believe that our
country which had always been a beacon of hope for the young had
too little opportunity was too divided among ourselves across lines
of income and race and region and other ways without a vision to
take us into the future

	     I entered with the hope that together we could create
more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of
our people  But in the process we might recreate the best of
America's community knowing that together we could always to more
than we could individually and that we might secure our future

	     All of you here today are committed to that  The 
jobs that Jerry Levin has committed TimeWarner to is symbolic of the
commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here
and those who are around the country  The work that Nancye Combs
does and the successes of all the young people like those on this
stage and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers  all
those things show that together we know what we need to do and we're
on the right track

	     Last July when I was traveling across America's
heartland in my luxurious bus I visited Seneca High School in
Louisville Kentucky  And there I met young people and business
people who were participating in the Louisville Education and
Employment Partnership  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today
I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed
both in school and at work  I saw as I have seen many times in my
own state the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about
 that for millions of American young people it is really an
impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good
workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what
is learning

	     In the world in which we are living the average young
person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a
lifetime  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning
world much better  And we must determine that all of our young
people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased
here today

	     Whether you're in business or in government or in
education you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to
building a future that really honestly includes opportunity for all
of our people  There are still a lot of people who say well things
are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine the best
thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing  They all have
jobs  Laughter  All the people who say that  Applause

	     They all have health insurance  They all have a pretty
good education  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that
they'll be okay no matter what happens  I say that not to be either
political or unduly critical but to point out that one of the great
challenges of this age for every advanced nation  everyone  is to
fully develop the capacities of all of its people and then find work
for them to do

	     All the European countries have higher unemployment
rates than we do but also stronger support systems for the
unemployed  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up
They're going to adopt a stimulus that even if you count it in its
most rigorous terms is three or four times bigger than the one that
I have proposed to create jobs

	     In West Germany alone the unemployment rate is now
about as high as ours  This is a big problem for advanced nations
It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee with a lot of
pressure from lowwage producers in other countries that are growing
their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their
people

	     But it is especially important for America for two
reasons  One is we have a whole lot of folks who unless we move
aggressively will not have the education and skills we need to be
competitive and productive in a nation like this  The second is
even if we educate them all if there aren't jobs they will be robbed
of the fruits of their educational labors  People need to be able to
work in this country  Applause

	     We have always had some unemployment and indeed some
of it is normal  You've always got some people leaving jobs and
moving around the country and doing first one thing and another  We
have now at this moment in our history the necessity for all big
organizations including the government to reexamine the way they
are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working
at some kinds of jobs  But in the whole we must still be able to
create jobs in a country like America to provide people with the
chance to work

	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare
reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of
months  it's going to be hard for me to make those work if at the
end of all this work to get off welfare there isn't a job
Applause

	     So we have two tasks  One is to develop the capacity of
the American people to perform without regard to race or income or
the circumstances of their birth  The other is to make sure that
there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their
talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck  It is a great challenge
I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple  But I know if
you want to ask the American people all of them to be more
responsible if you want to recreate a sense of community in this
country that bridges the lines of race and income and region you
have got to have opportunity in that mix

	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for
every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules
and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow  There has to be
something at the end of that rainbow  And that is what we are
basically here to talk about today  What can we all do as partners
recognizing none of us can do it alone to develop the capacities of
our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their
background  And then what can we do to make sure that there's
something there for them to do

	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an
integral part of that plan because it will promote the values of
work and opportunity and fairness community  It will put the people
first and it does have a partnership between the public and private
sector

	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in
February on this program that I would seek to create about 
extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the
American business community to meet that target so that we can create
more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been
created before

	     Many many people have responded to that challenge  And
Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in
this room and around the country  people who are going to do more
than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people
a work experience  And it is terribly important

	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is
part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the
American people  from retraining defense workers who lose their
jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills to improving
the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to
college but do need at least two years of posthigh school training
either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting
so that they can be competitive workers making it possible for more
people to go on to college who do want to go

	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive
plan  It's also important as I said that we create more jobs  The
emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would
create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half and
that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent  It
would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work
force in jobs that otherwise will not be created

	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to
invest in things that need to be done at the grassroots level 
projects long delayed water projects sewer projects park projects
new industries and particularly in small and mediumsize communities
 a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve
the environment

	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that
because we have tried for the first time through the work of the
Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching
out to people like you to make this more than just a oneshot summer
jobs program to integrate it with private sector efforts to
hopefully replicate it in each coming summer to move these young
people into further educational opportunities and to further job
opportunities and to have a strong meaningful education component
to these summer jobs  something that the United States government
has never fully emphasized before

	     A lot of these young people as you well know because
they come from difficult backgrounds because they go to school in
difficult and challenging circumstances need extra help in building
their basic skills in math and language reasoning and in other
areas  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who
have difficulty in school often forget as much as  percent of what
they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next
year

	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the
opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning
skills and to put them together and then hopefully over the next
couple of years if our entire program passes to give every school
in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning
environment

	     There will be more applied academics more opportunities
for people to learn and work during the school year so that this
will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks but will
be a part of building a whole new educational experience a whole new
work experience and moving on a pathway to a better future

	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make
work jobs  They're designed to make a future for the people holding
the job  And that's what they will do  In the process they'll help
to build local communities to strengthen local economies to solve
local problems  Real jobs  renovating housing repairing public
buildings doing clerical work providing nursing assistance in
hospitals supervising and training children at child care centers
and learning all the way  Challenging young people to learn while
they earn but letting them earn

	     You know it's very difficult to make a case to people
who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should
do this that or the other thing if there's no evidence of the
opportunity that's at the end of the effort  I have not been sparing
in going for the last yearandahalf into places where it isn't
exactly popular to say it and say I wanted to reform the welfare
system I wanted to toughen child support I wanted to require people
to work I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the
use of guns on the streets and I wanted to change all that  But if
you're going to summon people to greater responsibility you have to
reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity
Applause

	     The young people we propose to put to work under our
program will spend  hours learning basic skills such as math
reading writing  either on the job in the classroom  They will
stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat  They will have a
sense of accomplishment  It will literally be a summer challenge
but a challenge that will take them into a different life

	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even
as I as your President support your effort  At the end of the
summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate  We'll
see whether they instead of falling behind over the summer
academically as too many young people do they stayed even or moved
ahead  I suspect that they will

	     This summer Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I
will be visiting many of your communities  We'll really try to learn
from you which of these efforts are working what we should do next
summer how we can build it in to what goes on during the school
year how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that
we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing  so
that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private
investments as well

	     We want to honor the companies and the communities the
business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this
summer  And again I want to say to all of you in private business
who have matched our effort I thank you  And to all of you who
haven't and those across the country who may listen or learn about
this event today I want to implore other private employers to
stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this
summer  I'm telling you we cannot go through another  years when
we don't give these children anything to say yes to  If we exhort
them to do right we've got to be able to reward them  Applause

	     When the other speakers were talking I was sitting up
here on the platform listening and reveling  And they got talking
about work and I got to thinking about all the different things I've
done to make a living in my life  When I was  I made a very
foolish shortterm business investment  I set up a comic book stand
and sold two trunks full of comic books  Made more money than I had
ever had in my life  But if I had saved those trunks they'd be
worth  today  Laughter

	     That does not mean young people should not be
entrepreneurial  It just means that you can't foresee a generation
ahead  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and
worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership
And I've done a lot of different things for a living  Some
people say I got into politics to escape work  Laughter

	     I learned something from every job I ever had  But I
grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul
without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a
job  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to
people is get an education and you'll be all right  You'll get a
job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year  Now
I live in a generation full of people most of whom don't make any
more money in real dollars than they did  years ago and they're
working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life
And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these
young people want

	     Now I want to close by reemphasizing these two things
It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration
pursues or how much productivity increases there are in the private
sector if young Americans don't get a good education don't learn
how to work and can't be productive those jobs will not be created
in this country  Machines will do the work or the work will be done
offshore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a
third or a fourth or a fifth the wages  So nothing we can do
economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of
America's work force  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just
kidding

	     On the other hand we need to be honest  Every wealthy
country in the world including the United States is having
difficulty creating jobs  If I knew everything that needs to be done
I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole
deliberations of Congress and everything else  I don't have all the
answers  But I know this  Doing nothing is not the answer
Applause

	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to
Congress with the summer jobs with the money for the cities and the
counties through the Community Development Program with the
infrastructure money is a small part of a big budget  It is an
attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not with the
economy recovering in terms of corporate profit we can give a little
boost to it give opportunities to young people create a half a
million jobs and maybe get the engine going again

	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in
the private sector not government jobs even though it's government
money  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American
economy obviously will come from the private sector  That's the kind
of system we have and it works pretty well

	     But this is the challenge we have  So I ask all of you
here today to support the summer jobs program to ask your friends
and neighbors to support it to go back home and ask your employers
to make a little extra effort to do what you can to help me pass the
funds to create the  jobs that the United States government
should create this summer so that together we can have this
partnership  Because more than anything else we have to give a
future  a future that our young people can believe in

	     We need to send them a message that here in America if
you study hard and work hard if you obey the law and contribute
something to your community you will be rewarded by your country
You can build a future from you own dreams

	     That has always been the promise of America  Together
that's what this summer of challenge needs to be  a reaffirmation of
the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise
has been an illusion  We can make it a reality

	     Thank you very much  Applause

                                 END AM EDT

                    Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                                  April  



                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS


                          The Briefing Room


 PM EDT


	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I guess I'm just prepared to take
questions today

	     Q	  George Bob Dole says that the Clinton
administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the
United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that
the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As you know President Clinton has
said that that suggestion is under active consideration  Obviously
this is a tragic situation in Bosnia  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't
come to the negotiating table in a constructive way we'll look
seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo  In the meantime
we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in
the UN  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the
negotiating table  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something
the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the
table

	     Q	  How much longer are you going to give them to come
to the table George

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We're working on that right now

	     Q	  It's been a long time

	     Q	  On February th the President mentioned the value
added tax in Ohio  And when he was asked about it later by
reporters he said  quote  That is a radical change in the tax
system of the United States  It's something I think we may have to
look at in the years ahead  Questioned again about it later he
says It is not something that is now under consideration  If we
start considering it I'll tell you  It wasn't a trial balloon or
anything he said  I was just discussing the tax response to a
question  Donna Shalala quoted in USA Today this morning  quote 
 Certainly we're looking at a VAT  What's gone on

	     Q	  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The health care task force is
reviewing a number of options  They haven't made any decisions yet
And as I have said from this podium time and time again we're not
going to comment on decisions that haven't been made

	     Q	  But you have also said from this podium time and
time again 

	     Q	  Wait a minute  Whoa Nelly  Whoa

	     Q	     that that was not under consideration

	     Q	  Yes  Clinton says It is not something that is
now under consideration  Is that no longer true

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I believe the working group as Ms
Shalala says has looked at this prospect but no decisions have been
made of any kind

	     Q	  Well I know  But he said he'd tell us about it if
it was ever under consideration  I take it that now he is and he
didn't tell us about it or 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Did he say if it was under
consideration or if it was something to be proposed

	     Q	  If we start considering I'll tell you

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  If it's something to be proposed

	     Q	  If we start considering it I'll tell you
That's a direct quote

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The task force has looked at a
number of different options  They have not made any decisions yet
The President has not made any decisions yet  This is  one of the
proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and
cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform
the health care system  They have cast a very wide net  They have
looked at hundreds of different proposals  probably thousands of
different proposals  But the President has not made any decisions

	     Q	  Well is the President aware of their consideration
of this option

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if he's been briefed
on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task
force on this specific proposal of any kind  I don't know that
that's gotten to his level  He started yesterday to go through with
the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe
that that's been presented to him no

	     Q	  Well he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him
what his task force is considering in the way of taxes

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No he's going through it in a very
deliberate fashion  There are a number of decisions that have to be
made  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision
making point

	     Q	  If this is still under consideration that's a
change at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee I think about
three weeks ago or so  She said that is not an option talking
about the  had a big argument with somebody over this so I
remember it specifically  and said it not once but twice  Is that
not the case

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I don't know if this has
been presented to the President as something that is being looked at
at some level in the task force

	     Q	  It was ruled it out though  I mean unlike other
options that you've kept in the mix this one specifically was ruled
out

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again this is something that is
being looked at but no decision has been made of any kind  I mean
it doesn't  it's not necessarily material until you get to the
decisionmaking phase  The working groups are looking at hundreds of
different options

	     Q	  If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out
now then something has changed George  Yes no

	     Q	  When a guy says in February 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the working groups are
looking at the widest possible range of options

	     Q	  So something's changed  They weren't looking at it
before they're looking at it now

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I don't know if the working
groups have gotten to that point yet  They are casting a very wide
net

	     Q	  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able
to sell  definitively rule it out as an option previously and now
are saying that in fact it is being considered

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again the working groups are
looking at a wide range of options  They have not 

	     Q	  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it  flatly
ruled it out on several occasions in the past month

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't deny that  I mean those
are the President's words  Those are very clear

	     Q	  Subsequent to the President's words do you deny
that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled
it out

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know about the timing  I
think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say
they stand

	     Q	  So don't they stand any longer

	     Q	  March th Clinton said for the next four to five
years it was ruled out

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well those words  the President
did say that in February  The working groups are on a separate
track and as I said I don't believe 

	     Q	  Separate from the President

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't believe this has been
presented to the President

	     Q	  Are they considering something that the President


	     Q	  Has ruled out

	     Q	     has ruled out  I mean will the President
consider a VAT tax

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again the working groups have not
presented this to the President  They have looked at a wide range of
options  I suppose that if an argument is made he will clearly
listen to it  That does not mean he has decided to do it

	     Q	  Can we put this another way  In his answer in
Ohio he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax
system  Under those  that was the circumstance that he said it
might be considered at some future point  Is that no longer the
case or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I guess I'm not sure exactly what
you're asking

	     Q	  He talked about the VAT in the context of a
restructured tax system not as a specific way to finance health
care for example

	     Q	  Or anything else

	     Q	  Or anything else

	     Q	  It was always in the context of substituting for
other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Right

	     Q	  Has that change too

	     Q	  Is that still his view

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I haven't spoken about those
specific comments  I think  I can just go back to it  are the
working groups  have they examined the possibility of a VAT  Yes
they have

	     Q	  Certainly we're looking at a VAT she said

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They have examined the possibility
of a VAT  Has it been presented to the President  Has he made a
decision  No he has not

	     Q	  What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the
President's appointed task force obviously not oblivious to his
ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line
reform goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has
specifically ruled out in any context other than much later and then
goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at  Is the
President concerned about that sort of thing

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that the President's
concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal
possible  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most
thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives all the
different alternatives  If a decision is made to go forward with
something like that it's certainly something the President will
explain and justify  But no decision has been made along those
lines

	     Q	  What does it mean exactly though when the
President rules something out  Does it mean it can get back on the
table later if a more persuasive argument is made

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That's just  that's indisputably
true  If you  but at the same time he has not ruled it in  He
has not made a proposal

	     Q	  What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open
to it before

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He's certainly willing to listen to
the argument

	     Q	  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a
shortterm tax this year and he wasn't willing to listen to it in
Chilicothe  He's now open to it 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The context of his comments was
that it was not something  he wanted to be clear that this is not
something he was proposing not something he was floating

	     Q	  Not something he was considering  Those are his
words  It's not something that's now under consideration  If we
start considering it I'll tell you  You're now acknowledging are
you not that it is under consideration and 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm acknowledging that the task
force has studied this proposal  I am also stating that the
President has not made a decision on it

	     Q	  But the door is open for the President to
reconsider including this as part of 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Obviously the working groups are
looking at it  Again but the President has not made a decision

	     Q	  Do you know if they will make a presentation on
behalf of the VAT to him

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know that  I assume that
if  I don't know what stage they are it in proposing  I don't know
that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they
should present to him  I know this is something the working groups
are looking at

	     Q	  Do you understand George that none of us are
asking these questions in context of a decision that the President
has made only about what the President is considering

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I understand that and I am
acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a
VAT

	     Q	  And the President will consider it

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I assume that he will consider the
argument if it is presented to him

	     Q	  Does that mean the President  that working groups
think that when the President says no he means maybe  Laughter

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that means that the working
groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible

	     Q	  George can I ask you another question about
Bosnia

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sure  Laughter

	     Q	  No he wants us to stay on this

	     Q	  Let's do gays in the military  Laughter

	     Q	  No he got out of that swamp

	     Q	  I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT
Reggie Bartholomew your Special Ambassador in Belgrade today said
that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked
out  quote  We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the
arms embargo together with our allies  That seems to go a bit
further than what you've just said 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sounds almost exactly what I just
said

	     Q	  Well do you accept  in other words you accept
what Reggie 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the President has said that
this is something that's under consideration  It is something he
will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the
table

	     Q	  Isn't there some kind of timetable here

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes there is a timetable  There's
going to be a vote on the UN resolution in about  days

	     Q	  That's on sanctions that's on tightening the
sanctions

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That's right that's sanctions
And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure and we hope
that that will bring the Serbs to the table  As you know Mr
Bartholomew also met with Mr Churkin of Russia and they are also
working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table  We will continue to
pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option
as well

	     Q	  The question is whether there's a timetable for
consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo
not the sanctions

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The next vote in the UN is on
sanctions  As far as I know there are no votes scheduled on lifting
the arms embargo  But it is something that we have discussed both
internally and with our allies

	     Q	  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the
US would do that  What was the point of his telling them that

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well clearly I mean this is
something that's under consideration and this is something that we
take quite seriously if they do not come to the table  They should
know the consequences of failing to come to the table

	     Q	  Have they been given a deadline

	     Q	  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing
and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least  Why
should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo
when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the
fighting in Bosnia

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I just don't accept the premise of
your question  It has had an effect the embargo is having an
effect

	     Q	  What effect

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  If the Serbians choose not to heed
our warnings then they will face the consequences

	     Q	  What effect has it had in Bosnia

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the effect that it has had on
the Serbians it has tightened up  they are not getting their
shipments through  We can brief more fully 

	     Q	  In Bosnia George  In Bosnia what effect has it
had

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well it's hard to say if it's
stopped the aggression to date  That is why we're continuing to
press for the Serbians to stop  But we believe that over time we
will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect
I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight it clearly hasn't
happened overnight  But we believe that over time the sanctions can
weaken the Serbs  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come
to the negotiating table we'll move forward with the embargo

	     Q	  Isn't there a working deadline George of the th
 the same date as the UN  the scheduled UN vote  Hasn't the
United States said along with many of the other NATO allies that if
the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then that
we'll seek  haven't we said that we will seek 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We've said continually we're going
to 

	     Q	  But on that deadline

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't have a specific date but
we're going to move forward with the resolution the UN resolution
by around that time  And if that fails to take effect if that fails
to bring the Serbs to the table we will clearly consider other
actions

	     Q	  Isn't this awfully incremental

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We're taking a stepbystep
approach  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to
continue to do that

	     Q	  Is there a possibility George that by the time
all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved
their goals and then what's the purpose

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think the purpose is to get the
Serbs to stop the aggression  We are pursuing that goal on many
different fronts  We are pursuing it through the UN we're
pursuing it through direct talks we are pursuing it through
tightening the sanctions  And we will consider lifting the arms
embargo  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will
continue to do that

	     Q	  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in
getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any
campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained  I mean
once they're entrenched 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I can't speculate on that  We're
going to continue to press for them to come to the table now  We're
going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression  But I can't
see into the future

	     Q	  George on the stimulus package House Republicans
say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to
try and explain the details of your package  They cite polls which
show that the more people learn about it the less they like it
What's your strategy to counter that

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The strategy we have is the one
we're going to continue  As you saw the President today pointed up
the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package
will provide   new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner
cities and suburbs to do productive work  We are also going to point
out the benefits of the highway money the investments in highways
We're going to point up the benefits of immunization  We're going to
point up the benefits of Head Start  We are going to say that the
Republicans have a choice  they can take action to create jobs or
they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years

	     Q	  Does it concern you though that the House now
the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The House Republicans voted against
it before  They made a mistake then they're making a mistake now

	     Q	  George does it strike anybody in the
administration that it's a bit strong to describe as the President
did this morning the summer jobs program as  quote  a
reaffirmation of a promise of America

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not at all  I think it's the
promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full
potential

	     Q	  Governmentfunded jobs

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  To give people a chance to work
Absolutely  That is the promise of America

	     Q	  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday
 where does  summer jobs where does that figure come from

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That is on top of  I did look at
it  There are currently  summer jobs in the pipeline  This
will be on top of the  so it will be a total of  million

	     Q	  The  would be created by the stimulus
package

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes

	     Q	  Where does that number come from  Because we've
been told all along that the stimulus package would create 
new jobs  And according to Panetta that breaks down to something
like  fulltime jobs and  summer jobs

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes but the summer  that's when
you do their fulltime equivalence  I mean  individuals will
receive jobs this summer  When you calculate it for the fulltime
job effect you have to do  I don't know what the exact formula is

	     Q	  Seven hundred thousand parttime jobs 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS    or 

	     Q	  One to four because it's three months

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thank you

	     Q	  Can I follow up on that  Did the President
misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money
for these summer jobs will pay for private  for kids to work in the
private sector

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not necessarily  I mean I think
that there will be grants available  That's one of the ways that you
pay for the jobs  At the same time he's also issued a challenge to
the private sector to hire kids on their own as well

	     Q	  Tax dollars for instance would pay for kids to
work at TimeWarner

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think the TimeWarner is actually
somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant  That's going to
be the bulk of it  There could be isolated instances though where
there would be grants to businesses

	     Q	  Has the President spoken with any Senate
Republicans this week

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS
No but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the
White House

	     Q	  At a lower level  But the President hasn't

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has not no

	     Q	  Getting any closer to get the votes

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We're continuing to work on it

	     Q	  Anybody leaning your way

	     Q	  On Haiti The New York Times seems to be reporting
something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup
leaders  Can you confirm that there has been this change and what
impact will it have on the process  And what did Pezzullo have to
say yesterday in his report

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Pezzullo did brief the principals
I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks  I would
leave that to the negotiators themselves  But Mr Caputo has
returned to Haiti  We have received a briefing here at the White
House from Ambassador Pezzullo  And as we have said time and time
again we believe that assurances of security are important to a
final resolution to a broader political settlement

	     Q	  George yesterday you offered some selective
breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities
Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be
impacted

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think we have it for most states
yes  And I think we can get it out

	     Q	  Could you make that generally available

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I believe we can

	     Q	  And could you do it by the component of the
stimulus  In other words 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if we can do  I know
that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs  I don't know how
deeply it can be broken down  But clearly we can break it down into
summer jobs and other jobs

	     Q	  And can I follow up  Is this the information that
Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the
states

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know if they're ads but
they're press releases

	     Q	  Can you describe what those press releases contain

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  All we're doing is pointing out the
benefits of this package to various states  For instance I know
that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire
And I would point out that the stimulus package the jobs package
creates  jobs in Vermont  It creates  jobs in New
Hampshire  And the people of those states should remind him that
this is important

	     Q	  Where are the releases going

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They go to the states

	     Q	  To whom

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We can get them  It's no problem

	     Q	  Can we get it

	     Q	  Why don't you put them out here as well

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think we can

	     Q	  This afternoon  Would that be possible

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'll have to check  I don't know
But as soon as we can

	     Q	  Are you focusing these press releases on states
where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think we're trying to get as many
as we can  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and
we're doing our best  We're putting them out as we get them

	     Q	  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's
schedule

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I was just following it

	     Q	  Are press releases going along to states where he's
visiting

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm not sure  I think that
probably there are press releases going to Vermont  Laughter

	     Q	  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting
Laughter

	     Q	  George as the President goes about the business of
defending what's in his stimulus package he doesn't address what
seems to be the Republicans' main point that you're funding it with
deficit spending rather than if it's so important why not come up
with the funding for it seems to be the Republican argument  And
how do you answer that

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  What was answer is we are paying
for it over time  And if you look at our budget we pay for this
package over time  We believe right now the economy needs a jump
start for jobs

	     Q	  You're not claiming are you that that doesn't add
to the deficit this year

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm saying we're paying for it over
time  I didn't say that

	     Q	  I know that George  But I mean from the
beginning the question  we do have annual budgets and things 
deficit spending will pay for that this year will it not

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  This year they clearly will  But
over time our budget fully pays for this program

	     Q	  What you're saying is that there are savings that
would cover this if it were this year in future years

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Absolutely  That's exactly what I
said

	     Q	  I know that but there is going to be outstanding
debt it will add to the national debt from this year 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No we're reducing the deficit by
 billion   billion over the next four years

	     Q	  You mean you're reducing it below what it would
have been

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Exactly

	     Q	  In fact you're adding a very large amount to the
national debt over the period of 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  But we're reducing it far more from
what it would have been  That's true

	     Q	  Washingtontype reduction  Laughter

	     Q	  You're getting to be a grumpy old man

	     Q	  George has any decision been made about the White
House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming
up in a week and a half

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We're working on the President's
schedule now  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic
retreat in Jamestown that weekend

	     Q	  Will he address it by phone

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know about that  It's a
little far out but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat

	     Q	  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before
the speech

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know  I would expect that
at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups
I don't know the schedule on it though

	     Q	  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in
conjunction with the event

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm just not sure

	     Q	  April nd is Earth Day  What is the President
going to do to mark that and is it the case that he is going to sign
the biodiversity treaty that day

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I know there's been some work on
the biodiversity treaty  I don't know about signing it that day but
I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around
then

	     Q	  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'd have to check with Katie
McGinty  I just know that there's been some work done but I don't
know exactly what

	     Q	  When is Earth Day

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The nd I think

	     Q	  Why is it you know that he is going to have a
statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a
statement on the gay rights march

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I said I don't know if he's going
to meet or when he's going to meet

	     Q	  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't actually no  I wouldn't
be surprised if he did though

	     Q	  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It's a working visit on Friday and
the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of
issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and
the trade issues between the two countries

	     Q	  There was some expectations that a second aid
package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G meeting and if
I understand it hasn't happened  Why is that or what's the status
on that

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The G meeting is still going on
and as you know Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked
about the outlines of a possible package  But we're going to
continue to consult with Congress and our G allies on that

	     Q	    We will not then make any kind of announcement
during the twoday meeting

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The meeting's not over yet

	     Q	  Is that when you're going to make one

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'm not ruling out the possibility

	     Q	     the President's going to announce it tomorrow

	     Q	  Bentsen said that

	     Q	  Yes Bentsen said it would be tomorrow

	     Q	  So did Christopher

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I'd have to look at that but I
believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of
Tokyo

	     Q	  George has there been further consideration here
about going to  sending the President out to Los Angeles

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I don't know that there's  it's
not something we've ruled out  We don't have a date set for it

	     Q	  George you all have a position or do you support
Immigration's plan to settle  Iraqi prisoners in the United
States

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It's the first I've heard of it

	     Q	  George there was a report today about the 

	     Q	  Fortunately  Laughter

	     Q	     about the pace of appointments and says that
President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions
that people have been nominated for  Are you going to speed up the
pace of nominations or where do you stand with it

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We filled  of the President's
appointments  And it's broken down  we have  Schedule C 
noncareer SES  PAS fulltime  I'm not sure what that means 
laughter   PA fulltime  And this is about the same  it's
about the same pace of President Bush  Obviously as you move along
farther once you  each level of appointment actually has a
multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments  So we expect
the process to speed up  But we're at the pace of Bush  Obviously
we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible

	     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the
background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time
than our predecessors and that is part of the holdup  But we're
working on it

	     Q	  Is that because of Nannygate

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that's an awful big part of
it yes

	     Q	  In the story this morning you were at
approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments but way
behind in winning confirmations

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That's where the background checks
comes into play  That's the problem

	     Q	  That's the background checks problem  Because I
mean you have a Democratic Senate 

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No that's not the  you make the
appointments and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all
the forms and have the background checks done  That's exactly where
the problem is

	     Q	  What's the President doing this afternoon and
what's on the plan for tomorrow

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He's got some meetings  just
office meetings this afternoon for the most part on a variety of

SUI'm not wrong that's just your opinion

Opinion based in fact

SUThis is not an exact science
SUAs far as I'm concernd we can agree to differ but I can not stand people
SUwho think they are right and everybody else is wrong

Then maybe you had better sit down

SUGuido Klemans

Guido before you have a hemmorage maybe we can lighten up Ok You
have opinions as do I Flaming at each other will not get us anywhere in
the understand of our respective positions I offer a hand of
friendship a truce if it may so that maybe we can start this
conversation like gentelmen I am sorry if that was a mistake from your
name I can't tell gender you know us stupid Americans Since you have
replied to my wife's post you must have some strong feelings about this
issue I would like to hear them and understand them if I can In
return all I ask is for you to listen to me and try to understand why I
feel the way I do
All the yelling and all the hate about this issue just drives the sides
farther apart till they forget why they started the fight in the first
place If you and I can forster an understand and mutual respect for
each others views than maybe and only then really can we come up with a
solution that is acceptable to us both

  Think about it  shouldn't all drugs then be legalized it would lower
  the cost and definitely make them safer to use
 
   Yes
 
  I don't think we want to start using these criterion to determine
  legality
 
   Why not


 Where do they get these people

  What pray tell does this mean Just who exactly is they
You mean they as in people who do not blindly swallow every
piece of propoganda they are given Or they as in NOKD not
our kind dear Or they as in an appeal to some audience
that is supposed to implicitly know and understand

 I really don't want to waste time in
 here to do battle about the legalization of drugs  If you really want to we
 can get into it and prove just how idiotic that idea is

  Read I do not know what the fuck I'm talking about and am
not eager to make a fool of myself

 My point was that it is pretty stupid to justify legalizing something just
 because it will be safer and cheaper

  From a pragmatic standpoint there certainly is some justification
if it is a vice people will commit anyway Shall we criminalize
alcohol again If the relegalization for alcohol were done from
anything other than the pragmatic standpoint I'd be happy to hear
about it The fact is that it wasn't

 A few more ideas to hold to these criterion  prostitution the killing of all
 funny farm patients AIDS victims elderly unemployed prisioners etc 
 this would surely make my taxes decrease

  Only the first one make any sense There is nothing to legalize
about all the rest Just in case you haven't made the connection
which I expect you haven't the connecting theme in this thread is
a persons autonomy over their life and body Vice statutes serve
only to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous
for the poor as Tim so eloquently put it People will however
take autonomy over their lives regardless of what the government
says
  And why pray tell is AIDS victim in snear quotes Are you of
the revisionist sort that thinks there is no such thing as the AIDS
plauge Or do they just deserve it

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly

Reduced  Abortion is a lot cheaper than prenatal care and birth
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to
carry to term I'm pretty sure that your insurance carrier would be
happy to take your money

Fascism with a Friendly Face Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of
Anyone
Daevid BornhuetterMachen The Madison Edge

The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that
Hitler was original and showed initiative
Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show ABC Radio Network
October  

NLNSBelieve it or not I was planning this comparative review of
Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant The Way Things Ought to
Be before Sahl issued his comparative review As usual Sahl's was
independent and sharp as a scalpel
	My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's At
least it has a fairly popular orginating premise everyone I'd mention the
idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for
delivery
	Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the
most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets Both are
noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills which they both used with
passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions in
fact Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over  million almost
identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April  German
election Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult and
enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their
ideological quilt
	The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening
pages of both books Hitler's example is when on page  he claims the
German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter he bombed part of a railway
line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg being caught in the act in 
was betrayed to France by a representative of his government when
there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement
	In fact the governments of both the Reich and Prussia as well as
the Vatican actively intervened to save him from execution and almost
succeeded Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic
claim in his introduction that in a school or during a commencement
ceremony or many other public places God is unconstitutional Of
course it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of
God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional But Limbaugh is
too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that
	Of course one would assume that by comparing the two books
my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern
American Mein Kampf Not really At the time of the first German version
of Mein Kampf Hitler was just four months out of prison June 
and trying to reorganize the Nazis He used the book to build his dozen
million followers Limbaugh on the other hand came up with his book
after building his dozen million Twelve million went a longer way in
Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States
	Thus the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily
threehour radio show is the American Mein Kampf the primary
propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume and that The Way
Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will a
translation of the same fascist message into a different medium Also the
printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany since
radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of
luxury in  Today on the other hand Americans are more likely to
spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop
 for  pages of transcripts of the same words
	But as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night some
cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of
their propoganda And remember Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these
days
	Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf
Hess is the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin the former president of
ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media the radio
program's production company But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk
show having hosted them in New York Washington and Los Angeles He
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men He knows
that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the
opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him Limbaugh
earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did it's almost worthy of a
RICO indictment
	On questions of social issues there is an overabundance of
material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom For
example

On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society
	Hitler Out of the host of sometimes millions of people who
individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth partly
perhaps understand it one man author's emphasis must step forward in
order to form with apodeictic force out of the wavering world of
imagination of the great masses granite principles and to take up the fight
for their sole correctness until out of the playing waves of a free world of
thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises
page 
	Limbaugh Who needs the media when they've got me  The
show is devoted exclusively to what I think  the phrase with half my
brain tied behind my back to make it even denotes the egress of mental
aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree
with me  It might take four or five years but I'm convinced The Media
will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking kicking
and screaming all the way pages    and  respectively

On Religion as the Basis of a Nation
	Hitler In this world human culture and civilization are
inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan His dyingoff or his
decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without
culture  He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord
sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the
expulsion from Paradise Page 
	Limbaugh America was founded as a JudeoChristian country 
But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or
ambivalent toward religion  People for whom belief in God is at best a
charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools
for the last thirty years Is it only a coincidence that the quality of
American education has declined ever since pages 

On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse
	Hitler The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in 
One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses vaudevilles and
theatres and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food 
Theatre art literature movies the press billposters and window displays
must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the
service of a moral idea of State and culture pages  and 
	Limbaugh Today Hollywood is in trouble The reason is that
Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is  They make fun of people
who believe in God They ridicule the traditional family heterosexuality
and monagamy They disparage American heroes page 

On the News Meida
	Hitler The activity of the socalled liberal press was the work of
gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich One can pass
by in silence the Marxist papers of lies  it's task is only to break the
people's folkish and national spine in order to make it ripe for the yoke of
slavery of international capital and its masters the Jews Page 
	Limbaugh Elements of The Media have jumped on the
bandwagon of leftist causes The cynical journalist of the past has been
replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes  During
the Gulf war CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw said CNN is a global
network We can't take sides Cant take sides     If they don't
realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that
therefore they should defend this nation they are hopelessly misguided
and may I suggest flirting with megalomania pages  and 

          

To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible but
ultimately too depressing to take in one reading
	After putting these books down there is one undeniable fact that
haunts me In the s Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened
Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them in turn it allowed
Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis In the s
Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing distributing hatred to
depressed and frightened Americans in turn it is helping the American
radical right to maintain its power base as the year nightmare of the
ReaganBush era comes to an end hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for
The Fascist States of America
	And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler it is only because the
radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate One can only
wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on

What are you trying to say Please be more clear

TBrape and could very well lose it in the kitchen trying to give birth
TBThat's too bad  We must force her to put off her personal struggle to

TBit's not murderit's mercy

HSDo you also think we shouldn't fund treatment for heart disease since after
HSall those people are in that situation because of their lifestyle
HSovereating lack of exercise etc  What about skin cancer patients
HStanning lung cancer patients smoking car accident victims driving

Man Heather you are trying to make me think again First heart
disease we are all going to die

To answer your question above why should people who are
responsible pay for the irresponsible acts of others One
more time if you are going to engage in an act eating watching the
tube smoking drinking driving drinking and driving you should be
responsible for your actions and the conquences of that action

HSWhy limit yourself to just situations which are related to sexual behavior

I'am not it is just that babies are dieing and I need to move on that
right now Do one thing right and do it well

HSShouldn't we make all the people mentioned above take all the responsibility
HSfor their situation and not ask you to pay for it since they too chose the
HScourse they led

Couldn't have said it better

                          THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary

  

  For Immediate Release	   	     	           April  


                 TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
                        TO THE SPEAKER OF THE
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
               THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE


                           April  


  Dear Mr Speaker      Dear Mr President

  As part of my continuing effort to keep the Congress fully
  informed I am providing this report consistent with section 
  of the War Powers Resolution to advise you of actions that I
  have ordered in support of the United Nations efforts in
  BosniaHerzegovina

  Beginning with UN Security Council Resolution  of
  September   the United Nations has been actively
  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia  The Security
  Council acted in Resolution  to establish a ban on all
  unauthorized military flights over BosniaHerzegovina  There
  have however been blatant violations of the ban and villages
  in Bosnia have been bombed

  In response to these violations the Security Council decided
  in Resolution  of March   to extend the ban to all
  unauthorized flights over BosniaHerzegovina and to authorize
  Member States acting nationally or through regional organi
  zations to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance
  NATO's North Atlantic Council NAC agreed to provide NATO air
  enforcement for the nofly zone  The UN Secretary General
  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY
  FLIGHT and an activation order was delivered to participating
  allies

  The United States actively supported these decisions  At my
  direction the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to
  all US forces participating in the NATO force for the conduct
  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by
  the United Nations over BosniaHerzegovina  The US forces
  initially assigned to this operation consist of  F and
   FA fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft
  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at  am
  edt on April    The fighter aircraft are equipped for
  combat to accomplish their mission and for selfdefense

  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air
  patrol CAP stations within the control of Airborne Early
  Warning AEW aircraft  The US CAP aircraft will normally
  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the
  Adriatic Sea  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching
  the nofly zone will be identified interrogated intercepted
  escortedmonitored and turned away in that order  If these
  steps do not result in compliance with the nofly zone such
  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by
  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved

                                more

       	    	      	   	     	       	    OVER

                                  

  rules of engagement although we do not expect such action will
  be necessary  The Commander of UNPROFOR the United Nations
  Protection Force currently operating in BosniaHerzegovina was
  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully
  considered before the rules of engagement were approved

  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such
  operations will be necessary  I have directed US armed forces
  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional
  authority as Commander in Chief  I am grateful for the con
  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort and
  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward
  toward attainment of our goals in this region

       	    	      	   	Sincerely




       	    	      	   	WILLIAM J CLINTON

Not at all You are apparently just another member of the Religious Left

Show me all these environmental disasters Most of them aren't And the
natural disasters we have had individually far outweigh the manmade ones

Most of your socalled disasters Love Canal Times Beach TMI aren't disasters
at all

So look if you want to worship trees or owls or snails or whatever fine do
so But DON'T try to push the scaredness of YOUR religious off onto me

If you want to see environmental disasters go to eastern Europe or some
parts of the FSU former Soviet Union  This is because they had no
environmental protection laws and were trying to increase productivity
at any expense to justify their political systems  Luckily for us some
of our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws  That
isn't to say that they shouldn't be modified but all I ever hear from
you is that the environmental laws were dreamed up by a bunch of
leftwing treehuggers intent on putting us back on horseback  Yes
there are some of those but a lot of us simply want to procede with
caution

 Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco who
 is next  The Mormons or Jews

Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth
and were involved in illegal activity then they deserve whatever they get
                                 
You are making a ludicrous suggestion

As a Latterday Saint I found John's statement not at all ludicrous

Please allow me to explain myself  In  the governor of Missouri
governor Boggs issued his socalled Mormon extermination order  The
only crime illegal activity the Latterday Saints had committed was
their religious affiliation their antislave stance Missouri still
allowed slave practices and their growing numbersinfluence in Missouri

I guess the Mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bow
to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities This disobedience
brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements

In the s the socalled UtahWar was forced upon the early Mormon
settlers and their illegal activities consisted no less in living as
their conscience dictated and to be sovereignindependant in Utah's
or Deseret Territory as it was called at the time constitutional
daily affairs  In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival of
the United States of America an entire army under the command of General
Johnson hence Johnson's Army invaded the territory to restore
Uncle Sam's law and order

History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between events
that might appear unrelated but are very much the same in spirit and
intent  That same mob or persecutionprone attitude is to be found in
this usergroup when we tried to organize socreligionmormon andor
talkreligionmormon a whole bunch of charitable believers effectively
blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism
et al in an appropriate forum  We really must be a threat to various
establishments  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa
tion also belongs in the category of persecution  It is ironic that those
who oppose us point to all kinds of justifications to do so despite
their claims of adhering to a gospel of love

In any regard Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and
I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
lands in becoming nervegas and atomic bomb testing grounds is far from
being trusted or righteous  Have things really changed for the better  I
may be a born cynic but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
case In the early s I believe the late President Kimball lds church
leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MXPeace Keeper
missile maze from being built in Utah yet another inspired decision from
secular authorities  Fortunately his opposition was influential enough
for the feds to back off

Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government I do but NOT without
questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and
resolves  The government's actions around the Mt Carmel compound in Waco
was NOT wise neither was it necessary  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with
John I too wonder who or what's next

 We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise
 of their rights to worship and bear arms  Now we don't

Does that include the right to murder little children  How about killing
ATF officers  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas but
Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades grenade launchers and rocket
launchers  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under
right to bear arms

Who killed who  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to
invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound
What REALLY caused the murder of the little children  Could it be that
the ATFFBI presence has any bearing upon the events  How would you
interpret the Mt Masada events  Blame the Jews  What the heck did
the Romans do there anyway  What business did the ATFFBI has in Waco
Texas  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society

David Koresh no doubt will be described as the evil guy by the
executioners while the actions of all those valiant and brave officers
may have been regrettable but alas necessary to serve some dubious
publicnational interest I guess they are still figuring it out how to
sell this one to the nation

 Of course to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record  It has
 happened before

Please explain  I do not remember Jews or Mormons as a group overtly
breaking a judicious aka nonNazi law and being punished for it

ReadYourHistory  It HAS happened as explained above in some detail
and will undoubtedly happen again Indeed WHO IS NEXT  Socalled Illegal
activities can be twisted and bend to suit anyone's need including the
agendas of secular authorities

 I'll bet all you cult haters are happy now right  Just hope you're
not next

 the point is that this law protects no one but the
established car dealers or people with enough money to start a
fairly big operation all at once  Protecting these folks from
competition protects the rest of us from low prices and high
quality

 An excellent point  But you seem to be missing a more subtle
 point  It is not the government that should be the recipient
 of your displeasure but the established business interests
 that influence and direct government action in this case

It is the government that is preventing entry to the market  The
desire of those running established businesses to prevent or
restrict the entry of competitors is an understandable though
generally unpleasant human failing  But without a means to act
on this desire without a government with sufficient power to
restrict the options of the potential competitor the
anticompetitive desire remains just an unpleasant wish  The
government is the linchpin so we seek to disengage it so we
don't get the shaft

Once again Mark you don't specify the means through which the government
is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests  As a
leftwing big government conventional liberal I'm just as willing as
you are to vote against anticompetitive regulations that favor auto
dealers

But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms
to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws
and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay  Each strikes me as a
particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
interests cannot influence public policy  In fact they seem clearly
designed to accomplish the opposite

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes

conscience  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly

Reduced  Abortion is a lot cheaper than prenatal care and birth
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to
carry to term I'm pretty sure that your insurance carrier would be
happy to take your money

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expectsfears one might need
If one is opposed to abortion one should not be required to pay for
coverage of it because one will NEVER want to use that service and
neither should that person be COMPELLED to pay for other people's
abortions PARTICULARLY if one sincerely believes that abortion is
murder

 This past Thursday VP GOre threw out the first ball at the home opener for
 the Atlanta Braves According to the news reports he was quite loudly booed
 No Dr Norman these were not your typical beer swilling rednecks

 Personally I wouldn't have paid any more attention to the incident except
 that the evening news when describing the event went on to comment that
 being booed was nothing unusual since it was normal for audiences to
 boo at this point since the celebrity was delaying the start of the game

 What a bunch of crock I have never heard of any incident in which the
 thrower of the ceremonial ball has been booed before

 Dan Quayle got roundly booed in Milwaulkee last year  I was listening
 on the radio  This was the game that Quayle told the Brewers players that
 he would like to see them play the Orioles in the ALCS

It's come to this has it  Defending Al Gore by comparing him to Dan Quayle
I'd say that about says it all back to the pit with ye back to altfan

But you ARE describing US gun law in a vast number of places

The problem is that the system falls apart when the government decides
not to PROSECUTE under those laws  That is the criminal is told

Plead guilty to aggravated assault and save us the effort of a full
trial and we'll drop the gun charges

So the laws exist and the penalties are as you say but nobody is ever
prosecuted under these laws  They are traded away for easy pleas

Having such gun laws on the books is still better than nothing
What would the DA have traded away in order to get the guilty plea if the
gun law had not been in effect

I've never had to use my gun but am prepared to do so if I am

box my proof of insurance as mandated by Indiana law  So if I got
into an accident and had to whip out my insurance policy to prove that
I can pay for any damages I may have caused will you wonder why I'm
so prepared for an accident  Even where it not Indiana law I would
still be carrying my automobile insurance  I also wear my seatbelt
Does that make me bad for preparing for an accident


of armed people you are going to have lots of deaths as a result The Swiss
analogy is entirely irrelevant there are no social divisions in Switzerland
and almost no incentive for violent crime  there are much easier ways to
get very rich

Oh  Are you saying that the guns are not the problem then


Maddison and Hamilton were not suggesting that every punk with an inferiority
complex should be able to rectify it by buying a machine gun

To answer your question above why should people who are
responsible pay for the irresponsible acts of others One

Don't understand the concept of insurance do you Anthony

What is insurance for

To spread the cost of illnessaccidentetc that does occur in a small
percentage of cases over many  Those who do not face the accidentetc
have peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did those
who do face the accidentetc are not devestated financially anyhow
in dealing with it

This 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances is
stupid  Bad things happen to good people too you know

 As noted in another thread Limiting govt the problem libertarians face
 is insuring that the limited government they seek does not become the
 tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda

 Believe it or not we liberals are frequently as opposed to
 anticompetitive measures as you conservatives  We don't believe
 however that competition will necessarily be protected by the actions
 of business interests in a freemarket  After all in the example
 you cite it was not liberals that pressed for such regulations but
 good staunch conservative businessmen

 As Adam Smith so eloquently demonstrated the freemarket is not
 something that capitalists seek to protect when they can profit from
 its elimination  The same point was made by Marx  a point of agreement
 between the two theorists that should tell us something

I do not want the government to become a tool of private interests
Limited government cannot insure that private interests will not use
this government for their own agenda

Agreed

But this is not a failure of libertarianism  It is the fact that
Utopia is not an option  There is no single system where everything
is perfect

It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams  Just
as Marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to wither away libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition

So it is wise to look
for the best solution  If you  compare countries to see which ones
people would rather live in which ones have less starvation hunger
poverty and misery you will find that they have a more limitted
government than countries with alot of poverty misery and suffering
No limitted government cannot insure anything but it sure is better
than the alternative big government

This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds  In this case
limited and big government are not defined  I would point out that
Lebanon Somalia and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations
with limited government while the US Canada and nations in Western
Europe where people would rather live are often pointed out as
nations with big government from a libertarian point of view

The argument is not between those who want limited government and those
who want unlimited government  It is between those who believe
government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and
those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical
grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds

I would be upset that although abortions would continue they would be
a lot more expensive for the rich and a lot less safe for the poor

So now things are supposed to be legal just to keep their cost down
and the safety factor high

In the case of victimless crimes yes I think so

Think about it  If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone it's very
clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral  On the
other hand if I smoke grass or have sex with a consenting adult in a
manner illegal in that state the morality or immorality of that act is
merely a lifestyle choice it doesnt clearly hurt anyone else  IMO if
such an act doesnt hurt another person it should not be interfered with

Think about it  shouldn't all drugs then be legalized it would lower
the cost and definitely make them safer to use

I think so  And I don't use drugs outside of the legal ones alcohol

	I've never seen CNN give out the poll questions on the air
If you sent them a letter asking for them you might get them  Here's
my guess of how part of a session might look

Question Do you approve of Clinton's performance
Answer No
Questions Do you disapprove due to the gays in the military issue
Answer Yes

Conclusion Clinton has a low approval rating because he's not moving
fast enough on gays in the military


	I think any group truly dedicated to reporting the news would
not use manufactured news like polls

it this way  I have never harmed anyone with my firearms  I have

In that order firearms are important to me  Friend I was raped as a

	A judge denied GM's new trial motion even though GM says it has two

from the fire

	Thoughts

	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed
Shouldn't that be up to a jury

	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM  Shouldn't that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial

 In article SLAGLEAprsgimsdlmsclockheedcom slaglelmsclockheedcom writes
 It is the government that is preventing entry to the market  The
 desire of those running established businesses to prevent or
 restrict the entry of competitors is an understandable though
 generally unpleasant human failing  But without a means to act
 on this desire without a government with sufficient power to
 restrict the options of the potential competitor the
 anticompetitive desire remains just an unpleasant wish  The
 government is the linchpin so we seek to disengage it so we
 don't get the shaft

 Once again Mark you don't specify the means through which the government
 is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests  As a
 leftwing big government conventional liberal I'm just as willing as
 you are to vote against anticompetitive regulations that favor auto
 dealers

 But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms
 to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws
 and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay  Each strikes me as a
 particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
 interests cannot influence public policy  In fact they seem clearly
 designed to accomplish the opposite

This is similar to my saying that Clinton's timber summit does little to
fix the health care problem  Look at the whole picture not just
randomly picked libertarian positions  If government is not allowed to
use noninitiated force to achieve its goals than no special interest
can influence the government to use noninitiated force on their behalf

The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
which I'll address briefly  It certainly won't happen until
libertarianism is the dominate philosophy  What means do we have to
make libertarianism the dominate philosophy  Statists run the education
monopoly so we have to be creative  The Advocates for SelfGovernment
reports  of their Seminar  participants embrace libertarianism
That's the best means I've seen yet  We should lobby for compulsory
Seminar  attendance  in jest

Roger Collins

It's amazing to me that governments around the world will try every
aspect of government control before as a final last resort after
everything else fails they will try individual liberty

Here's a question  what if instead of a true VAT the federal
government imposed a sales tax of say   The tax would only
be paid on retail sales thus not building up at all levels of
production costs that are just passed on to consumers anyway
and would only go to reducing the deficit  I know that this
would never happen but it seems a lot more palettable than
a VAT

Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT
Funnily the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was
never referred to as a tax or people never paid mind to it
thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST 
one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again

The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down
our deficit  Unfortunately their legislation didn't include any
mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and
the money is now sitting in escrow  I don't know what is involved
in releasing the funds but one dilemna is that the Tories are not
fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending
they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by
the end of this time  the end of their second term  years
While they do have chances of getting a third term catching up
in the polls to their more moderateslightly leftish probusiness
rivals the Liberals as in EuroUK the Tories' heirapparent
for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary
Clinton

  Arrested for Defying Judge's Order at Abortion Protest Rally
 The Miami Herald April  

    Circuit Judge Robert McGregor's order prohibits antiabortion pickets
    within  feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice
    Even across the street they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
    or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic

 Several years ago Justice William O Douglas who was
 about as libertarian as you can get about freespeech
 and similar issues wrote a majority opinion in which
 the Supreme Court turned down an appeal by a group of
 people who had been prohibited from demonstrating in
 front of their landlord's home

Do you have a cite for the case  You don't give enough
information to be able to compare the two situations
If the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music
into the landlord's home all day and night then I could
see how the opinion would be justified  But this court
order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying
pictures of dead fetuses which doesn't disrupt the privacy
of anyone inside the clinic

 He pointed out that
 people have a right to be free from speech

Perhaps in the privacy of their homes but not on public
property  Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York
city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters
outside his store  Patrons inside the store could hear the
protesters asking them to reconsider shopping there  how
is that different from the abortion protesters asking women
to reconsider getting an abortion at a clinic

 Harassment goes beyond
 expression to direct attack on particular persons
 in this case the workers and clients at a clinic
 Its purpose is clearly not to convey information or
 express an opinion but to intimidate and do harm to
 other others

Even if the protesters' speech could be considered
harassment which it is not hate speech laws have
generally been struck down by the courts  I don't see
how the words don't kill your baby'' or abortion is
murder'' could be considered harassment

 Antiabortionists have lost the battle for public
 opinion and the more psychopathic among them have
 turned to harassment arson bombing and murder to
 carry on their war  There is no reason not to
 restrain them to protect the ordinary civil rights
 of everyone else

Some of the protesters were arrested for simply praying
quietly on a public sidewalk  Yeah I could see how
that might be equivalent to bombing and murder
Uh huh  Let us know when you get a grip on reality

Wasn't that the 'Bonus Rebellion' when tanks were deployed against

  But also grist for those who think that when such things DO
  happen it means the end of the Republic is imminent   The
  Bonus March was  year ago

By such things do you mean any use of military forces against US
civilians  Wouldn't Shay's Rebellion just after the American

   Hey I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 'sesque touch

AAAAAAAAAAAA  RUN RUN FOR YOUR LIVES


   Look Canada Europe and Japan manage to provide health care for their
     citizens and yes basic health IS a human right which people are
     entitled to  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you then
     I guess we've found something better than capitalism  There is nothing
     sacred about the capitalist system and if something be it socialism
     or anything else works better then I say let capitalism die

Then why are they in the process of systematically dismantling some of
their socialistic health care systems through privitization of key components

   Make love not War

If I hold a gun to your wife would you respond the same way I don't
think so While the age of aquarius may have hit the White House the
age of peace love and harmony hasn't hit in South Central LA nor has it
hit in former Yugoslavia And as long as there are people in the world
who would rather see me dead than thrive I want the protection of a
police force who will keep the peace so I can make love without being
shot

   Contrary to popular belief it is possible to be a male and a feminist
     at the same time  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity
     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong and trying to force
     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse  Women certainly
     have as much to offer this world as men and the day that gender
     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of
     the past few centuries seem like reform bills  I look forward to it

The ultimate statement for equal rights something many of the feminazis
have forgotten is I do not care if you are either a man or a woman
I do not care if you are black or white I do not care if you are gay
or straight Once you can honistly say I do not care about color
race or gender or sexual preference then we will truly be on the
right track

Keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along
Get real So long as you try to make me care if you are black female
or whatever I am going to continue to balk It's natural human behaviour

But the moment employers searching for employees banks looking to lend
money and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly
say I do not care about your color race gender or sexual preferences
I instend instead to treat you as a human being crap like last year's
riots will continue to happen

   HEY MAN ACADAMIA RULES

Barf

You mean the same economic theorists who say things like for the sake
of convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is
no wealth creation now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis in
real life

Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory Look in the first chapter
of that book introducing the field of macroeconomic theory Right there
in chapter  section  is a statement like the following

	As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation
	especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently
	the province of individuals who create new inventions and
	discover new ideas we will assume for the rest of this
	book that there is no wealth creation

	We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world
	however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently
	unpredictable subject is impossible Even though we assume
	no wealth creation we do believe that for most mathematical
	economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid
	as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested

So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now
assuming that wealth creation does not exists They are borrowing an
idea from the Hitchhiker's Guide too advanced to think of these simple
things

To be honist I would rather have an engineer with years of experience
building bridges design the next bridge rather than a theoretical
physicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job

    It is very difficult for a young person to develop and build
    a positive view of themself when they are constantly being

Yes that is most certainly true However the paragrapgh reflects a valueless
position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to
have a positive view of one's self

This of course is foolish

Should a mass murderer a pedophile a year old pyromaniac have a positive
view of themselves

Of course not

A person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn
and IF you believe in the concept of society then your only choice is
to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves

So  the Jury will be making its announcement at  AM Saturday
morning Pacific Time   AM Eastern Time Why such an ungodly
hour

Maybe by making the announcement at  AM on the west coast
they figure all the rioters will be asleep giving the troops
time to move into place

Since the actual verdicts were not known by the authorities it was
smart not to allow Friday night for fighting sorry Elton and to
seal them for this morning  Also it allows for maximum daylight to
wear down and frustrate any potential troublemakers as well as give
more preparation time

I guess we can look forward to a weekend of rioting eh

Are you a local news intern 

The Mayor of Los Angeles in a press conference about  AM
Saturday morning 

Actually that was  PM 'cos it was shown live on our  PM news
and cut into CNN's  O'clock Sports sorry but I didn't watch
the DevilsIslanders game  No SportsChannel 

Meanwhile following the announcement of the jury's verdict the
judge jury and assorted court personnel will be evacuated from the
building via helicopters landing on the roof of the courthouse They
can't  even walk out through the front door with their heads held
high

We had cutovers to LA's KNBC on our WNBC and I didn't recall this
detail  But I'll not comment further on that 

Won't the rioters have a surprise waiting for them when they wake
up later today

A netcontact in LA tells me that the alert will remain over this
weekend as some elements may find excuse over the notguilty verdicts
on three of five charges the aidingandabetting  Those acquittals
seem to balance out the fact that Rodney King himself was not any kind
of angel that night speeding and fleeing et al  However   Another
consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on
the excessive force charges Koons for incompetance and Powell for
overreacting  both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops
interviewed that might get out of hand   Also some elements
may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops a dumb
move obviously  And Koreans are still scared and certain people
are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year

A Commander from Nassau Long Island was questioned about how his
people would have handled Rodney King and he said We'd have let
him roll around in the dirt 'til he got tired then handcuff him

If the VAT will be done in the same way that state and local sales
taxes are done nothing will be on the sticker  The cleark ringing

another  on top of the state and local sales taxes and that won't
include any of the VAT from previous levels of sales


There is no need to include the VAT from previous levels because
the VAT is a difference taxif the VAT is X than the amount
of tax the government receives through all the levels is X of
the purchase price of the end consumer  At the intervening levels
only the difference between the VAT paid out and the VAT received
is remitted to the government

Here's a question  what if instead of a true VAT the federal
government imposed a sales tax of say   The tax would only
be paid on retail sales thus not building up at all levels of
production costs that are just passed on to consumers anyway
and would only go to reducing the deficit  I know that this
would never happen but it seems a lot more palettable than
a VAT

A VAT is infinitely preferable to a retail sails tax

Just to follow up on Casper's posting I have been following this business
since it started  days ago  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt
Carmel location for some years and their neighbors you know the people
next door have said to a man that the BD folks were quiet and never
bothered anybody

There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within the
movement but how does this bring in the Feds In particular what interest
would ATF have in child abuse OK It was the allegation of possesing
illegal automatic weapons  A search warrant could have been obtained
properly only on probable cause This means that some evidence that an
illegal auto weapon was shipped in or an illegal kit for converting
semiauto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped

In either case how does this require an NOKNOCK warrent with a bunch of
macho hot dog assholes busting into the place without identifying
themselves Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway It is no
surprise they shot when invaded Hell I am not a religious extremist and I
might have done the same myself If the DEA busted into my house by
mistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand I would
shoot first and wonder later

So if it was illegal guns the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant
how can you flush a  calibre machine gun down the toilet and
presented it in a peaceful normal way David Koresh has had brushes with
the law even standing trial for attempted murder in which he was
acquitted In every prior brush with the law Koresh and his people acted
peacibly There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks to
indicate that they were any danger to society

NOTE The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists or
slight daft is totally irrelevant It is not against the law to be
looney or zany

Look and learn folks And be VERY afraid

In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the
scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political
implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome Thus it
is tangentially relevant to sochistory and altrevisionism but I have directed
followups to tpm since it is principally consideration of the political
lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with


In article Apronebalmanacbcca kmcvayonebalmanacbcca Ken Mcvay writes

As Dawidowicz points out in The Holocaust and the Historians Harvard
University Press 

the nadir in Hitlerology is reached by David Irving's Hitler's
War An amateur historian whose reputation as a German apologist and
as a writer without regard for accuracy or truth won him a measure of
notoriety  Irving produced a page work intended to show that Hitler
was kind to his animals and to his secretaries that he was probably the
weakest leader Germany has known in this century and that he did not
murder the Jews or even wish to do so but that the murder was committed
behind his back without his knowledge or consent

Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case Does
this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder
because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent
supporter

One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system
was far more evil than any single member Once created the NAZI party
itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide there was
noone within it strong enough to prevent it Remember that Hitler did not
originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it
until his oratory allowed the party to come to power Had Hitler reneged
upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of
his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the
old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications
of their rhetoric

This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must
be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs The idea that one race
of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of
humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome
the gas chambers of Auschwitz

The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who
lead an entire country astray beyond the evil of individuals there was the
evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating
Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego
cult centered on the demonstration of his own power this does not however
mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and
his propagandists worked so hard to assert The myth that racism can
produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be
emphatically rejected In the same way we must accept a distinction between
a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to
govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best I would accept only the
latter as a strong government since most displays of strength are made
necessary by an essential weakness

It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they
amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples They acted in the
same manner as the Spanish Inquisition  murder and torture in the cause
of morality The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms not in their
logic nor in their implementation of those axioms Thus all such parties
such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert
the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are advocates
of a system that would commit genocide

The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is
inescapable from the historical record It is important though to not let
the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that
were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent The evils of
the concept of race supremacy are primary Although this most emphaticaly
does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary

No matter what the promises made by a racist supremacist party upon
election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit
If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made
the pledges that will occur Hatred is a supreme justifier It also creates
a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign For many
in government politics is a method of providing a justification for
their own existence through a demonstration of their importance A
rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the
continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the
essential impotence of the politician Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli
which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power It is important
to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right
and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement
of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice
In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through
their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology

It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics
of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants The
leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do
so voluntarily are required to stive to do so Thus to take on such a
task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of
ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime Furthermore
in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole
before personal concerns even of personal security

Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs based upon hatred
and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit
genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded Each member of
the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility
of changing the dynamic Realising that the individual cannot hope to
control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot
affect the system

So  the Jury will be making its announcement at  AM Saturday
morning Pacific Time   AM Eastern Time Why such an ungodly
hour

I guess its because the news is not what the government wanted to hear
Either the police officers have been found innocent  or  after a week
the jury is hung  neither good news from the government's point of
view as they desparately needed some scapegoats in Los Angeles

Wrong on both accounts

Maybe by making the announcement at  AM on the west coast they
figure all the rioters will be asleep giving the troops time to move
into place

No one is a rioter until they participate in a riot which is
unlikely to happen now

Most of the people in LA are likely to have gotten up early to
listen to the court announcement

I guess we can look forward to a weekend of rioting eh

Sorry to disappoint you but this seems unlikely

The Mayor of
Los Angeles in a press conference about  AM Saturday morning in
announcing that the jury would give its verdict later this morning
just an hour away as I write this would not say what that verdict
is but I think he was told  in his press conference he said
anyone rioting will be stopped dead in their tracks 

I don't think he was told
However his statement was still appropriate

Meanwhile following the announcement of the jury's verdict the
judge jury and assorted court personnel will be evacuated from the
building via helicopters landing on the roof of the courthouse They
can't  even walk out through the front door with their heads held
high

Jury duty is a solemn duty to be taken seriously  It is not meant
to be a source of pride or instant fame

Won't the rioters have a surprise waiting for them when they wake up
later today

Well the many people who got up early to go to the court to hear
the verdict found that justice was served  Given your dire and
cynical predictions I imagine that it is you who will be surprised

paprescoundergradmathuwaterlooca Paul Prescod writes

I'm not  I'm in Canada  We have far fewer shootings like this  We have
had I believe one mass murder in the last twenty years

I'm not going to say we don't have our gun problems  But we do have the
world's largest undefended boarder with one of the most gunhappy countries
in the world  I think Canada illustrates that gun control does have an
effect  In fact it's suprising that there is any difference considering
how easy it is to smuggle a gun from the US

Yes it's amazing isn't it In fact it should tell you that gun control
is NOT the reason your crime rate is low since any idiot can smuggle guns
into Canada from the US at any time

I think Paul was trying to make the point that any idiot doesn't  There are
surely some idiots who do smuggle guns but Paul seems to feel that the exis
tence of stricter gun control laws has had a deterrent effect

       This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's
violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the US  Our
nongun crime rate is greater than their entire crime rate  It
would seem strange to suggest that it to were the result of gun
control laws

       I think if we looked we'd find very specific cultural and
enforcement reasons why the nongun rate is low as well and then
that reasons could be applied to the withgun rates as easily

Given that most
criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who
purchase them legally having more restrictions on legal possession does
seem to have the effect of reducing gunrelated crimes

       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished
because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a
crime with it a silly solution it still doesn't address the
question of Canada  Which is now by the way blaming their rising
guncrime rate on the US  Strange that the border used to magically
keep the guns out but now isn't

It certainly makes
sense that it would  Well it makes sense to some of us anyway  

       The other side of the coin of course is that far illegal drugs
are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally
I've still not been convinced that guns a commodity which criminals
have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources
stolen either from police military or civilian we wouldn't simply
see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as
well since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there

If you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics you would
realize that
  our nongun crime rate is also very high so guns per se are not the issue

Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and
Vancouver BC  The nongun rates were roughly the same for both cities  The
difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gunrelated

        And as was not pointed out in the study but in critiques
of it two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come
to mind it was pointed out that the difference was also almost
entirely minority related  That is the gun crime rate skyrocketed
for poor minorities Blacks and Hispanics primarily while when you
compared the white majority they were virutally identical

        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs
nonminority percentages but failed to take into account the relative
conditions of those minorities  That there was an eqaul percentage of
nomnwhites was about as far as they went  They failed to take into
account that the nonwhites in either city were not living in the
same conditions

        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns
then we'd expect that the white rates the two groups which are
arguably fairly comparative in the two cities would have a far
higher rate in Seattle  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only
not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded but slightly
lower

  violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city

Surprise  Pick the area with the highest incidence of poverty drug use disease
etc  Since rates are lower in suburbia us middle class folks can ignore the
problem


       The point is of course that many of the US innercity
problems are not mirrored in Canada  As such  if there is a condition
which is significantly different in Canada from the US and violent
crime is highly correlated to that area suggesting that gun control
is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable  As one
Canadian pointed out on talkpoliticsguns Canada's major gun control
in  did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase
in violent crime rates which have been rising steadily since  Apparently
they didn't even mirror the USs very large drop of violent crime in
the early eighties

  most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already

Post hoc ergo propter hoc  Those areas implemented gun control because of
the high rates

       True only to a certain extent  Take Washington DC where
gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true but that
crime proceeded to explode afterwards  Similarly for New York

       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high
or low  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact
violent crime  Since it's gone up in those areas often faster than it
was going up before you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by
saying gun control was caused by it  Yes gun control may be instituted
to deal with high crime  But if the crime is not positively impacted you
can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of
that gun control since much of that crime rate increased after gun control
was implemented just as happened in Canada

Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control

       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent
of gun control

And the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in
Washington DC may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there

       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what
others did with their guns and suddenly the police found nobody would
sell to them

Well yes and no The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore
difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them

       There are a couple of ways to look at them  One is We want
you to support this Constitution so we'll say anything that we think
will appeal to you or the more straightforward This is why we think
what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea

       You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation

The point is that they did not make pains to point out where the consitution
may have been aginst the new yorker's interests Also they did not want
to raise opposition by basing their advocacy on unpopular principles

       Horrors appealing to popular principles  Can we perhaps as the
question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal
to the principles rather than as you appear to believe it was written
with something else in mind and propoganda put out by its supporters

       But let's be honest about something here  When was the last time
you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments

       Or are they simply propogranda  We can't know what Phill really
means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince

       Well I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist and
probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules
But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions
on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the
government

I don't propose that any means exists for determining their true opinions
Thus their true opinions died with them and are of little help today

Their opinions have not the slightest bearing on the matter though only their
arguments These are true or false regardless of who said them or why

       If they're true or false regardles of why they were said why
on earth did you make a point of calling them propogranda  That
would seem to be irrelevent

The
difficulty that most US posters seem to have is in considering that their
arguments may have been flawed or no longer apply to modern societies

       Oh I have no argument with questioning them  I don't believe
they no longer apply but that's because I think most of them were
good arguments  I'm not entirely happy about the situation because
they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time but I don't
think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them

If they were alive today the one opinion we could count upon these men to
express is that a careful study of the mechanisms of government is necessary
and that an ongoing improvement of the same is required They gave their
opinions in certain areas and have been proved right In other areas they
got it wrong They ensured that there was a mechanism to adapt and improve
the consititution this can only happen if there is a willingness to accept that
the structural problems within the US political system may require
constitutional change as a solution

       Since the US constitution is the basis for the US political
system most changes in it would require Constitutional change  In this
particular case however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure
and tradition  It only should have been made part of the Constitution 

       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords than
we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also
In fact they both were because the British government had much
greater power than did the American system

In principle no in practice yes

        In principle no  That they had less power of that they should have
had less power

The British government today is theoreticaly
dependent on the will of the Monarch By convention any monarch seeking to
exercise that power is deposed The subtly is that the Prime Minister is
not able to identify their politics with the national interest in the same
manner that US Presidents regularly do

        Phill we're discusing the power of legislative houses  While
the Prime Minister is member of Parliament he is more analgous although
badly to the US President

        Now please explain to me how the US House of Representatives
is in principle more powerful than the House of Lords or the Senate
but in practice is less  Are you suggesting that the writers of the
Constitution really intended for them to be more powerful but gosh
darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put
those extra restrictions on the Senate in

       I disagree  The system is not too slow it was simply designed to
handle less than it has demanded that it handle  As somebody in Washington
put it whose name I forget Congress has become everybody's city
council

One reason for that is that at every level the government is rendered unable
to come to decisions These decisions are pushed up to the next higher level
instead

      Not at all  As any entry level political science course will tell
you people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of
government to attack which presents them with the best chance of
getting what they want  With national interest groups it is simply
a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a
law rather than the states  Less people to persuade and less
contributions to make

      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at
the Federal level  Simply because if they win that battle all the little
state battlefields are won by extension  The same extends to insurance
medicine and most other questions

      Local government has not failed in that it hasn't done what it
should but that it is dominated by local interests  Thus nonlocal
interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their
rules past the local government  Thus since they've got more clout
only in the wrong place they appeal to the next higher level because
it can impose its will on the lower

      I mean let's get real here  Do we really need the Congres
of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus
and such pattern  Or that carjacking needs to be a federal as opposed
to a local crime

      The more people want the more Congress will take power to sell
it to them for their votes  I don't think the rise of special interests
is coincidence with the increased power of Congress

       Congress is more than capable of quick action and has more than
enough power and time on its hands if it confined itself to what its
original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy

If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current
no state subsidy motto they would be better placed As it is there is
plenty of state money being handed out The problem is that it is
distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of
actual need

       Bingo  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual
need matters because political power can be concentrated at higher
levels while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to
in effectiveness

In order to set up a school project in New York state you have to pay off the
other  states with pork  defense contracts agricultural subsidies etc
Or to be precise  of the states since you need  to beat the filibuster

       Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York  I
remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable
of educating its own children if that's what they want to do  And if
you leave it to them you only have to worry about the pork in that
state  And since industries can't concentrate their political power
and wealth rather they must divide it among the states to try and get
what they want individual voices have more relative impact

       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must buy off
states but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork

       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing
but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically
wanted to avoid  Namely a concentration of power  It would seem
then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either
House in some attempt to grease the wheels  All you'll get then is
a system which moves quicker to do stupid things  It would make more
sense to make more decisions at a local level

No you have to break the machine free of seizure before you can redirect it

       But why on earth should we want to redirect it  You said yourself
that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress  If Congres
has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact
national legislation within its granted jurisdiction the pork problem
is significantly reduced

The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility
to come to a decision

       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable
to action thus it the system is weighted against action  Considering
the government the usually the institution with the sole power to
enforce its decisions by force I consider bias against making those
decisions a good thing

Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't
work unless the lower levels are less corrupt In most cases they are worse
not better

       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a they have
more legal legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution
than the federal government and b at those lower levels power is
harder to concentrate  And c you get the benefit of not imposing
new deicisons on everybody at once  You get to see them tried out
without a national decision  Congressional action usually treats the
entire country as a whole yet even with similar problems in different
areas different solutions may be called for

       And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local
and state reps make at least I have a better option of going to
the city council and shooting my mouth off  I'd much rather the
majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end
up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in
Washington with half a million or more constituents

       I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels
are more corrupt

       I fail to see where any restrictions implied or otherwise were
placed on the veto  It could just as easily have been read as a means
to put a check on democratically popular but unwise in the executive's
opinion policies

Since we were arguing from the Federalist papers I would point to them

       Phill you brought up the Federalist papers  We were
arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators
should be allowed to hold up a bill  You claimed the Senate was
suppose to be a far less powerful House and I contended there was
nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this
Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders
wanted based on the Federalist papers  You argued against them
I never argued from them  I have primarily referred to the Constitution
which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for
the House

The
US constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work The
only part where a reason is given is the right to bear arms ammendment where
the well regulated militia justification is ambiguous

       The US Constitution is a nutsandbolts document  The Delcaration
of Independence was the highbrow reasoning  There are a couple of other
examples though such as the reasoning for the power to tax and the
reasoning for the power to grant permits both in Article I Section 

That the veto was meant to be an exceptional measure follows from the
fact of the senate If the President was meant to revise legislation then
there would be three chambers of the legislature not two Furthermore
the separation of powers would have been much less distinct

       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something
it wasn't intended  However I also believe it is inevitable considering
the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they
want them to say  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying
about the veto which is fine but of the problem in Congress which
almost necessitates its abuse

       There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power
regarding what a bill is for  Previous Presidents have used the veto
for any number of reasons most usually having something to do with their
agenda  I am really curious how you single Bush out as the President
who abused vetos

He has the record for vetos

       BUSH  Phill that's absurd  Bush had  vetos one of
which was overridden  Go read up on FDR if you think that's
anything resembling a record

       Why is it not a reasonable restriction  Because  Senators
is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based  If  Senators
feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and
fillibuster isn't that enough to indicate there's a sufficient question
as to whether a law is a good idea or not to reevaluate it

Up to a point the fact is though that when the majority are opposed by
a minority the minority should not be allowed to win by default

       Why not  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system
against action  Historically governemnt action in the US when
dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have
not been successful  When you're in a position of imposing federal
power on diverse people why should the federal government not have to
got through something more than a bare majority

       Why one earth should  be sufficient to enact a law which
covers  million people in very very diverse places and living
in radically different conditions  Why shouldn't a supermajority
be required

Because the bill at issue is a money bill relating to a short term proposal

       Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster
to a specific bill  I don't see how it make a difference

It is not a change in the law where a presupposition in favour of the
status quo is arguable

       Sure it's arguable  Theyr'e arguing it  However requiring
 to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a good
argument  Something that isn't based solely on party lines

       Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power
to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignored  I do not
see this as a positive thing  And for all that I'm sure the Republicans
are looking for pork as much as the Democrats they've got some legitimate
objections to the legislation in question

So instead you consider a system under which the minority automatically win
to be superior

       No I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority
for action  Since US history is a history of carving up population
groups and implementing piecemeal on minorities I feel minorities
should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough
about  And  is hardly a tiny minority  I don't advocate the minority
being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing
the federal system against action

No axe to grind here I'm just a scientist and I hate to see statistics abused

Pity you didn't say something about the use of statistics to justify
targeting and persecuting a minority then

Men are men and they all like sex  I am a gay male  I have had sex three
times in my life all with the same man  Before that I was a virgin

I am a hetero man and have had sex with one woman in my life my wife  It is
very pleasing to me to be able to say that  I hope you have the same feeling
as I do  I also wish that you could if you wanted experience the joys and
trials of being committed to someone for life there is something about marriage
that makes the commitment much greater than one might expect

What in the Tree makes you think we queers CAN'T experience that commitment
What's stopping us from committing to one partner for the rest of our lives
I have every intention of doing so once I find the right personand
whether that person is male or female I seriously doubt that a church
ceremonypublic vowlicence will make any difference whatsoever in the sort
of commitment I experience with that person  You have no conception of the
difference marriage makes since you have never known any other way


Statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero

Don't forget about the culture  Sadly we don't as a society look upon
homosexuality as normal and as we are all too well aware there are alot
of people who condemn it  As a result the gay population is not encouraged
to develop nonpromiscuous relationships  In fact there are many roadblocks
put in the way of such committed relationships  It is as if the heterosexual
community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays
are immoral  My if we allowed gays to marry raise children  we might
just find out they're as moral as we are can't have that can we

You're getting to the right idea herejust be careful of making statements
like the above and you'll be part of the solution and not the problem

Just some thoughts  Flame away 

No flames necessary

because more of them could have the option of living a straight life and

You'd lose that wager if the supporting argument were part of it

Even though this city Phoenix has a relatively small black
population black people seem to be responsible for a disproportionate
amount of violent crime  yesterday black men robbed a cafeteria beat
the employees for no apparent reason and shot one dead even though
they were being cooperative  a few days ago a car full of black men
opened fire on a car containing a young white couple and their baby
possibly because they didn't like the way the man was driving  the
baby was slightly injured  These incidents are not even unusual

even if a white person starts out without racial prejudice as after
all we all do and no one teaches them to be prejudiced it's
sometimes hard to see how they can avoid becoming so based on their
own observations and instinct for selfpreservation  We always taught
our children that racial prejudice is wrong not only bad but also
mistaken but how do you counteract the effect of these kinds of
incidents

what's the answer how can we work against racial prejudice when
incidents like this keep fanning the flames  what can we say to deny
that racial prejudice is a rational response to our environment  is
it should we  Since the 's I have thought the only hope is through
integration based on ignoring race and treating each person as an
individual but so many either preach divisiveness by emphasizing race
or validate racism by their actions where does it lead

	Alan you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators
of crimes no more represent the Black community than racist hateful Whites
represent the majority culture although there are many ethnic minorities
who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with and believe
otherwise The trap is the easy way out
	For yourself I think it would be a good idea to realize that the
demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race
and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement You're
going to find higher crime within any community comprised of any ethnic
group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional whatever the factors
leading to that dysfunction With ethnic minorities it is more usually than
not as I said socioeconomic disenfranchisement
	If for example you lived in an area where there were very few
Blacks but quite a few poorforgenerations Whites you'd see the crime
statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people Would you then
worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable
or whatever The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to
define us and other raises its little voice The trap becomes dangerous
when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational
humans
	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as the or the
most criminal element in many of our urban areas I don't know the racial
makeup of Phoenix so I can't speak to your situation However I live in
San Francisco a city that loves to tout its ethnic diversity Here we
have Black gangs Hispanic gangs Asian yes the model minority gangs
and even a few White gangs The Asian gangs have become a particularly
troublesome element for law enforcement here mainly due I think to their
propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities But ask people on
the street and they'll outof times tell you that Black gangs and
crime are what they most fear During the disturbance in Los Angeles last
year many of the rioters and looters were not Black Some were even White I
remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs
where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most My perceptions gleaned
from TV news were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives
that live in Los Angeles This may have been the country's first truly
multiethnic riot Yet I know from facetoface and online discussion that
in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a Black
riot
	In closing I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points
that really need discussion Our country has spent too long ignoring the
racism and its attendant ills that is very much a part of our culture As
a people we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths and the problem
becomes compounded daily We cannot afford to do it much longer I truly
believe that the  wellbeing of ALL OF US depends on changing our current
course of denial and repression
	I wish you and your children and all other people of all colors
luck in avoiding the trap
	Peace my brother

We don't even allow penicilin to be sold over the counter

Second we already have a big enough drunk driving and alchoholic problem in
this country  If marijuana were legal undoubtedly more people would use it
and that IS a problem  People use it get stupid and hurt other people

  Boy it looks like the WOD is WORKING REALLY GOOD to stop people from
  being screwed up in the head given that example

Issue your friend got his drugslegal or not legal he'll continue to
get them  Issue  why should I as somebody who does NOT use illegal
drugs and who IS NOT screwed up have to PAY for this idiot's problems  He
's
not doing anybody any harm except himself  The WOD on the other hand is a
n
immediate THREAT to MY life and livelyhood  Tell me why I should sacrafice
THIS to THAT

Hello is there anybody in there  You think you have to pay for this idiot's
problem now who's going to pay for the ballooning number of addicts and
all of the associated problems with them  I don't even want to think about
it with Hillary in the White House and an administration that feels our
pain

Look if you were truly for lower taxation and less government you would not
be advocating the WOD  Ever wonder why the WOD is a BIpartisan issue


No harm but to himself  What about when he drives his school bus full
of kids into a train  When he gets stoned and drives up on a sidewalk
and kills  people  When he lives off me on Welfare for the rest of his
life

Ridiculous  I can't imagine anyone this stupid  Forgive me for flaming
but this is sooooooo obvious

Tell me why any of the above cases cannot be caused be a legal drug viz
alcohol or are you for having a War on That too

Now I'll tell you more people are killed by alcoholrelated accidents
than all other drugs combined  BY FAR


Probably because more people have access to alchohol  It IS LEGAL you know



The problem with the WOD is that it has no bite  Sending the slimy
bastards to the chair for selling drugs to kids now there's some bit


Yeah that's it send a kid from the innercity who has no other viable
means to make money and turns to selling drugs to an overcrowded federal
prison where he learns to do Real Crime


Of course this kid would be much better off selling crack to his neighborhood
and helping in its demise

Without drug money being pumped into these blights from the affluent
outside there would be no crime who would they steal from each other
Drugs bring money into the community just like any other business would
except that since drugs are illegal the economy is an underground one

And if those drugs were legal the neighborhood could legally go to hell

A selfsustaining underground economy can only proliferate by a constant
willful infusion of money from the outside  If you take away drug laws
you put an end to the underground economy and therefore to largescale
crime


And if we made murder legal we would put an end to murder as a crime

Kids in the innercities are faced with a very tough life growing up
there or selling drugs and having everything at their fingertips instantly
Many kids choose selling drugs  They sell products to people who want to
buy them  They make money off of rich white kids from the suburbs  Then
they go to prison  Then they become hardened criminals and learn that
you're much better off stealing carstereos in the suburbs because all
the police forces are spending all their money in the inner city saving
people from themselves

What


You can bring up all the examples you want about crackbabies and whathaveyou
The solution never has anything to do with the laws crack is illegal


So you are saying crack babies who are that way legally are okay

No social problem however great is worth destroying the freedom in America
The destruction of freedom is never an answer to any social problem

You can't even walk down the street at night alone in America because of drugs
Freedom my ass

In regard to Woody's post I thought I would remind him of something in
the midst of his tirade against academia
As a member of the generation likely to pay for the crap Reagan and his cronies started with the deficit according to the brilliant Laffer curve NOT I
think we need to look with open minds upon any ideas which will allow us
to directly address the problems of the gigantic federal deficit and debt and
continue to allow our economy to expandand I don't remember Woody and co
complaining about academia while Laffer implemented his policy Stockman
approved it while being fully aware the numbers not adding up and Reagan
completing the largest con job of the century which my generation and I will now have to pay for

    Male sex survey Gay activity low

    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
    examination of American men's sexual practices published since
    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
     percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual

                          etc etc


The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
The median number of sexual partners for all men  was 
     

Sure And what's  of a woman Any hypothesis

   How can you trust a report from people that have no idea
   of what a MEDIAN is

   The same bullshit article reported that  of all the men have
   sex  times or more a week Elf how many times did you fill
   one of those questionnaires and had other statistics that took
   in no consideration different class backgrounds marital status
   etc  No information on sampling were given

Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for

Do you think you can compare so lightly secondary data from  very
different and discutible surveys

straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gaybi men are

It just shows how dramatically ignorant are press release writers and
most pople that read them

Sorry Harel et al but our doctors and most hospitals are still
private in Canada as well as in much of Western Europe

harelbmathcornelledu Harel Barzilai  Grad  Brown writes
		 
		 H e a l t h   C a r e   R e f o r m
			 By Camille Colatosti
		 Z magazine see bottom March 
		 

The singlepayer model sometimes called national health insurance
eliminates private insurance companies and removes health care from
employment The government provides free health care to all US
residents And there are no outofpocket costs

Wrong  In better EC countries that use pure but public health
insurance like we use in Canada rather than selfenclosed HMOlike
socialized medicine  of our costs comes from private supplementary
insurance andor copayments  France Magazine's Summer  edition
has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage
including a sample chart of copayment percentages  For  days
you're covered for  of the public hospital rate  afterward
With extra private insurance you can get into a private hospital and
be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate  The
public insurance covers  beyond  days or the same cash amount
for a private hospital and the difference is paid outofpocket or
according to your supplementary private insurance  Over rds of
French have some form of extra private insurance  So  of health
costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other
taxes  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures
for total outlay using the same methods that yield the  figure
for the US

That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund
is to their credit  I am in the minority for advocating such back
in Canada to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health
insurance  which actually it is  The new Reform Party a breakoff
of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly libertarian
faction hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free the average
CanadianEuropean is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these

I'm one of the few people who favour copayments forget about
leftists even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian
newsgroups to make it look more like real insurance 'cos the 
insurance payment is hidden unlike in France and if you didn't know
it you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine American
conservativeslibertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who
seriously call it that  Canadians aren't worried about the
Americans who spend  we're worried about the French and Germans
who spend  to our   so the insurance is looking at things that
shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for
insurance policies sick notes electrolysis etc  The reason that
the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite
being open and universal is that unlike Americans there is no urge to
spend all of your benefits' worth and more if you can  we're a
different culture

Like the play or pay model managed competition leaves in place two
elements of the current health care system that reformers most often
criticize the private forprofit insurance industry and the
employerbased system of coverage Managed competition compels
employers to enroll their workers in large pools of health insurance
customers Entire industries may for example sponsor a pool or
network Insurance companies doctors hospitals and other health
care providers then bid for the pool's business competing in
theory on the basis of price and quality

Managed Care relies on HMO's which are unknown in most western
nations that use only public health insurance like Canada France
and Germany I'm Canadian and my German fatherinlawtobe says
of HMONHS approaches We left that behind with East Germany
Sure HMONHS controls costs because you have managers strangling
doctors with budget strings

In Canada we use the public health insurance approach as in France
and Germany with all private doctors and both private and public
hospitals  It is all pure insurance without HMO's  The divisions
are different with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked
sickness funds over a century old while Canada divides by their
provinces who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the
doctors monopoly federal funds cover the fees disbursed

With such an openended system it's no surprise that Canada is  to
the US in costs allinsurance is the most expensive way to go The
French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations
in more compact geography to improve scales of economy

FOCUSHEALTH EIGHT MYTHS about National Health Insurance Pt II

    An office visit that's  in Seattle is  in Vancouver
    Canada  That's because among other things they've given their
    government power to bargain with doctors and hospitals over fees

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees

Lack of defensive medicine and nearabsence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
in Canada along with France and Germany without HMO's  the NYT
has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
lower in Canada but doctors takehome pay is almost equal to American
doctors also minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is sooo simple
early March

Part of the deal for using the allinsurance approach like the French
and Germans do hey why don't they criticize France and Germany  Is
it because too many people take French and German in college to make
the accusations stick  was to preserve the doctors independance
Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented the politicallybent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service

You've got to remember you've got a waiting list as well but it's
not as obvious If you're poor and you don't have insurance you don't
    go to a surgeon In the States you ration by ability to pay'

For nonlife threatening things market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand  I have MD friends who can't
make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they won't get enough customers  the CMA medical
monopoly's grip on doctors licencing as in the US aside  so they
must move to larger places  However this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care as has been done in the
US by Consumers Reports health policy studies cited by Prof Dennis
E Shea on USENET CNN NYT etc

Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from  weeks ago about Canada's
health insurance approach on Talkpoliticsmedicine  There is one
small error in the article not all of our hospitals are private

WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW
FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS

In Canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental
care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private
hospital rooms  so many Canadians do end up buying some private
insurance A policy to cover all of these things runs about  to 
a month

Of course the one thing to note is that in the CanadaFranceGermany
case private insurance offloaded the basic coverage to the public
sector  They realized they were keeping lowriskhighprofit extra
insurance for things like privatesemiprivate rooms vs ward
accomodation dental glasses etc for corporate or personal
benefits they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care

At that point they wouldn't even consider a voucher approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff



WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY
ACHE AND PAIN

People who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about
a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical
bills

Still Canadians  who pay nothing at the doctor's  have a lower
perperson health bill than we do

It is free in that there are no deductibles nor copayments two
things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance  which actually it is  I know that when
working in Alberta Ontario and Quebec I was aware that I was paying
for health insurance  eg in Toronto OHIP fees were listed on my
pay stub Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time but only
annually at income tax time built into the tax rate  Only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that it's free along with the Canadian Left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda

The French do have copayments though  France Magazine's Summer
 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
coverage including a sample chart of copayment percentages  For
 days you're covered for  of the public hospital rate 
afterward  With extra private insurance you can get into a private
hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
rate  The public insurance covers  beyond  days or the same
cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
outofpocket or according to your supplementary private insurance
Over rds of French have some form of extra private insurance  So
the other  of health costs in Europe are out of private funds not
gleaned from other taxes  The GDP figures are combined public and
private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
yield the  figure for the US

ISN'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG
AND POWERFUL TO KILL

Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be
politically thorny in the quiet words of one advocate for a
national plan Some  firms now sell more than  billion in
health insurance They'd put up a hard fight Not only has the industry
grown eightfold since Canada shut down its own health insurers but
our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does
Canada's parliamentary system

Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe its
just that it doesn't cover basic care  You can opt out in Canada
and Germany but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so  ie no market

When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance eg neurosurgery versus deluxe
amenities eg having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone's private hospital room they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility  In Quebec
last spring a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that province's
public health insurance plan

There is never any mention of how much working Canadians have to
pay in taxes for their free health care system

Oh really

I know that more than  of an average daily worker's salary goes
towards taxes in Canada mainly because of this free health care
It looks like we are pretty lucky so far

I know that when working in Alberta Ontario and Quebec I was aware
that I was paying for health insurance  eg in Toronto OHIP fees
were listed seperately on my pay stub

While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks
in spending health insurance isn't on the table  See our polls 
A better one might be the July st polls conducted for Macleans our
major English newsmagazine by Decima Research  Decima president
Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers
and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in
the face of impossible election situations  I haven't had a chance
to see this year's version due to our library but previous ones
before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had
shown satisfaction at  and switching to an American allprivate
system had support within statistical noise  The Decima polls are
considered definitive  Even the new Reform Party a breakoff of
traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly libertarian
faction hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free the average
CanadianEuropean is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these

Personally I feel that the universal health insurance approach used
in Canada France and Germany  paying to private health providers in
a nominally free market not unlike America's minus HMO's  depends a
lot on values in those societies different from the US  The basic
health needs for life are not viewed as market but the insurance does
allow the market to address that  basic health care is not viewed on
the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it  Plenty of
room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as

Lastly there were noises about how the Canadian system was not
containing costs but in fact their system is currently bankrupt

Please explain this one hopefully in a way that Canadian readers
besides myself can understand and concur

                    Pittsburgh Pennsylvania

For Immediate Release                         April  


                    INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT
                      BY MICHAEL WHITELY OF
                    KDKAAM RADIO PITTSBURGH

                 Pittsburgh International Airport
                     Pittsburgh Pennsylvania



 AM EDT


	     Q	  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio I'm Mike
Whitely KDKA Radio News  We're here at the Pittsburgh
International Airport and with me is the President of the United
States Bill Clinton

	     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA

	     THE PRESIDENT  Thank you Mike  Glad to be here

	     Q	  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk
about in the brief amount of time we have but some news is just
breaking from Los Angeles  I guess the entire country has been
kind of holding their breath wondering what's going to happen in
the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers  We just heard
that two of those officers the sergeant Sergeant Koon and
Officer Powell have been found guilty and two officers have been
found not guilty

	     It's a situation that's been building for over a
year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict
And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see
the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your
administration and what you're trying to do

	     THE PRESIDENT  Well first of all I think the
American people should know that this trial in my judgment is a
tribute to the work and judgment of the jury as well as to the
efforts of the federal government in developing the case

	     The law under which the officers were tried is a
complex one the standards of proof are complicated  The jury
decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible
for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did
most of the beating  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked
Rodney King but also plainly tried to shield him from some
blows and another officer who was a rookie

	     No one knows exactly why they did what they did but
it appears that they really tried to do justice here  They
acknowledged that his civil rights were violated  And I think
that the American people should take a lot of pride in that  But
I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things
first of all the importance of trying to bring this country
together and not violate the civil rights of any American
secondly the importance of renewing our fight against crime

	     I think it's important to recognize that in the
poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this
country people may be worried about police abuse but they're
even more worried about crime  It's time that we renewed our
efforts to go to community policing  put  more police
officers on the street pass the Brady Bill that would require a
waiting period before people could buy a handgun and do some
other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to
violence and drugs

	     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to
me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic
revitalization of our cities and other economicallydistressed
areas  If you just think about it  if everybody in Los Angeles
who wanted a job had one I don't think we'd have quite as many
problems as we do

	     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the
campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment
to bear in our cities  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown to California to try to come up with some strategies
for that state because it's our biggest state with our highest
unemployment rate  which could then be applied around the
country  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General to
the new head of the NAACP to Reverend Jackson and to several
other people and then I'll decide where to go from here with
regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country

	     Q	  Let's talk about what brings you to the
Pittsburgh area today  There have been  I guess there's been a
lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package
You've been locked in a battle with the GOP  Yesterday as you
said earlier in your radio address you made some moves to break
that gridlock  What brings you to Pittsburgh in particular to
Allegheny County in particular to Pennsylvania with that
battle

	     THE PRESIDENT  Well there are two reasons  First
of all Pittsburgh Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported
me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in
economic policy  We have passed our overall economic plan it
gives the country a very different budget for the next five years
than we've had in the previous   We reduced the deficit and
at the same time increased investment in jobs and education and
health care in the things that will make us a stronger country

	     But in addition to that I asked the Congress in the
short run to spend a little more money a modest amount of money
to create another halfmillion jobs in the next year and a half
to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent but also
to try to spark job creation in the private sector more  The
plan passed the House  It has the support of a majority of the
Senate  At the present time all the Republican   senators as a
bloc are filibustering the bill  That is they won't let it come
to a vote

	     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote
for the bill  And I believe that Senator Dole the Republican
leader has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to
stay hitched  And they're all saying that this bill increases
the deficit  It doesn't  This bill is well below the spending
targets that Congress approved including the Republicans for
this year  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five
years  This bill is designed to give a jumpstart to the
economy  And I must say a lot of the Republican senators that
are holding it up when Mr Bush was President voted for
billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind 
much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs

	     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam
I've held out an olive branch I've offered a compromise  But I
think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work
right now to show that we're changing the direction of the
country  And that's the purpose of the bill

	     Q	  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or
his office lately

	     THE PRESIDENT  Well we've been trying to talk
regularly to  through my White House Congressional Liaison
operation to the senators that we think are open to this 
Senator Specter Senator D'Amato from New York Senator Jeffords
from Vermont Senator Hatfield from Oregon and five or six
others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and
know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life
of the budget I presented

	     You know it has a lot of appeal to say well we've
got a big deficit we shouldn't increase it more  But the truth
is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life
of the budget over the next few years  And more importantly we
have this program well below the spending targets that Congress
has already approved for this year  And they've done this for
years with the Republicans voting for it  many Republicans
voting for it  for things that weren't nearly as important as
putting the American people back to work

	     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political
issue  It ought to just be about the people of this country and
the need for jobs

	     Q	  I have some questions from people who supported
you and some people who are skeptical about your administration
It has to do with their hopes and also with their fears  A lot
of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania I
think some of them are now saying we're glad we got him in the
White House but now look at this incredible process he has to go
through  Look at these problems  Look at this gridlock  And
they're beginning to wonder is this going to work can you pull
it off  And of course your skeptics are saying well I knew
it was going to be like this

	     THE PRESIDENT  Well what I would  I'd ask
people first of all to remember that we are frankly moving
very fast  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the
fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution  ever  in
history setting out the next fiveyear budget targets  So we
are moving really rapidly  And we've got them working on
political reform welfare reform health care reform a whole
wide range of things

	     But it's a big operation  You can't expect to turn
it around overnight  It took  years to produce the conditions
which led to the victory I received from the people in November
and we can't turn it around in  days  But I think we're making
real real progress

	     I would urge the people not to get discouraged
We're not going to win every battle and not everything is going
to happen overnight  But we are definitely moving and changing
things

	     Q	  Thank you very much

	     The President of the United States Bill Clinton

For Immediate Release                         April  


                  RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION
                        BY THE PRESIDENT

                Pittsburgh International Airport
                    Pittsburgh Pennsylvania


 AM EDT


             THE PRESIDENT  Good morning  My voice is coming to
you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio
station in America KDKA in Pittsburgh  I'm visiting the city to
meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs
health care and the economy  But I wanted first to do my weekly
broadcast with the American people

             I'm told this station first broadcast in  when
it reported that year's presidential elections  Over the past
seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with
the people from whistlestop tours to fireside chats to the bus
tour that I adopted along with Vice President Gore in last
year's campaign

             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with
you my fellow Americans about the problems on your minds and
what I'm doing to try and solve them  It's my way of reporting
to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable

             You sent me to Washington to get our government and
economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad
experiment with trickledown economics  You know how important
it is for us to make bold comprehensive changes in the way we do
business

             We live in a competitive global economy  Nations
rise and fall on the skills of their workers the competitiveness
of their companies the imagination of their industries and the
cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business
labor and government  Although many of the economies of the
industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth they've
made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which
our government has for too long ignored  That's why many of them
have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been
falling behind

             We have an economy today that even when it grows is
not producing new jobs  We've increased the debt of our nation
by four times over the last  years and we don't have much to
show fo

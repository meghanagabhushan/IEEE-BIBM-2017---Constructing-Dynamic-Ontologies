 crb Dong   Dong   Dong   Do I hear the deathknell of
 string theory

     I agree  You can add dark matter and quarks and a lot of other
unobservable purely theoretical constructs in physics to that list
including the omnipresent black holes

     Will Bruce argue that their existence can be inferred from theory
alone  Then what about my original criticism when I said Curvature
can only exist relative to something noncurved  Bruce replied
'Existence' is undefined unless it is synonymous with 'observable' in
physics  We cannot observe more than the four dimensions we know about
At the moment I don't see a way to defend that statement and the
existence of these unobservable phenomena simultaneously  Tom

I hold that space cannot be curved for the simple reason that it can have
no properties
Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the
space To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved
is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing I
for one refuse to subscribe to such a view  Nikola Tesla


 ET  Tesla was  years ahead of his time Perhaps now his time comes

CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS

    These issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being
    offered The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which
    much of the net community has settled Please DON'T bring them up again
    unless there's something truly new to be discussed The net can't set
    public policy that's what your representatives are for


    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS

    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary the Saturn V blueprints
    have not been lost They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on
    microfilm

    The problem in recreating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings it
    is finding vendors who can supply mid's vintage hardware like
    guidance system components and the fact that the launch pads and VAB
    have been converted to Space Shuttle use so you have no place to launch
    from

    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and remodify
    the launch pads you may as well have started from scratch with a clean
    sheet design


    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE

    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access
    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an
    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being
    scooped by people uninvolved in the mission However NASA frequently
    releases examples in nondigital form eg photos to the public early
    in a mission


    RISKS OF NUCLEAR RTG POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES

    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to
    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium
    thermal sources being dangerous Numerous studies claim that even in
    worstcase scenarios shuttle explosion during launch or accidental
    reentry at interplanetary velocities the risks are extremely small
    Two interesting data points are  The May  loss of two SNAP B
    RTGs which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather
    satellite failed to reach orbit The fuel was recovered after  months
    with no release of plutonium  In April  the Apollo  lunar
    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP  RTG heat source which
    was jettisoned fell intact into the  feet deep Tonga Trench in
    the Pacific Ocean The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are
    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 
    halflives of the Pu fuel or about  years DOE 

    To make your own informed judgement some references you may wish to
    pursue are

    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel
    Salisbury in Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration The RTG
    Controversy Planetary Report MayJune  pages  Another good
    article which also reviews the events preceding Galileo's launch

    IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER

    From time to time claims are made that chemicals released from
    the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters SRBs are responsible
    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer Studies
    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in
    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources The
    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted
    study Charles Jackman

    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the
    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was
    organized by Dr Michael Prather NASAGoddard Institute for Space
    Studies  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia
    NASAGISS Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass NASAGoddard Space
    Flight Center and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze Atmospheric and
    Environmental Research Inc  The effort was to look at the effects
    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere

    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine

       Industrial sources     kilogramsyear
	  Natural sources      kilogramsyear
	  Shuttle sources	   kilogramsyear

    The shuttle source assumes  space shuttles and  Titan rockets are
    launched yearly Thus the launches would add less than  to the
    total stratospheric chlorine sources

    The effect on ozone is minimal  global yearly average total ozone would
    be decreased by  This is much less than total ozone variability
    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares

    The influence of humanmade chlorine products on ozone is computed
    by atmospheric model calculations to be a  decrease in globally
    averaged ozone between  and  The influence of the space shuttle and
    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible  The launch
    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be
    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about
    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons
    do at the present time

    Theoretical results of this study have been published in The Space
    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere MJ Prather MM Garcia AR

    HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE

    If you don't try to hold your breath exposure to space for half a
    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury Holding your
    breath is likely to damage your lungs something scuba divers have to
    watch out for when ascending and you'll have eardrum trouble if your
    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up but theory predicts  and animal
    experiments confirm  that otherwise exposure to vacuum causes no
    immediate injury You do not explode Your blood does not boil You do
    not freeze You do not instantly lose consciousness

    Various minor problems sunburn possibly the bends certainly some
    mild reversible painless swelling of skin and underlying tissue
    start after ten seconds or so At some point you lose consciousness from
    lack of oxygen Injuries accumulate After perhaps one or two minutes
    you're dying The limits are not really known

    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED

    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion This is
    a welldocumented fact see the Rogers Commission report for example
    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank
    came apart The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the
    astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the Kerwin
    team's medicalforensic report

    The astronauts were killed when the moreorless intact cabin hit the
    water at circa MPH and their bodies then spent several weeks
    underwater Their remains were recovered and after the Kerwin team
    examined them they were sent off to be buried


    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT

    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit
    because it can't get there It is big and heavy and does not carry
    enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks

    Furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of
    that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in
    the immediate vicinity of the Earth The shuttle orbiter is highly
    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit Taking it
    higher is enormously costly and wasteful A much better approach would
    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized highorbit
    spacecraft

    THE FACE ON MARS

    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid
    face It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery
    A much more facelike in appearance and the one more often
    published with the Sun  degrees above western horizon and A
    with the Sun  degrees from the west

    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is
    artificial intended to resemble a human and erected by an
    extraterrestrial civilization Most other analysts concede that the
    resemblance is most likely accidental Other Viking images show a
    smileyfaced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere
    on Mars There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society sorry don't
    know the address to study the Face

    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely highresolution
    camera and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this
    question in a few years In the meantime speculation about the Face is

HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT

    First the short form authored by Henry Spencer then an official NASA
    announcement

    Q How do I become an astronaut

    A We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut since it's probably
    impossible for a nonRussian to get into the cosmonaut corps paying
    passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have
    so few astronauts and fly even fewer that you're better off hoping to
    win a lottery Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fastjet
    experience which means a military flying career forget that unless you
    want to do it anyway So you want to become a shuttle mission
    specialist

    If you aren't a US citizen become one that is a must  After that
    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly
    exceeds the supply  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people
    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length	It is not enough
    to be qualified you must avoid being disqualified for any reason
    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job

    Get a PhD  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands
    dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil  Forget computer
    programming entirely it will be done from the ground for the fore
    seeable future  Degrees in one field plus work experience in
    another seems to be a frequent winner

    Be in good physical condition with good eyesight	DO NOT get a
    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody knows
    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes and longterm
    effects are poorly understood  For that matter avoid any other
    significant medical unknowns  If you can pass a jetpilot physical
    you should be okay if you can't your chances are poor

    Practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in
    appearance and actions you've got a tough selling job ahead trying
    to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you
    are better than hundreds of other applicants  And also that you
    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired  public relations is
    a significant part of the job and NASA's image is very prim and
    proper  The image you want is squeakyclean workaholic yuppie
    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point
    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent
    Keep your nose clean

    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby
    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for nonpilot jobs

    Work for NASA of  astronauts selected between  and 
     were military or NASA employees and the remaining two were
    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison the first black female astronaut
    If you apply from outside NASA and miss but they offer you a job
    at NASA TAKE IT sometimes in the past this has meant you
    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first

    Think space  they want highly motivated people so lose no chance
    to demonstrate motivation

    Keep trying  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time




    NASA
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    Lyndon B Johnson Space Center
    Houston Texas

    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates
    

    Astronaut Candidate Program
    

    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA has a need for
    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates
    to support the Space Shuttle Program NASA is now accepting on a
    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed

    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be
    considered

    All positions are located at the Lyndon B Johnson Space Center in
    Houston Texas and will involved a year training and evaluation
    program

    Space Shuttle Program Description
    

    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated
    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming
    routine The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into and maneuvers in
    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to  days It then
    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and
    flight crew

    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment
    and retrieval of satellites service of existing satellites operation
    of specialized laboratories astronomy earth sciences materials
    processing manufacturing and other operations These missions will
    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space
    station The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher
    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself Users of the Space
    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include
    government agencies and private industries

    The crew normally consists of five people  the commander the pilot
    and three mission specialists On occasion additional crew members are
    assigned The commander pilot and mission specialists are NASA
    astronauts

    Pilot Astronaut

    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots
    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle
    crew mission success and safety in flight The pilot assists the
    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle In addition the
    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing
    the remote manipulator system in extravehicular activities and other
    payload operations

    Mission Specialist Astronaut

    Mission specialist astronauts working with the commander and pilot
    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations
    in the areas of crew activity planning consumables usage and
    experiment and payload operations Mission specialists are required to
    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems as well as detailed
    knowledge of the operational characteristics mission requirements and
    objectives and supporting systems and equipment for each of the
    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions Mission
    specialists will perform extravehicular activities payload handling
    using the remote manipulator system and perform or assist in specific
    experimental operations

    Application Procedures
    

    Civilian

    The application package may be obtained by writing to

	NASA Johnson Space Center
	Astronaut Selection Office
	ATTN AHX
	Houston TX 

    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis When NASA
    decides to select additional astronaut candidates consideration will be
    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is
    made Applications received after that date will be retained and
    considered for the next selection Applicants will be notified annually
    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate
    continued interest in being considered for the program Those applicants
    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from
    consideration and their applications will not be retained After the
    preliminary screening of applications additional information may be
    requested for some applicants and person listed on the application as
    supervisors and references may be contacted

    Active Duty Military

    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their
    respective military service and not directly to NASA Application
    procedures will be disseminated by each service

    Selection
    

    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required
    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration
    Once final selections have been made all applicants who were considered
    will be notified of the outcome of the process

    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the
    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following
    their establishment

    General Program Requirements

    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be
    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center Houston
    Texas The astronaut candidates will undergo a  year training and
    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or
    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to
    ongoing programs They will also participate in the basic astronaut
    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills
    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight Pilot
    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during
    their candidate period

    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does
    not insure selection as an astronaut Final selection as an astronaut
    will depend on satisfactory completion of the  year training and
    evaluation period Civilian candidates who successfully complete the
    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become
    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for

    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCISPACESCIASTRO

    INTRODUCTION

    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet
groups scispace and sciastro in an attempt to provide good answers to
frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth
preserving If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked
questions that you would like included in this posting send email to
leechcsuncedu Jon Leech

    If you don't want to see the FAQ add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to
your KILL file for this group if you're not reading this with a newsreader
that can kill articles by subject you're out of luck

    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down
by rewriting and condensing over time The FAQ postings are available in
the Ames SPACE archive in FAQfaq

    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here The
point of this is to circulate existing information and avoid rehashing old
answers Better to build on top than start again Nothing more depressing
than rehashing old topics for the th time References are provided
because they give more complete information than any short generalization

    Questions fall into three basic types

     Where do I find some information about space

    Try your local public library first The net is not a good place to ask
    for general information Ask INDIVIDUALS by email if you must There
    are other sources use them too The net is a place for open ended
    discussion

     I have an idea which would improve space flight

    Hope you aren't surprised but  out of  have usually been
    thought of before Again contact a direct individual source for
    evaluation NASA fields thousands of these each day

     Miscellanous queries

    These are addressed on a casebycase basis in the following series of
    FAQ postings


    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE

    Read newsannouncenewusers if you're on Usenet
    Minimize cross references Do you REALLY NEED to
    Edit Subject lines especially if you're taking a tangent
    Send mail instead avoid posting follow ups  mail message worth
	 posts
    Internet mail readers send requests to adddrop to SPACEREQUEST
	not SPACE
    Read all available articles before posting a followup Check all
	references
    Cut down attributed articles leave only the points you're
	responding to remove signatures and headers Summarize
    Put a return address in the body signature of your message mail
	or article state your institution etc Don't assume the
	'reply' function of mailers will work
    Use absolute dates Post in a timely way Don't post what everyone
	will get on TV anyway
    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping
	keep lines under  characters for those using ASCII terminals
	use carriage returns

NETWORK RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of
    computers so much of the material below may not apply to you In
    general however systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three
    categories Internet Usenet or BITNET Electronic mail may be sent
    between these networks and other resources available on one of these
    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to
    special 'servers'

    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of
    several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them

    One mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central
    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list In
    addition to the general lists for space called SPACE Digest for
    Internet users and SPACE on BITNET there are a number of more
    specialized mailing lists described below

    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews' This is somewhat like a bulletin
    board operating on each system which is a part of the net Netnews
    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a
    'group name' The groups dealing most closely with space topics are
    called 'scispacenews' 'scispace' 'scispaceshuttle' 'sciastro'
    and 'talkpoliticsspace' Contributors 'post' submissions called
    'articles' in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends
    it to other nearby machines Similarly articles sent from nearby
    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so
    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet
    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was
    posted

    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet scispace group into Internet and
    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa the other Usenet groups are not
    accessible as mailing lists If you can receive netnews its more
    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make
    it the preferred option

MAILING LISTS

    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list and is now being run by the
    International Space University in only its second change of management
    in over a decade Email spacerequestisuisunetedu message body
    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public' to join Note
    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of
    a moderator Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in  are
    available by anonymous FTP Retrieve

    for further details

    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle
    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights NASA two line

    SEDSL is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and
    Development of Space and other interested parties Email
    LISTSERVTAMVMBITNET with a message saying SUBSCRIBE SEDSL your
    name Email saying INDEX SEDSL to list the archive contents

    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items press releases shuttle status
    reports and the like This duplicates material which is also found in
    Space Digest scispace scispaceshuttle and sciastro Email
    LISTSERVTAMVMBITNET saying SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name to join
    Email saying INDEX SEDSNEWS to list the archive contents

    Ron Baalke baalkekelvinjplnasagov runs a mailing list which
    carries the contents of the scispacenews Usenet group Email him
    to join the list

    As a general note please mail to the request address to get off a
    mailing list SPACE Digest for example relays many inappropriate
    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list
    address rather than the request address

ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES DATA ETC


INTRODUCTION

    A wide variety of images data catalogs information releases and
    other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net
    A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access while the
    remainder support some form of file transfer Many sites are listed as
    providing 'anonymous FTP' This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on
    the Internet Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP
    directly but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via
    email Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmaildecwrldeccom
    or bitftppuccprincetonedu and the servers will send you instructions
    on how to make requests

    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames
    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center

    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net The data volume is
    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it


VIEWING IMAGES

    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly
    large and I won't attempt to cover common formats GIF etc here To
    read PDS and VICAR and many other formats on Unix systems running X
    use XV  available by anonymous FTP from exportlcsmitedu
     in contribxvtarZ and the other standard X FTP
    sites

    The FAQ for the Usenet group altbinariespictures discusses image
    formats and how to get image viewing software A copy of this document
    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at
    pitmanagermitedu  in directory
    pubusenetaltbinariespictures


ONLINE ARCHIVES

    NASA AMES

    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via
    anonymous FTP or an email server These archives include many images and
    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list NASA press
    releases shuttle launch advisories and mission status reports Please
    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis

    FTP users should connect to amesarcnasagov  and look in
    pubSPACE pubSPACEIndex contains a listing of files available in the
    archive the index is about K by itself

    To access the archives by email send a letter to
    archiveserveramesarcnasagov or amesarchiveserver In the
    subject of your letter or in the body use commands like

	send SPACE Index
	send SPACE SHUTTLEss

    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important All are in
    caps Only text files are handled by the email server at present use
    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this
    section for images or programs

    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter Saturn and Uranus CDROM image
    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM directories The
    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis Thousands of images are
    available in these collections

    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format The VICAR directory
    contains Magellan images in VICAR format these are also available in
    the GIF directory A PC program capable of displaying these files is
    found in the IMDISP directory see the item VIEWING IMAGES below

    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to
    contact their public affairs officers this may be useful when pursuing
    specific information It's in MISCmediaguide

    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee
    yeeamesarcnasagov

    HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON

    Official names are decided by committees of the International
    Astronomical Union and are not for sale There are purely commercial
    organizations which will for a fee send you pretty certificates and
    star maps describing where to find your star These organizations have
    absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they
    assign are not used by anyone else It's also likely that you won't be
    able to see your star without binoculars or a telescope See the back
    pages of Astronomy or other amateur astronomy publications for contact
    info one such organization may be found at

	PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications by
	Paul M Koloc Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion
	Energy special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY March 

	    Aneutronic energy fusion with little or negligible neutron
	    flux requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times
	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches If plasma
	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds
	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels then high power densities
	    and very compact realtively clean burning engines for space and
	    other special applications would be at hand The PLASMAKtm
	    innovation will make this possible its unique pressure
	    efficient structure exceptional stability fluidmechanically
	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power
	    conversion advantages are described Peak burn densities of tens
	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the
	    multigigawatt electric output size Engineering advantages
	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost I
	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously Bob
	    Hirsch the primary proponent of the Tokamak has recently
	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor the spheromak to be one
	    of  promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather
	    than Tokamak Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority the
	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models balllightning with solid

    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF

    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks
    kjenksgothamcityjscnasagov

    The Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual ASC GC 
    says

	During the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is
	commanded until an Iloaded Vrel sufficient to assure launch tower
	clearance is achieved Then the tilt maneuver roll program
	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
	negative qalpha which in turn alleviates structural loading Other
	advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort
	maneuver complexity improved Sband look angles and crew view of
	the horizon The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff MECO target
	in second stage

    This really is a good answer but it's couched in NASA jargon I'll try
    to interpret

    	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling

    	Then we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack
	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the
	relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line
	between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly
	negative angle a negative qalpha	This causes a little bit of
	downward force toward the belly of the Orbiter or the Z
	direction and this force alleviates structural loading
	We have to be careful about those wings  they're about the
	most delicate part of the vehicle

    	The new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more
	mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or
	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
	the case if we didn't roll performance gain

    	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
	maneuvers the Return To Launch Site decreased abort maneuver
	complexity

    	The new attitude improves the ability for groundbased radio
	antennae to have a good lineofsight signal with the Sband radio
	antennae on the Orbiter improved Sband look angles

    	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a
	helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine

    	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is
	more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east
	usually  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit  Remember
	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction
	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit

    This all begs the question Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give
    this nice attitude to begin with  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to
    achieve that attitude  The answer is that the pads were leftovers
    from the Apollo days  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches  one
    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust one for the Space Shuttle Main
    Engine exhaust  You can see the effects of this on any daytime
    launch  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the SSME exhaust is
    fluffy white steam  Watch for the difference between the top
    Orbiter side and the bottom External Tank side of the stack The
    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's  A side note the
    Saturn V's also had a roll program  Don't ask me why  I'm a Shuttle
    guy

    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics	He added that the roll
    maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw
    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
    stated  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
    the angle of attack qalpha within a tight tolerance  The yaw
    component is used to determine the orbital inclination  The total
    maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a gradlevelmath
    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one fourelement
    array


    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL NASA SELECT

    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite If you have access to a satellite
    dish you can find SELECT on Satcom FR Transponder  CBand 
    degrees West Longitude Audio  Frequency  MHz FR is stationed
    over the Atlantic and is increasingly difficult to receive from
    California and points west During events of special interest eg
    shuttle missions SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite
    for these viewers

    If you can't get a satellite feed some cable operators carry SELECT
    It's worth asking if yours doesn't

    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is
    frequently posted to scispacenews Generally it carries press
    conferences briefings by NASA officials and live coverage of shuttle
    missions and planetary encounters SELECT has recently begun carrying
    much more secondary material associated with SPACELINK when missions
    are not being covered


    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS

    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio

	WFXN   Los Angeles
	KMF    Ames Research Center Mountain View California
	WANAN  Goddard Space Flight Center GSFC Greenbelt Maryland
	WRRR   Johnson Space Center JSC Houston Texas
	WVIO   Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL Pasadena California

	WRRR	         	
	WVIO	 		   
	WVIO	 		     	
	WAW		       	

    WRRR transmits mission audio on  a special event station on the
    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information

    WAW also transmits on   No mission audio but they
    transmit voice bulletins at  and  UTC

    Frequencies in the m bands require USB and frequencies in the 
    and m bands LSB Use FM for the VHF frequencies

US PLANETARY MISSIONS


    MARINER VENUS MARS  MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS

    MARINER  the first US attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus failed
    minutes after launch in  The guidance instructions from the ground
    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the
    onboard computer took control However there turned out to be a bug in
    the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the
    Range Safety Officer destroyed it Although the bug is sometimes claimed
    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement it was actually a
    transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted
    from the expression Rdotbar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative
    of radius This error led the software to treat normal minor variations
    of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation

    MARINER  became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December
    of  and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a
    very hot  degrees Fahrenheit now revised to  degrees F world
    with a cloudcovered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide
    sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 

    MARINER  launched on November   was lost when its protective
    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary
    space Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar
    panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in
    solar orbit It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 

    MARINER  the sister probe to MARINER  did reach Mars in  and
    took the first closeup images of the Martian surface  in all as it
    flew by the planet The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere
    much thinner than previously thought Many scientists concluded from
    this preliminary scan that Mars was a dead world in both the
    geological and biological sense

    MARINER  was sent to Venus in  It reconfirmed the data on that
    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER  plus the information
    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least  times
    that of Earth's or the equivalent of being  feet under the surface
    of an ocean

    MARINER  and  were sent to Mars in  and expanded upon the work
    done by MARINER  four years earlier However they failed to take away
    the concept of Mars as a dead planet first made from the basic
    measurements of MARINER 

    MARINER  ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in  when the rocket
    launcher autopilot failed

    MARINER  the sister probe to MARINER  became the first craft to
    orbit Mars in  It returned information on the Red Planet that no
    other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian
    surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once
    flowed across the planet The probe also took the first detailed closeup
    images of Mars' two small moons Phobos and Deimos

    MARINER  used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in  The probe
    did return the first closeup images of the Venusian atmosphere in
    ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover
    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four
    Earth days MARINER  eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 
    to  before running out of attitude control gas The probe revealed
    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than
    thought This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which
    makes up  percent of the entire planet


    PIONEER MOON SUN VENUS JUPITER and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS

    PIONEER  through  failed to meet their main objective  to photograph
    the Moon closeup  but they did reach far enough into space to provide
    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon including new
    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth All three craft
    had failures with their rocket launchers PIONEER  was launched on
    October   PIONEER  on November  and PIONEER  on December 

    PIONEER  was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first
    US spacecraft to orbit the Sun in  PIONEER  was originally
    designed to flyby Venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead
    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to
     million kilometers in  a record until MARINER  PIONEER 
    through  were placed into solar orbit from  to  PIONEER  
    and  are still transmitting information at this time PIONEER E would
    have been number  suffered a launch failure in 

    PIONEER  became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in  PIONEER
     followed it in  and then went on to become the first probe to
    study Saturn in  Both vehicles should continue to function through
     and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever
    to do so

    PIONEER Venus   also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter or PIONEER
     burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October   PVO made
    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe PIONEER Venus
     also known as PIONEER  sent four small probes into the atmosphere
    in December of  The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the
    atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the
    surface Though none were expected to survive to the surface the Day
    probe did make it and transmitted for  minutes on the ground before
    its batteries failed


    RANGER LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS

    RANGER  and  were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series They
    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in  but rocket problems
    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed

    RANGER  launched on January   was intended to land an
    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon but problems during the
    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit
    RANGER  did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by but the
    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt

    RANGER  launched April   had the same purpose as RANGER  but
    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside
    the first US probe to reach the Moon albeit without returning data

    RANGER  launched October   and similar to RANGER  and  lost
    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon
    and drifted off into solar orbit

    RANGER  through  had more modified lunar missions They were to send
    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact
    with the Moon RANGER  failed this objective in  when its cameras
    did not operate RANGER  through  performed well becoming the first
    US lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 


    LUNAR ORBITER LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY

    LUNAR ORBITER  through  were designed to orbit the Moon and image
    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO
    missions of  The probes also contributed greatly to our
    understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside
    All five probes of the series launched from  to  were
    essentially successful in their missions They were the first US
    probes to orbit the Moon All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar
    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions


    SURVEYOR LUNAR SOFT LANDERS

    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar
    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the
    soil before this time it was feared by some that the Moon was covered
    in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing
    vehicle SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was
    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from  to 

    Only SURVEYOR  and  were unsuccessful missions The rest became the
    first US probes to soft land on the Moon taking thousands of images
    and scooping the soil for analysis APOLLO  landed  feet from
    SURVEYOR  in  and returned parts of the craft to Earth SURVEYOR 
    the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored
    the Tycho crater region in 


    VIKING MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS

    VIKING  was launched from Cape Canaveral Florida on August   on
    a TITAN ECENTAUR D rocket The probe went into Martian orbit on June
      and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse
    Planitia on July   It soon began its programmed search for
    Martian microorganisms there is still debate as to whether the probes
    found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of
    its surroundings One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was
    pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is
    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the
    thin atmosphere The lander set down among a field of red sand and
    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image

    The VIKING  orbiter kept functioning until August   when it ran
    out of attitudecontrol propellant The lander was switched into a
    weatherreporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep
    functioning through  but after November   an errant command
    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until
    further orders Communication was never regained again despite the
    engineers' efforts through May of 

    An interesting side note VIKING 's lander has been designated the
    Thomas A Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the
    lander imaging team The National Air and Space Museum in Washington
    DC is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until
    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition

    VIKING  was launched on September   and arrived in Martian orbit
    on August   The lander touched down on September   in
    Utopia Planitia It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its
    sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording
    one marsquake The orbiter had a series of attitudecontrol gas leaks in
     which prompted it being shut down that July The lander was shut
    down on April  

    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 


    VOYAGER OUTER PLANET FLYBYS

    VOYAGER  was launched September   and flew past Jupiter on March
      and by Saturn on November   VOYAGER  was launched
    August   before VOYAGER  and flew by Jupiter on August 
     by Saturn on August   by Uranus on January   and
    by Neptune on August   VOYAGER  took advantage of a rare
    onceeveryyears alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to
    outer planet VOYAGER  could in principle have headed towards Pluto
    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up

    Between the two probes our knowledge of the  giant planets their
    satellites and their rings has become immense VOYAGER  discovered
    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and
    aurorae Three new satellites were discovered Two of the major
    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous
    volcanoes with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere

    When the two probes reached Saturn they discovered over  ringlets
    and  satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep
    the rings stable The weather was tame compared with Jupiter massive
    jet streams with minimal variance a year great white spotband cycle
    is known Titan's atmosphere was smoggy Mimas' appearance was
    startling one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance
    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings Braids
    kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain

    VOYAGER  thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts
    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune Uranus itself was highly
    monochromatic in appearance One oddity was that its magnetic axis was
    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational
    axis giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere Icy channels were found on
    Ariel and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains 
    satellites and one more ring were discovered

    In contrast to Uranus Neptune was found to have rather active weather
    including numerous cloud features The ring arcs turned out to be bright
    patches on one ring Two other rings and  other satellites were
    discovered Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed Triton had a
    canteloupe appearance and geysers What's liquid at K

    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades Their
    ontarget journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets
    beyond Pluto Their next major scientific discovery should be the
    location of the heliopause

    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter Saturn and even
    interstellar probes within the next thirty years no major steps have
    yet been taken with these projects More intensive studies of the Moon
    Mars Venus and various comets have been planned for the s and a
    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been
    planned for  How the many changes in the former Soviet Union now
    the Commonwealth of Independent States will affect the future of their
    space program remains to be seen


JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS

    SAKIGAKE MST was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on
    January   and approached Halley's Comet within about  million km
    on March   The spacecraft is carrying three instru ments to
    measure interplanetary magnetic fieldplasma wavessolar wind all of
    which work normally now so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on
    January   into an orbit similar to the earth's The closest
    approach was at hms JSTUTCh on January   The
    geocentric distance was  km This is the first planetswingby for
    a Japanese spacecraft

    During the approach Sakigake observed the geotail Some geotail
    passages will be scheduled in some years hence The second Earthswingby
    will be on June   at  Re Earth's radius and the third
    October   at  Re


    HITEN a small lunar probe was launched into Earth orbit on January 
     The spacecraft was then known as MUSESA but was renamed to Hiten
    once in orbit The  lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first
    lunary flyby on March  where it dropped off its  lb midget
    satellite HAGOROMO Japan at this point became the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon joining the Unites States and USSR

    The smaller spacecraft Hagoromo remained in orbit around the Moon An
    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists
    to lose track of it Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March
     but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately The
    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt
    camera cm F at the Kiso Observatory in Japan

    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and
    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere Hiten
    made a close approach to the moon at  JST UTCh on February 
     at the height of  km from the moon's surface N E and
    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into
    lunar orbit The following is the orbital calculation results after the
    approach

	Apoapsis Altitude about  km
	Periapsis Altitude about  km
	Inclination	  deg to ecliptic plane
	Period		  days


PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES

    I also recommend reading the following works categorized in three
    groups General overviews specific books on particular space missions
    and periodical sources on space probes This list is by no means
    complete it is primarily designed to give you places to start your
    research through generally available works on the subject If anyone can
    add pertinent works to the list it would be greatly appreciated

    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below I think it
    would be best if you started out with the general overview books in
    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in
    this area I also recommend that you pick up some good uptodate
    general works on astronomy and the Sol system to give you some extra
    background Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good
    public and university library Some of the more recently published works
    can also be purchased in andor ordered through any good mass market
    bookstore

       themselves

    Other works and periodicals

    NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space
    probe mission it has launched Good university libraries will carry
    these books and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission
    you wish to read about I recommend these works after you first study
    some of the books listed above

    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL
    GEOGRAPHIC which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's
    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn the RANGER
    SURVEYOR LUNAR ORBITER and APOLLO missions to Luna the MARINER
    missions to Mercury Venus and Mars the VIKING probes to Mars and the
    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune

    More details on American Soviet European and Japanese probe missions
    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE ASTRONOMY SCIENCE NATURE and
    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines TIME NEWSWEEK and various major
    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions
    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events
    were unfolding if that is of interest to you Space missions are
    affected by numerous political economic and climatic factors as you
    probably know

    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go you
    might also wish to join The Planetary Society one of the largest space
    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration Their
    periodical THE PLANETARY REPORT details the latest space probe
    missions Write to The Planetary Society  North Catalina Avenue
    Pasadena California  USA

    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration I
    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas
    in this field and the benefits human society has and will receive from
    it are incredible with many yet to be realized

CONTACTING NASA ESA AND OTHER SPACE AGENCIESCOMPANIES

Many space activities center around large Government or International
Bureaucracies	In the US that means NASA  If you have basic information
requests eg general PR info research grants data limited tours and
ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT typically resumes should be ready by Jan  
etc consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions

EMail typically will not get you any where computers are used by
investigators not PR people The typical volume of mail per Center is a
multiple of  letters a day Seek the Public Information Office at one
of the below this is their job

NASA The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is the
civilian space agency of of the United States Federal Government
It reports directly to the White House and is not a Cabinet
post such as the military Department of Defense  Its K employees
are civil servants and hence US citizens  Another K contractors
also work for NASA

NASA CENTERS

    NASA Headquarters NASA HQ
    Washington DC 
    

	Ask them questions about policy money and things of political
	nature Direct specific questions to the appropriate center

	The heavies in planetary research probes and other unmanned
	projects they also had a lot to do with IRAS They run Voyager
	Magellan Galileo and will run Cassini CRAF etc etc For
	images probe navigation and other info about unmanned exploration
	this is the place to go

	JPL is run under contract for NASA by the nearby California
	Institute of Technology unlike the NASA centers above This
	distinction is subtle but critical JPL has different requirements
	for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires For instance in
	the latter an SF  is useless Employees are Caltech employees
	contractors and for the most part have similar responsibilities
	They offer an alternative to funding after other NASA Centers

UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES  MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES

    Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below
    would be welcome Sources NASA fact sheets Cassini Mission Design
    team ISASNASDA launch schedules press kits


    ASUKA ASTROD  ISAS Japan Xray astronomy satellite launched into
    Earth orbit on  Equipped with largearea widewavelength 
    Angstrom Xray telescope Xray CCD cameras and imaging gas
    scintillation proportional counters


    CASSINI  Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe Cassini is a joint
    NASAESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian
    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe Cassini
    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IVCentaur in October of 
    After gravity assists of Venus Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA
    trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of  Upon
    arrival the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
    orbit around Saturn Near the end of this initial orbit the Huygens
    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
    Titan The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about  hours
    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
    surface After the completion of the Probe mission the Orbiter
    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years Titan
    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about  flybys of Titan and
    targeted flybys of Iapetus Dione and Enceladus The objectives of the
    mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere
    rings and magnetosphere conduct closeup studies of Saturn's
    satellites and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface

    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its
    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere These
    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
    down onto the surface The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
    surface Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere

    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini  the
    first director of the Paris Observatory who discovered several of
    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings The Titan
    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan
    Huygens  who discovered Titan and first described the true
    nature of Saturn's rings

    TOPEXPoseidon  Joint USFrench Earth observing satellite launched
     on an Ariane  booster The primary objective of the
    TOPEXPOSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global
    observations of the sea level for several years substantially
    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics The satellite also
    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean


    ULYSSES European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over
    its poles Launched in late  it carries particlesandfields
    experiments such as magnetometer ion and electron collectors for
    various energy ranges plasma wave radio receivers etc but no camera

    Since no humanbuilt rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of
    the ecliptic plane it went to Jupiter instead and stole energy from
    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravityassist
    manuver in February  This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
    about  degrees to the ecliptic It will pass over the Sun's south pole
    in the summer of  Its aphelion is  AU and surprisingly its
    perihelion is about  AU that's right a solarstudies spacecraft
    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is

    While in Jupiter's neigborhood Ulysses studied the magnetic and
    radiation environment For a short summary of these results see
    Science V  p   September  For gory technical
    detail see the many articles in the same issue

    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTHIMPACTING ASTEROIDS

    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula based on
    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests

		     
    D  S  S  c  K  W	     crater diameter in km
	 g  p  f  n

	       
    S  g g 		     gravity correction factor for bodies other than
     g	  e  t		      Earth where g   ms and g	is the surface
					    e		      t
			      gravity of the target body This scaling is
			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for
			      other bodies

		
    S  p  p 	     correction factor for target density p  
     p	  a   t							    t
			      p    gcm for alluvium at the Jangle U

			      rock on the continental shields

    C			     crater collapse factor  for craters   km
			      in diameter  for larger craters on Earth

							    
    K			      km  kT TNT equivalent

			     projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent
			      given diameter d velocity v and projectile
			      density delta in CGS units delta of around

    An RMS velocity of V   kmsec may be used for Earthcrossing
    asteroids

    Under these assumptions the body which created the Barringer Meteor
    Crater in Arizona  km diameter would have been about  meters in
    diameter

    More generally one can use after Gehrels

    MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY

    Two easytofind sources of map projections are the Encyclopaedia
    Brittanica particularly the older volumes and a tutorial appearing
    in Graphics Gems Academic Press  The latter was written with
    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind
    spherical trig formulae also appear as do digitallyplotted examples

    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John
    Snyder's USGS publication Map ProjectionsA Working Manual USGS
    Professional Paper  This contains detailed descriptions of 
    projections with history features projection formulas for both
    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth and numerical test cases It's a
    neat book all  pages worth This one's 

    You might also want the companion volume by Snyder and Philip Voxland
    An Album of Map Projections USGS Professional Paper  This
    contains less detail on about  projections and variants Formulas are
    in the back example plots in the front   pages

    You can order these  ways The cheap slow way is direct from USGS
    Earth Science Information Center US Geological Survey  National
    Center Reston VA  USAMAPS They can quote you a price and
    tell you where to send your money Expect a  week turnaround time

    A much faster way about  week is through Timely Discount Topos

Acronym List for sciastro scispace and scispaceshuttle
Edition   Dec 
Last posted  Aug 

This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing
acronyms in the spacerelated newsgroups  If I forgot or botched your
favorite acronym please let me know  Also if there's an acronym not
on this list that confuses you drop me a line and if I can figure
it out I'll add it to the list

Note that this is intended to be a reference for frequently seen
acronyms and is most emphatically not encyclopedic  If I incorporated
every acronym I ever saw I'd soon run out of disk space  

The list will be posted at regular intervals every  days  All
comments regarding it are welcome I'm reachable as bradfrdncarucaredu

Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for  you're on your
own for figuring out what they mean  Note also that the total number of
acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list specialpurpose acronyms that
are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted
Further some acronyms stand for more than one thing as of Edition  of
the list these acronyms appear on multiple lines unless they're simply
different ways of referring to the same thing

Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of
the list and especially to Garrett A Wollman wollmangriffinuvmedu
who is maintaining an independent list somewhat more verbose in
character than mine and to Daniel Fischer dfispecklecmpifrbonnmpgde
who is maintaining a truly HUGE list  at last count of acronyms and
terms mostly in German which I read fortunately

Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA who sent me a copy of NASA
Reference Publication  Revised Space Transportation System and
Associated Payloads Glossary Acronyms and Abbreviations a truly
mammoth tome  almost  pages of TLAs

Special Bonus  At the end of this posting you will find a perl program
written by none other than Larry Wall whose purpose is to scramble the
acronym list in an entertaining fashion  Thanks Larry

In article CAGzxnewscsouiucedu jbhuxacsouiucedu Josh Hopkins writes
Titan IV launches ain't cheap 
Granted But that's because titan IV's are bought by the governemnt Titan
III is actually the cheapest way to put a pound in space of all US expendable
launchers

In that case it's rather ironic that they are doing so poorly on the commercial
market  Is there a single Titan III on order

The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt
to market it  They're basically happy with their government business and
don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially

A secondary problem is that it is a bit big  They'd need to go after
multisatellite launches a la Ariane and that complicates the marketing
task quite significantly

They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time
to get them started properly  If memory serves the pad used for the Mars
Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had
prevented launches from it for a year or so

There have been a few CT launches  Mars Observer was one of them  So
was that stranded Intelsat and at least one of its brothers that reached
orbit properly
 
All work is one man's work              Henry Spencer  U of Toronto Zoology

 The real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being
 built is that there isn't any reason to do so  Natural uranium is
 still too cheap and geological disposal of actinides looks
 technically reasonable


	NovemberDecember  page   Science and Technology in Japan
			Seawater Uranium Recovery Experiment
	The ground uranium reserves are estimated at about  million tons
 and it is anticipated that the demand and supply balance will collapse by the
 end of the th century  In Japan a resources poor country technological
 development are now under way to economically collect uranium dissolved in
 seawater  The total quanity of uranium dissolved in seawater is estimated
 to be about  billion tons a huge amount when compared with ground uranium
 reserves


I hate to pour cold water on this but currently seawater extracted
uranium even using the new improved fiber absorbers from Japan is
about  times more expensive than uranium on the spot market
Uranium is very cheap right now around lb  Right now there
are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar
Lake in Canada where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
to the mines who work in shielded vehicles  Plenty of other sources
for example uranium from phosphate processing would come on line before
uranium reached lb

Demand and supply balance will collapse is nonsense  Supply and
demand always balance what changes is the price  Is uranium going
to increase in price by a factor of  by the end of the century
Not bloody likely  New nuclear reactors are not being built
at a sufficient rate

Uranium from seawater is interesting but it's a long term project or
a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of
selfsufficiency

questions and issues WRT congress raised and discussed

Dennis Replies
Now black when it is white is just white Except that when black is called
white money is put into the system in a study to find out just when it is
justified to call black white  It is also apparant that when white is called
black just the opposite occurs Now white is a color but when white is
called black it calls into question the validity of the color spectrum

It is a given however that NASA nor the military whose competence in
differentating black from white is well known remember the black and
white paint on the Saturn V rocket That nothing will occur here either
When black and white are used by congress who cares nothing for results
just more money for pork barrel jobs brought about by the blackwhite
controversy

Dennis why must you always see things in black and white terms

I think this would be a great way to build it but unfortunately
current spending rules don't permit it to be workable  For this to
work it would be necessary for the government to guarantee a certain
minimum amount of business in order to sufficiently reduce the risk
enough to make this attractive to a private firm  Since they
generally can't allocate money except one year at a time the
government can't provide such a tenant guarantee


Fred

	Try reading a bit  THe government does lots of multi year
contracts with Penalty for cancellation clauses  They just like to be
damn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year
contract   THe reason they aren't cutting defense spending as much
as they would like is the Reagan administration signed enough
Multi year contracts  that it's now cheaper to just finish them out

Look at SSF  THis years funding is  Billion   of which will
cover penalty clauses due to the redesign

Yes long before Star Trek  Before Einstein in fact

Vulcan as a planet inside Mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation
of Mercury's orbit that could not be explained by the known planets  But
Einstein's theory of relativity explained Mercury's motion and analysis
of Mercury's motion now shows there are not any planets inside its orbit

in essence holding a match under the nozzle is just nuts  One
thing you absolutely must do in such an engine is to guarantee that
the propellants ignite as soon as they mix within milliseconds  To
do otherwise is to fill your engine with a high explosive mixture
which when it finally does ignite blows everything to hell

Definitely In one of the reports of an early test conducted by Rocketdyne at 
their Santa Susanna Field Lab the Hill above the San Fernando and Simi 
Valleys the result of a hung start was described as structural failure of 
the combustion chamber  The inspection picture showed pumps with nothing below
 the CC had vaporized  This was described in a class I took as a typical
engineering understatement

As I heard the story before Albert came up the the theory
o'relativity and warped space nobody could account for
Mercury's orbit  It ran a little fast I think for simple
Newtonian physics  With the success in finding Neptune to
explain the odd movments of Uranus it was postulated that there
might be another inner planet to explain Mercury's orbit  

It's unlikely anything bigger than an asteroid is closer to the
sun than Mercury  I'm sure we would have spotted it by now
Perhaps some professionals can confirm that

This might a real wierd idea or maybe not

I have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them
that then drys and makes hard walls

Why not do the same thing for a space station

Fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such blow up the baloons
spin then around I know a problem in micro gravity let them drycureharden
and cut a hole for the dockingattaching ring and bingo a space station

Of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation
protective coveringheat shield and the material used to make the wals would
have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paintcovering of
the inner wall would have to be human safe Maybe a special congrete or maybe
the same material as makes caplets but with some changes saw where someone
instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture got a mix that was just as
strong as congret but easier to carry around and such

Sorry for any spelling errors I missed school today grin

Why musta  space station be so difficult why must we have girders why be
confined to earth based ideas lets think new ideas after all space is not
earth why be limited by earth based ideas

Suppose the Soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working
and had made it first  They could have beaten us if either

 Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back

andor

 A Saturn V went boom

If they had beaten us I speculate that the US would have gone
head and done some landings but we also would have been more
determined to set up a base both in Earth Orbit and on the
Moon  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend
upon whether the Soviets tried to go  Setting up a lunar base
would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think
that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value
of going to Mars at least in the short run  Thus we would
have concentrated on the moon

getting things done faster better and cheaper  It's unclear to me
whether he will be able to do this at his new position

Does anyone know what his new duties will be

First I've heard of it Offhand

Griffin is no longer an office head so that's bad

On the other hand

Regress seemed to think we can't fund anything by Griffin because
that would mean and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the
  billion mars mission to prove it that we would be buying into a
mission to Mars that would cost  billion Therefore there will be
no Artemis or  million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera

They were killing Griffin's main program simply because some sycophants
somewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into
the same old stuff Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because he's
a communist hardliner

At least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward
won't be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded
ghetto That Griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very
good And if he brings something up noone can say why don't you go
back to the OSE where you belong and where he couldn't even get money
for design studies

Sounds liek what the FED has to do is sign a  or more year lease to use
certain parts of a space station that is built and designed and such by a
commerical company or consortium of companies such as like Alyeska for a
small amount of rent in return for certain incentives and such Such as tax
and other right off and also a monopoly on certain products The commerical
builders would have certain perks given to them to make there end easier taxes
 contracts regulatory concesions and such

Is it workable just might work

make money this could work

Just a bit off Phil  We don't reprocess nuclear fuel because what
you get from the reprocessing plant is bombgrade plutonium  It is
also cheaper given current prices of things to simply fabricate new
fuel rods rather than reprocess the old ones creating potentially
dangerous materials from a national security point of view and then
fabricate that back into fuel rods

Fabricating with reprocessed plutonium may result in something that may go
kind of boom but its hardly decent bomb grade plutonium  If you want bomb
grade plutonium use a research reactor not a power reactor  But if you want
a bomb don't use plutonium use uranium

Any comments on the absorbtion of the Office of Exploration into the
Office of Space Sciences and the reassignment of Griffin to the Chief
Engineer position  Is this just a meaningless administrative
shuffle or does this bode ill for SEI

Unfortunately things have been boding ill is that a legitimate conjugation
for a while  While the Office of Exploration had some great ideas they never
got much money  I've heard good things about Griffin but it's hard to want
him back in a job where he couldn't do anything

Does anyone know what his new duties will be

Excellent discussion of DCX landing techniques by Henry deleted

Since the DCX is to take off horizontal why not land that way

The DCX will not take of horizontally  It takes of vertically 

Why do the Martian Landing thing 

For several reasons  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit
noise pollution  They don't require wheels or wings  Just turn on the engines
and touch down  Of course as Henry pointed out vetical landings aren't quite
that simple

Or am I missing something Don't know to
much about DCX and such overly obvious

Well to be blunt yes  But at least you're learning

Why not just fall to earth like the russian crafts Parachute in then

The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets
just before they hit the ground  Parachutes are however not especially
practical if you want to reuse something without much effort  The landings
are also not very comfortable  However in the words of Georgy Grechko
I prefer to have bruises not to sink

like space foil at the time  

The taste is hard to describe although I remember it fondly  It was
most certainly more candy than say a modern Power Bar  Sort of

SSF is up for redesign again  Let's do it right this
time  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want

 microgravityvacuum process research
 life sciences research adaptation to space
 spacecraft maintenence 

The old NASA approach explified by Shuttle and SSF so far was to
centralize functionality  These projects failed to meet
their targets by a wide margin the military and commercial users 
took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to 
tie their payloads to it and SSF has crumbled into disorganization
and miscommunication  Over  billion has been spent on these
two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement
in commercial space industrialization  Meanwhile military and commercial 
users have come up with a superior strategy for space development the 
constellation  

Firstly different functions are broken down into different 
constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function
thus we have the GPSNavstar constellation in hour orbits
comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits etc  Secondly the task
is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation
providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed

SSF's  main functions require quite different environments
and are also prime candidates for constellization

 We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now
COMET and Mir for longduration flights ShuttleSpacelab for
shortduration flights  The best strategy for this area is
inexpensive incremental improvement installation of US facilities 
on Mir ShuttleMir linkup and transition from ShuttleSpacelab
to a much less expensive SSTOSpacehabCOMET or SSTOSIFCOMET
We might also expand the research program to take advantage of 
interesting space environments eg the highradiation Van Allen belt 
or gasplasma gradients in comet tails  The COMET system can
be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks where a 
station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO

 We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity
but also in lunar and Martian gravities and in the radiation
environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter
of LEO  This is a very longterm lowpriority project since
astronauts will have little practical use in the space program
until costs come down orders of magnitude  Furthermore using
astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation
and the sample size  So I propose LabRatSat a constellation
tetherbolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity
in superVanAllenBelt orbits that are representative of the
radiation environment encountered on EarthMoon EarthMars
Earthasteroid etc trips  The miniaturized life support
machinery might be operated realtime from earth thru a VR
interface  AFter several orbital missions have been flown
followons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface
testing out the actual environment at low cost before billions
are spent on astronauts

 By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in 
Clarke orbit  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated
robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can
practice their skills  Once in place robots can pry stuck
solar arrays and antennas attach solar battery power packs
inject fuel etc  Once the fleet is working it can be
spun off to commercial companys who can work with the comsat
companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards

By applying the successful constellation strategy and getting
rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF we
have radically improved the capability of the program while
greatly cutting its cost  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag
we can fix satellites where the satellites are we can study
life's adaptation to a much large  more representative variety 
of space environments and we can do microgravity and vacuum
research inexpensively and if needed in specialpurpose
orbits

NB we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration
as well greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality  
Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this more ambitiously 
we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used
to fuel planetwide roverballistic hopper prospecting and
sample return  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can
be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closedecology
greenhouses on Mars at low cost

They have a few problems The biggest technical problem is the need to find
two satellites going to the same rough orbit for a luanch

They also don't show much interest in commercial launches There is more
money to be made churning out Titan IV's for the government After all

Fred saying that gov coercive poser is necessary for any space program

I reply
BTW Fred you've really crossed the border since you admit that the ideas
you support can only be carried out with coercive power  Now that's really
fin' intolerant so get off yer high horse about tolerance

Fred replies
No Tommy I admit that there are such things as 'market failures'
which necessitate intervention by other than capitalist forces to
correct

I guess your understanding of this 'market failure' should be classified
under Phil's 'economics on the level of th century medicine' since you
apparently completely ignored that this 'market failure' can as easily
or even much more easily be attributed to government intervention
failure  So in addition to a strong moral argument against what you
propose there is also a strong utilitarian argument namely that gov's
destruction of wealth through confiscastory taxation and redistribution
on a major scale has made significant private capital investments harder
to make

I note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more
easily made'  Yes the argument can and has been made that current
government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were
in the first place but there is no such term as 'government failure'
since the government can change policies whenever it pleases  The
market doesn't do that and is governed by relatively wellunderstood
forces  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about
taxation etc is at bottom so much simplistic economic thinking
It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more
about economics than the libertopian  which is what invariably
happens  Tripe a la Tommy the new libertopian dish

Get a clue little boy and go salve your wounded pride in my not
considering you infallible in some other fashion  I'm not interested
in your ego games

Puhleese Fred  This besides being simply an attempt to be insulting
really belongs on private mail  If 'egogames' are so unimportatnt to
you why the insults and this strange negative attatchment for me

Wherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance

If they had beaten us I speculate that the US would have gone
head and done some landings but we also would have been more
determined to set up a base both in Earth Orbit and on the
Moon  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend
upon whether the Soviets tried to go  Setting up a lunar base
would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think
that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value
of going to Mars at least in the short run  Thus we would
have concentrated on the moon

Great speculation  I remember being proud on behalf of all the free
world you think that way when you are seven years old that we had
got there first Now I'm almost sorry that it worked out that way

I guess the soviets would have taken the victory seriously too and
would almost certainly not have fallen victim to the complacency that
overtook the US program Perhaps stretching to match US efforts would
have destabilized them sooner than it did in fact  and in the tradition
of Marvel Comics 'What If' this destabilization in the Brezhnev era might
have triggered the third world war Hmm maybe it was a giant leap after all

This system would produce enough energy to drive the accelerator
perhaps with some left over  A very high power 's of MW CW or
quasi CW very sharp proton beam would be required but this appears
achievable using a linear accelerator  The biggest question mark
would be the lead target chemistry and the online processing of all
the elements being incinerated

Paul quite frankly I'll believe that this is really going to work on
the typical trash one needs to process when I see them put a couple
tons in one end and get relatively clean material out the other end
plus be able to run it off its own residual power  Sounds almost like
perpetual motion doesn't it

Fred the honest thing to do would be to admit your criticism on
scientific grounds was invalid rather than pretend you were actually
talking about engineering feasibility  Given you postings I can't
say I am surprised though

Well pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just
tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying
to recover the energy from this process which is at least trying to
go the 'right' way on the energy curve  Now where did I put those
sackcloth and ashes

I was not and am not 'pretending' anything I am so pleased you are
not surprised though

No it is nothing like perpetual motion  

Note that I didn't say it was perpetual motion or even that it
sounded like perpetual motion the phrase was sounds almost like
perpetual motion which I at least consider a somewhat different
propposition than the one you elect to criticize  Perhaps I should
beg your pardon for being too precise in my use of language

The physics is well
understood the energy comes from fission of actinides in subcritical
assemblies  Folks have talked about spallation reactors since the
s  Pulsed spallation neutron sources are in use today as research
tools  Accelerator design has been improving particularly with
superconducting accelerating cavities which helps feasibility  Los
Alamos has expertise in high current accelerators LAMPF so I
believe they know what they are talking about

I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
technological and economic feasibility given the mixed nature of the
trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
separating things first and having a different 'run' for each
actinide when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull
relatively clean material out the other  Once the costs
technological risks etc are taken into account I still class this
one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun  Sure it's possible
and the physics are well understood but is it really a reasonable
approach 

And I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with
something like this as opposed to what kind of energy you would
really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power
with and without the energy recovery  Are we talking ounces pounds
or tons grams kilograms or metric tons for you SI fans of
material and are we talking days weeks months or years days
weeks months or years for you SI fans  hmmm still using a
nondecimated time scale I see  

The real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being
built is that there isn't any reason to do so  Natural uranium is
still too cheap and geological disposal of actinides looks
technically reasonable

	Well this pretty much says it  I have gotten alot of replys to this
and it looks like oil is only on Earth  So if those greedy little oil companys
who obviously don't give  about it uses up all the oil then that leaves us
high a dry

Greedy little oil companies  Don't blame them oil companies just supply the 
demand created by you me and just about everyone else on the planet  If we
run out its all our faults

He also ignores a few other things  While organics would become
significantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear and thus
some things would no longer be economically feasible oil is hardly
an irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables  As
supply decreases prices rise and alternatives become more
competetive  He also needs to consider that there has been an
estimated  years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has cared
about petroleum whatever the current usage rate is we always seem to
have about a  year reserve that we know about

I'm not sure that last figure is still true  we tend not to look as
hard when prices are comparatively cheap  but it was certainly true
during hte 'oil crisis' days of the 's

Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'
                                             op  april 


In het jaar  zeven jaar na de oprichting van de
Universiteit van Utrecht benoemde de universiteit haar
eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer Hiermee ontstond de tweede
universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld Aert Jansz de eerste
waarnemer en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde
in de daaropvolgende jaren decennia en eeuwen naar de
voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek Dit jaar is het 
jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond

De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten
sterrenkunde verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht
vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala
aan feestelijke activiteiten Zo is er voor scholieren een
planetenproject programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal
voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies
Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt Er
staat echter meer op stapel

Studenten natuur en sterrenkunde kunnen op  april aan een
sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen De onderwerpen van het
symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het
huidige Utrechtse onderzoek het onderzoek aan de zogeheten
'compacte objecten' de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren
Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de
deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van
de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia In de
eerste inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof Lamers een
beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren
waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een
half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten
zullen ingaan Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot
het stellen van vragen Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op
een apart vel
Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars
studenten natuur en sterrenkunde OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN
ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM

Tijdens de lezing van prof Kuijpers zullen als alles goed
gaat de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht
Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen
het heelal Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van
een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren een zogeheten pulsar
in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren
Prof Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen elkaar snel
opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling bespreken en
trachten te verklaren
Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de
technische haalbaarheid ervan De op te vangen signalen zijn
namelijk zo zwak dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 
miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 
Watt een seconde te laten branden Tijdens het symposium zal
er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden de hedendaagse
technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren

Deelname aan het symposium kost f  exclusief lunch en
f  inclusief lunch Inschrijving geschiedt door het
verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABNAMRO rekening
 tnv stichting  JUS Het gironummer van de
ABNAMRO bank Utrecht is  Bij de inschrijving dient te
worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV Na inschrijving
wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd Bij inschrijving na
 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren

Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I

        Hi Folks not exactly certain if this is the best place to ask but I am
searching for a summer internship in engineering  I will be graduating in early
 May with a BS in aerospace engineering and then pursuing my Masters this Fall
Does anyone know of anything that is available I am in the process of applyi
ng to some of the larger companies ie MacDac Martin Marietta Lockheed  If a
nyone knows of anything I would appreciate it if you could mail it to me

Thanks in advance

 I had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in
 first and second grade    They came in Chocolate
 strawberry and peanut butter and were cylinders about cm long
 and cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil well it seemed
 like space foil at the time  

Wasn't there a plain flavor too  They looked more like some
kind of extruded industrial product than food  perfectly
smooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends  Kinda scary

 The taste is hard to describe although I remember it fondly  It was
 most certainly more candy than say a modern Power Bar  Sort of
 a toffee injected with vitamins  The chocolate Power Bar is a rough
 approximation of the taste  Strawberry sucked

An other post described it as like a microwaved Tootsie Roll 
which captures the texture pretty well  As for taste they were
like candy only not very sweet  does that make sense I recall
liking them for their texture not taste I guess I have well
developed texture buds

 Man these were my 's

It was obligatory to eat a few while watching Captain Scarlet
Does anybody else remember that as long as we're off the
topic of space

Has anyone ever heard of a food product called Space Food Sticks This
was apparently createdmarketed around the time of the lunar expeditions along
with Tang and other dehydrated foods I have spoken with several people
who have eaten these before and they described them as a dehydrated candy 
Any information would be greatly appreciated 

A freeze dried Tootsie Roll tm  The actual taste sensation was like nothing
you will ever willingly experience  The amazing thing was that we ate a second
one and a third and 

I doubt that they actually flew on missions as I'm certain they did bad
things to the gastrointestinal tract  Compared to Space Food Sticks Tang was
a gastronomic contribution to mankind

A friend of mine and I were wondering where the expression pushing
the envelope comes from  Anyone out there know

Every aircraft has flight constraints for speedAOApower  When
graphed these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft
presumably so named because the graphed line encloses envelopes the
area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft
doesn't fall out of the sky  Hence 'pushing the envelope' becomes
'operating at or beyond the edge of the flight or operational
envelope' 

Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually
flies the airplane in those regions  up to that point all there are
are the theoretical predictions  Hence one of the things test pilots
do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the
correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is  in
essence 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where
the airplane actually starts to fail to fly  Note too that this is
done is a quite calculated and careful way flight tests are generally
carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how
far is precisely planned despite occasional deviations from plans
such as the 'early' first flight of the F during its highspeed
taxi tests

I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about
this process and then some

I am a bit nervous about posting this beacause it is begining to
stray fron the topic of space but then again that doesn't seem to
stop alot of other people 

With all of this talk about breathing at high pressures I began
to think about the movie Abyss If you remember in that movie one
of the characters dove to great depths by wearing a suit that used
a fluid that carries oxegen as opposed to some sort of gas Now I
have heard that mice can breath this fluid but for some reason humans
are unable to Does anyone know more details about this

Gregson Vaux


I believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump
the liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after  minutes
So if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on 
hold or else That's about it Remember a liquid is several more times
as dense as a gas by its very nature  I think depending on the gas
and liquid comparision of course

Suppose the Soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working
and had made it first  They could have beaten us if either
 Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back

 A Saturn V went boom

The Apollo fire was harsh A Saturn V explosion would have been
hurtful but The Soviets winning would have been crushing That could have
been the technological turning point for the US turning us
from Today's We can do anything we're the Super Power to a much more
reserved attitude like the Soviet Program today

Kennedy was gone by  the war was still on is the east I think
the program would have stalled badly and the goal of the moon
by  would have been dead with Nasa trying to figure were they went wrong
 
If they had beaten us I speculate that the US would have gone
head and done some landings but we also would have been more
determined to set up a base both in Earth Orbit and on the
Moon  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend
upon whether the Soviets tried to go  Setting up a lunar base
would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think
that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value
of going to Mars at least in the short run  Thus we would
have concentrated on the moon

I speulate that
The Saturn program would have been pushed into
the s with cost over runs that would just be too evil 
Nixon still wins
The Shuttle was never proposed and Skylab never built
By  the program stalled yet again under the fuel crisis
A string of small launches mark the mid seventies
By  the goal of a US man on the moon is dead and the US space program
drifts till the present day

Could you use some sort of mechanical chest compression as an aid
Sorta like the portable Iron Lung   Put some sort of flex tubing
around the 'aquanauts' chest  Cyclically compress it  and it will
push enough on the chest wall to support breathing

You'd have to trust your breather  but in space you have to trust
your suit anyway

Ocean Reconnaissance Launch Surprises West
Space News April   p
Excerpts
     Russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in  months 
March  confounding Western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead 
     The ItarTASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos  from 
Plesetsk Cosmodrome but provided little description of the payload's mission 
     However based on the satellite's trajectory Western observers 
identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic 
emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement 
     Geoff Perry of the Kettering Group in England said  Western 
observers had concluded that no more would be launched But days after the 
last such satellite reentered the Earth's atmosphere Cosmos  was 
launched 

Cosmos Satellite Launched for Defense Ministry
Moscow ITARTASS World Service in Russian   GMT  March 
Translated in FBISSOV p
by ITARTASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova
     Moscow  March  The Cosmos satellite was launched at  Moscow 
time today from the Baykonur by a TsiklonM carrier rocket An ITARTASS 
correspondent was told at the press center of Russia's spacemilitary forces 
that the satellite was launched in the interests of the Russian Defense 
Ministry 

Parameters Given
Moscow ITARTASS World Service in Russian  GMT  March 
Translated in FBISSOV p
     Moscow  March  Another artificial Earth satellite Cosmos was 
launched on  March from the Baykonur cosmodrome 
     The satellite carries scientific apparatus for continuing space research 
The satellite has been placed in an orbit with the following parameters 
initial period of revolution minutes apogee km perigee km 
orbital inclination degrees 
     Besides scientific apparatus the satellite carries a radio system for the 
precise measurement of orbital elements and a radiotelemetry system for 
transmitting to Earth data about the work of the instruments and scientific 
apparatus The apparatus aboard the satellite is working normally

What would all of you out there in net land think of the big  Martin
Mariatta Boeing Mcdonell Douglas General Dynamics Lockheed Rockwell
getting together and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market
price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles and spending say
million to do that  Recognizing that most of the military requirements
for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere say has the shuttle 
ever really used that mi crossrange capability  You get the idea figure
out how many how often where to etc

Then taking this data and forming a sematech type company bad example I
know but at least its an example  To develop between  and  craft
designs  Then to take all of those designs and figure out EXACTLY what
the technologies are and demonstrate those technologies in order to 
eliminate designs that can't be built today  And lets say that this
portion again funded by the GOV cost about  million

And from here all of these companies went their separate ways with the
intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall
street and saying I want to build this vehicle and here are the numbers
that show  ROI fund me


Now many of you think that this is a joke but I have it on good authority that
just this project is shaping up in the background It seems that the aerospace
companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things
ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled NASP NLS
ALS DCY etc  They need to work more in the japaneese and european
spirit of initial cooperation  They have also learned that design requirements
that are phony IE some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be
ends up getting chopped up in congress because it is not a REAL requirement

The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I Hugh Kelso and Bob Lilly
had with an aide of Sen Patty Murrays  We were there to discuss SSTO and
commercial space  This is how it went



After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO
I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator D Patty
Murray Washington State  I started asking for an hour and when I heard
the gasp on the end of the phone I quickly backed off to  an hour
Later in that conversation I learned that a standard appointment is  minutes

We got the standard bozo treatment  That is we were called back by an aide
who scheduled a meeting with us in order to determine that we were not
bozos and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to 
make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material

Well I got allocated  hour with Sen Murrays aide and we ended up talking
to him for  minutes with us ending the meeting and him still listening
We covered a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific  
Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer  There was another
woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that
we brought up

But with Murray being new we wanted to entrench ourselves as noncorporate
aligned IE not speaking for boeing local citizens interentested in space
So we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to
LEO  Solar power satellites are a big focus here so we hit them as becoming 
feasible with lower cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that
We hit the tourism angle and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism
paper with side notes being that everyone who goes into space and sees the
atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist esp after SEEING the smog
over LA  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification which is 
more pronounced in space and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to 
understanding of and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis  We hit the education 
whereby kids get enthused by space but as they get older and find out that
they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there they go on to other
fields with low cost to orbit the chances they might get there someday 
would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed

We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business
angle  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches gps navigation personal
communicators tellecommunications new services etc  Jobs provided
in those sectors

Jobs provided building the thing balance of trade improvement etc
We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs

We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order
to make this even easier to do  And he asked questions on this point

We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are
proceeding in this area and that we want to make sure that the
results from these efforts are not lost much like condor or majellan
and most importantly we asked that she help fund further efforts along
the lines of lowering the cost to LEO

In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data 
Purchase act and the guy filed it separately he was VERY interested in it
He asked some questions about it and seemed like he wanted to jump on it
and contact some of the people involved with it so something may actually
happen immediatly there

The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we
knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they
could feel free to call us any time with questions and if we didn't know
the answers that we would see to it that they questions got to people who
really did know the answers

Then finally we asked for an appointment with the senator herself  He
said that we would get on the list and he also said that knowing her this
would be something that she would be very interested in although they
do have a time problem getting her scheduled since she is only in the
state  week out of  these days

All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job

Composites for airframes  Look at Fly by Wire

Swept wingsif you fly in airliners you've reaped the benefits

Phil Didn't one of the early jet fighters have these  I also think
Phil the germans did some work on these in WWII

The NACA came up with them before World War II  NASA is directly
descended from the NACA with space added in

You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the
X tested at what's now Dryden had them  We did steal that one
dirctly from the Germans  The difference is that swept wings don't
change their angle of sweep sweep wings do  Perhaps the similarity
of names has caused some confusion  s have swept wings Fs
have sweep wings

Winglets  Area ruling  Digital fly by wire  Ride smoothing

Phil A lot of this was also done by the military

After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams
demonstrated them  Richard Whitcomb and RT Jones at Langley
Research Center were giants in the field

Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
ruling in the s and s respectively  It's true that we
used military aircraft as the testbeds KC and YF but
that had more to do with availability and need than with military
involvement  The YF was completely ours and the KC was
bailed to us  The Air Force of course was interested in our
results and supportive of our efforts

Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the s No
mechnaical or analog backup to show you how confident we were
General Dynamics decided to make the F flybywire when they saw how
successful we were  Mind you the Avro Arrow and the X were both
flybywire aircraft much earlier but analog

Phil Egad I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer  

The NASA habit of acquiring secondhand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing  On the other
hand all those secondhand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance
to fold the wingssomething most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base
can't do

 Does anyone have any info on the apparent sightings of Vulcan
  
 All that I know is that there were apparently two sightings at 
 drastically different times of a small planet that was inside Mercury's 
 orbit  Beyond that I have no other info

The sightings were apparently spurious  There is no planet inside of
the orbit of Mercury

The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed
perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to
Newtonian physics  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations
and calculations during the mid th century and Simon Newcombe later
improved on the observations and recalculated using Leverrier's system
of equations  Now Leverrier was one of the codiscoverers of Neptune
and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit
of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was
afoot with Mercury

But alas 'twere not so  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate
it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly
curved due to the sun's mass  This explanation had to wait until 
and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics
of moving bodies commonly called Special Relativity with Reimanian 
geometry  The result was the General Theory of Relativity and one of
it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession
of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly  Exactly if you use Newcomb's
numbers rather than Leverrier's

Of course not everybody believes Einstein and that's fine  But subsequent
efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar
have been fruitless

Paul quite frankly I'll believe that this is really going to work on
the typical trash one needs to process when I see them put a couple
tons in one end and get relatively clean material out the other end
plus be able to run it off its own residual power  Sounds almost like
perpetual motion doesn't it

I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
technological and economic feasibility given the mixed nature of the
trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
separating things first and having a different 'run' for each
actinide when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull
relatively clean material out the other  Once the costs
technological risks etc are taken into account I still class this
one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun  Sure it's possible
and the physics are well understood but is it really a reasonable
approach 


How is it ever going to be an Off the Shelf Technology if someone doesn't
do it  Maybe we should do this as part of the SSF design goals 

Gee fred  After your bitter defense of  KHz power as a Basic technology
for SSF Id think you would support a minor research program like this

And does anyone who knows more Particle physics then me  know if the IPNS
could Prove this technology


The real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being
built is that there isn't any reason to do so  Natural uranium is
still too cheap and geological disposal of actinides looks
technically reasonable


It may also help there is political gridlock on the entire
nuclear technical agenda  There were big political opponenents to
Fast Breeder Technologies  WIPP is being fought to death in Courts
Even if you could make a nuclear incinerator do you really think
even Deaf SMith County Nevada would accept it  NIMBY'ism rules
nuclear power concerns  Only the medical community has been
able to overrule  nuclear  technology opposition

I am sure  Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me
But here is how i understand it

At Speed  Near supersonic  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe
It becomes incompressible  So wind has to bend away from the
wing edges   AS the wing thickens  the more the pipes bend

If they have no place to go  they begin to stall  and force
compression stealing power from the vehicle High Drag

If you squeeze the fuselage  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend
into  then drag is reduced   

Essentially  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf
remain constant for all areas of the fuselage  That is where the wings are
subtract teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage

I think this would be a great way to build it but unfortunately
current spending rules don't permit it to be workable  For this to
work it would be necessary for the government to guarantee a certain
minimum amount of business in order to sufficiently reduce the risk
enough to make this attractive to a private firm  Since they
generally can't allocate money except one year at a time the
government can't provide such a tenant guarantee


Fred

	Try reading a bit  THe government does lots of multi year
contracts with Penalty for cancellation clauses  They just like to be
damn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year
contract   THe reason they aren't cutting defense spending as much
as they would like is the Reagan administration signed enough
Multi year contracts  that it's now cheaper to just finish them out

I don't have to try reading a bit Pat  I work as a government
contractor and know what the rules are like  Yes they sign some
damned few  which is why everyone is always having to go to
Washington to see about next week's funding multiyear contracts
they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties
when they do decide to cut the multiyear contract and not pay on it
which can happen arbitrarily at any time no matter what previous
plans were to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a
private space station with the government as the expected prime
occupant

I'd like a source for that statement about the reason they aren't
cutting defense spending as much as they would like I just don't buy
it The other thing I find a bit 'funny' about your posting Pat is
that several other people answered the question pretty much the same
way I did mine is the one you comment and incorrectly I think on
I think that says a lot  You and Tommy should move in together

NASA Headquarters distributed the following press
release today  I've typed it in verbatim for you
folks to chew over Many of the topics recently
discussed on scispace are covered in this

Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance

Dr John H Gibbons Director Office of Science and
Technology Policy outlined to the membersdesignate of
the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space
Station on April  three budget options as guidance to
the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of
the space station

A low option of  billion a midrange option of 
billion and a high option of  billion will be
considered by the committee Each option would cover
the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year  through  and would include funds for
development operations utilization Shuttle
integration facilities research operations support
transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the
available funds

Over the next  years  billion is reserved within
the NASA budget for the President's new technology
investment As a result station options above 
billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in
the rest of the NASA budget  For example a space
station option of  billion would require  billion
in offsets from the NASA budget over the next  years

Gibbons presented the information at an organizational
session of the advisory committee Generally the
membersdesignate focused upon administrative topics
and used the session to get acquainted They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation
on the process the Station Redesign Team is following
to develop options for the advisory committee to
consider

Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners  the Europeans Japanese and
Canadians  have decided after consultation to give
full consideration to use of Russian assets in the
course of the space station redesign process

To that end the Russians will be asked to participate
in the redesign effort on an asneeded consulting
basis so that the redesign team can make use of their
expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the
possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and
systems The US and international partners hope to
benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants
in assessing Russian systems and technology The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop
options for reducing station costs while preserving key
research and exploration capabilities Careful
integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in
achieving that goal

Gibbons reiterated that President Clinton is
committed to the redesigned space station and to making
every effort to preserve the science the technology
and the jobs that the space station program represents
However he also is committed to a space station that
is well managed and one that does not consume the
national resources which should be used to invest in
the future of this industry and this nation

NASA Administrator Daniel S Goldin said the Russian
participation will be accomplished through the East
West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland
under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev

Navy aircraft have folding or sweeping wings in order to save space

Now isn't that always the kicker  It does seem stupid to  drop
a mission like Magellan because there isn't   million a year
to keep up the mission  You'd think  that ongoing science  could
justify the money  JPL gets accused of spending more then neccessary
probably some validity in that  but NASA  does put money into some
things  that really are Porcine  Oh well

I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the 
operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions
were going to be funded  I don't remember his name or title off hand
and I have discarded the colloquia announcement In any case he was 
asked about that very matter Why can't we spend a few million more
to keep instruments that we already have in place going

His responce was that there are only so many  available to him and
the lead time on an instrument like a COBE Magellan Hubble etc
is  years minumum  If he spent all that could be spent on using
current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have
very little to nothing for future projects  If he did that sure
in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular
however starting a few years after he had retired he would become
one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not
funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments  Just
as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices he owed it
to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new
missions even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before
the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them

Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be
Impossible

Today  the Washington Post ran an article with the
headline shown above The article starts with A leader
of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned
space station said yesterday the job is tough and may
be impossible O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is
possible to cut costs that much and still provide for
meaningful research is a real question for me
O'Connor said everything is fair game including
dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the
aerospace industry chopping management of the space
station program at some NASA facilities around the
country working closely with the Russian space station
Mir and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the
manned space shuttle fleet

O'Connor says his team has reviewed  design options
so far and they are sorting the serious candidates
into three categories based on cost

The Post says O'Connor described the design derived
from the current SSF as a high cost option I believe
Kathy Sawyer the Post writer got confused here I
listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press
on Monday and in one part of the briefing O'Connor
talked about how the White House wants three options
sorted by cost low medium and high In another part
of the briefing he discussed the three teams he has
formed to look at three options SSF derivative  LaRC
modular buildup with Bus  MSFC and Single Launch
Core wingless Orbiter  JSC Later in response to
a reporters question I thought I heard O'Connor say
the option based on a SSF redesign was a moderate
cost option in between low  high cost options Not
the high cost option as Sawyer wrote

The article goes on to describe the other two options
as one features modules that could gradually be fitted
together in orbit similar to the Russian Mir The
other is a core facility that could be deposited in
orbit in a single launch like Skylab That option
would use existing hardware from the space shuttle 
the fuselage for example in its basic structure

The last sentence in the article contradicts the title
 the first paragraph The sentence reads He
O'Connor said a streamlined version of the planned
space station Freedom is still possible within the
administration's budget guidelines

If the japanese are really going for Nukes why not go with better
technology then we have  AS opposed to BWRPWRs  have they really
considered some of the rd generation Inherently safe designs

The Japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes
This means that unlike the Germans who do great things all by themselves
the Japanese tie up with foreign companies The major one is Mitsubishi
who else who have a sharing agreement with GE I think No chance of a
new design

Sodium has lots of chemical problems but it really solves design
difficulties  Or the inherently safe types

Sodium has lots of chemical problems Like it eats stainless steel Very
slowly but it gets there in the end Not what I call a desired property
As for design difficulties what does sodium do there It is a bitch and
it is only its chemical properties flwed though they are that means it
gets used Two loops That's not a design problem Isolation from air and
water That doesn't cause design problems In comparison BWR's a dream rides

PWR's work real good  but they need lots of steel  and they are highly
complex systems  Simplicity is a virtue

Don't get none of that in a Liquid Sodium Breeder More steel more complexity

It isn't feasible for Japan to try to stockpile the amount of oil they
would need to run their industries if they did no use nuclear power

Of course  Given they export   of the GNP  What do they do

Well they don't export anywhere near  of their GNP Mexico's perhaps
but not their own They actually export around the  mark Similar
to most developed countries actually Australia exports a larger share
of GNP as does the United States  I think off hand Always likely to
be out by a factor of  or more though This would be immediately obvious
if you thought about it

Anything serious enough to disrupt the sea lanes for oil will
also hose their export routes

It is their import routes that count They can do without exports but
they couldn't live without imports for any longer than six months if that

Given they import everything  oil is just one more critical commodity

Too true But one that is unstable and hence a source of serious worry

   was wisely spent and maybe it wasn't but the work done
   with it should stand on its own merits not distorting
   the cost of other projects Congress has no idea of the
   existense of these wraps Congress has never heard the
   term 'center tax' They look at the Station they are
   getting and the price they are paying and note that
   it doesn't add up They wonder this blissfully unaware
   that a third of the money is going for something else

My dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here A couple
of weeks ago when I first read this in your posting I
talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station
at Headquarters if you wondering why I didn't post a
response immediately I do have a real job I'm supposed
to be doing here at Headquarters  digging up old  kHz
data  looking into SherzerKyger claims rates pretty low
on the totem pole of priority Also I spent last weekend
in Kansas City at the National Science Teachers 
Association conference extolling the virtues of SSF
to  science teachers

First off yes the concept of 'center tax' or 'wrap' does
exist If I recall the numbers correctly the total 'tax'
for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around  Million
This was computed by adding up the WP WP and WP
center 'taxes' With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at
 Billion my calculater says the tax percentage is
  

Over the life of the SSF program using your figure of 
billion for the cost of SSF a tax at a  rate comes to
 million This is alot less than  billion but I
will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket
change

I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at  could
be close to the actual rate The tax is only charged on funds
that are spent at the center kind of like McDonalds at some
states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat
the food at the restaurant but you don't if you get it
takeout For example at WP the vast bulk of the funds
we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract and are NOT
subject to the center tax I don't have the numbers in
front of me but I'd guess at least  of the WP funds
go to Rocketdyne So you could be right about a tax
rate of  but it's only applied to funds spent at the
center and not to the prime contracts

This leads to the obvious question What is the government
doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors
ie ok WP gets a slice of the  billion pie A
big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne What happens
to the balance of the funds which aren't eaten
up by the center tax

At WP we call these funds we spend inhouse supporting
development funds as they are supporting the development
work done by Rocketdyne We have used these funds to
setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical
power system architecture Our testbed has a real life
solar array field left over from solar cell research
research a few years back with leadacid car batteries
to simulate the NickelHydrogen batteries on SSF DC
switchgear DCDC converter units and simulated
loads Data from the testbed was used in a recent
change evaluation involving concerns about the stability
of the power system

We have also used the supporting development money to
purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries which are on life
testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in
Indiana As a side point  of the battery cells on
test recently hit the four year life test milestone
 cells have completed  to  cycles the
onorbit batteries go through  cycles per year

As a final example my 'home' division at Lewis used
the supporting development funds to purchase personal
computers and work stations for performing system
analyses like modeling of the performance of the
electrical power system availability calculations
using a MonteCarlo simulation setting up a 
database with information on weight of the power
system elements

Finally the money raised by the 'tax' does not all
go into a 'slush fund' At Lewis the director
does control a small discretionary fund Each year
any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to
the director to get money from this fund to look
at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter

Most of the tax however goes to fund the 'general'
services at the Center like the library the 
central computer services division the Contractor 
who removes the snow etc Thus it is rather
difficult to determine what percentage of the
SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities To get
an accurate figure you would have to take
the annual expenditure for the library for example
and then divide by the amount of the library funds
used to support SSF which would be hard to
compute by itself  how would you figure out
what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for
 year is 'billable' to SSF would you base it on
the personhours SSF employees spend reading AVweek
versus the rest of the center personnel You would
then have to compare this estimate of the SSF
portion of the library expense with the portion of
the tax that goes to support the library Who knows
maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library but
we underpay for snow removal Talk about
a burecratic nightmare

My last point is that I can't believe your claim that
Congress has never heard of the term 'center tax'
Unfortunately all of the NASA testimony before
Congress isn't on a computer so I can't do a simple
word search someplace to prove you wrong But surely
in some GAO audit somewhere these NASA cost methods
were documented for Congress

McDonnell Douglas rolls out DCX

        HUNTINGTON BEACH Calif  On a pictureperfect Southern
California day McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DCX rocket ship last
Saturday  The company hopes this singlestage rocket technology
demonstrator will be the first step towards a singlestagetoorbit SSTO
rocket ship

        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico this week  Flight tests will start in
midJune

        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for
SSTO research remains cloudy  The SDI Organization  which paid 
million for the DCX  can't itself afford to fund full development of a
followon vehicle  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for
a suborbital DCXA SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government
agencies

        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for
orbital deployments of spacebased sensors and weapns  However recent
changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO
less of a priority  Today the agency is more interested in using DCX as
a step towards a lowcost reusable sounding rocket

        SDIO has already done  briefings to other government agencies
said Col  Simon Pete Worden SDIO's deputy for technology  But Worden
declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the
program I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I
have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell
Douglas Astronautics headquarters

        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital
objective agency officials hail the DCX as an example of the better
faster cheaper approach to hardware development  The agency believes
this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of
evolutionary technology developments

        Worden said the DCX illustrates how a build a little test a
little approach can produce results on time and within budget  He said
the program  which went from concept to hardware in around  months 
showed how today's engineers could move beyond the miracles of our
parents' time

        The key is management Worden said SDIO had a very light hand
on this project  We had only one overworked major Jess Sponable

        Although the next phase may involve more agencies Worden said
lean management and a sense of governmentindustry partnership will be
crucial It's essential we do not end up with a large management
structure where the price goes up exponentially

        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the
House Science Space and Technology Committee This is the direction
we're going to have to go said Rep  George Brown the committee's
Democratic chairman Programs that stretch aout  to  years aren't
sustainableNASA hasn't learned it yet  SDIO has

        Rep  Dana Rohrbacher Brown's Republican colleague went further
Joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team
Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it
were left to the civil space agency

        Rohrbacher whose Orange County district includes McDonnell
Douglas also criticized NASAAir Force work on conventional multistaged
rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology Let's not
build fancy ammunition with capsules on top  Let's build a spaceship

         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship he said the
private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology

        McDonnell Douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its
C transport and Space Station Freedom programs were more cautious
about a large private secotro commitment On very large ventures
companies put in seed money said Charles Ordahl McDonnell Douglas'
senior vice president for space systems You need strong government
investments

        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding
for the DCXA they agree on continuing an incremental approach to
development  Citing corporate history they liken the process to Douglas
Aircraft's DC aircraft  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for
the DC transport a gradual evolution in singlestage rocketry could
eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper DC

        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will expand the envelope
of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude  The
first tests will reach  feet and demonstrate hovering verticle
takeoff and landing  The second series will send the unmanned DCX up to
 feet  The third and final series will take the craft up to 
feet

        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase  The final
tests will include a pitchover manever that rotates the vehicle back
into a bottomdown configuration for a soft fourlegged landing

        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles Pete
Conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo  moon landing
Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president Conrad paised the vehicles
aircraftlike approach to operations  Features include automated
checkout and access panels for easy maintainance

        If the program moves to the next stage engine technology will
become a key consideration  This engine would have more thrust than the
Pratt  Whitney RLA engines used on the DCX  Each motor uses liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to  pounds of
thrust

        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages the A model
has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and threetoon
throttling capability  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid
turnaround

        Worden said future singlestage rockets could employ
tripropellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union
The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and
then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes

        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place  Pratt has
a technology agreement with NPO Energomash the design bureau responsible
for the tripropellant and Energia cryogenic engines

On the issue of 'burning' nuclear wastes using particle beams

How is it ever going to be an Off the Shelf Technology if someone doesn't
do it  Maybe we should do this as part of the SSF design goals 

Gee fred  After your bitter defense of  KHz power as a Basic technology
for SSF Id think you would support a minor research program like
this

I sometimes wonder if your newsfeed gives you different articles than
everyone else Pat  Just a few corrections

 I never 'defended' kHz power other than as something reasonable
to GO LOOK AT

 I have also never opposed a research project into feasibility of
the spalling reactor approach to 'cleaning' nuclear waste  I simply
doubt it could be made to work in the Real World tm which ought to
become clear fairly quickly during a research program into feasibility
sort of like what happened to  kHz power  it proved to have a
downside that was too expensive to overcome

I figure  things wrong in a single sentence is a high enough fault
density for even you Pat

 flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what 
 is going to be  'pushed' and how
 far is precisely planned despite occasional deviations from plans
 such as the 'early' first flight of the F during its highspeed
 taxi tests

 and Chuck Yeager earlier flights with the X

  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCE

NASA Headquarters Washington DC
April  

RELEASE  

        Dr  John H  Gibbons Director Office of Science and Technology
Policy outlined to the membersdesignate of the Advisory Committee on the
Redesign of the Space Station on April  three budget options as guidance
to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space
station

        A low option of  billion a midrange option of  billion and a
high option of  billion will be considered by the committee  Each
option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year  through  and would include funds for development
operations utilization Shuttle integration facilities research
operations support transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds

        Over the next  years  billion is reserved within the NASA
budget for the President's new technology investment  As a result
station options above  billion must be accompanied by offsetting
reductions in the rest of the NASA budget  For example a space station
option of  billion would require  billion in offsets from the NASA
budget over the next  years

        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of
the advisory committee  Generally the membersdesignate focused upon
administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted  They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the
Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory
committee to consider

        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners  the Europeans Japanese and Canadians  have
decided after consultation to give full consideration to use of
Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process

        To that end the Russians will be asked to participate in the
redesign effort on an asneeded consulting basis so that the redesign
team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR
and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems
The US and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of
the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology  The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing
station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes
Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving
that goal

        Gibbons reiterated that President Clinton is committed to the
redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the
science the technology and the jobs that the space station program
represents  However he also is committed to a space station that is well
managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should
be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation

        NASA Administrator Daniel S  Goldin said the Russian
participation will be accomplished through the EastWest Space Science
Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald
Sagdeev

 and had a big radar in the nose and  AAMs in closed bays on the
 underside of the fuselage  The description even then read speeds
 in excess of Mach  at altitudes exceeding  feet

 Of course the units of force have the same names as those of weight
 but in order to use them you need to keep useful constants like the
 omnipresent  ftsec around
 
 Maybe you'd like to go over again how this system is so natural and
 so easy to use Gary While you're at it you can figure out for us
 the weight of  barrels and a quart of foo density lb   oz per
 cubic foot on the moon gravity  ft   insec Let's face it
 even the imperial system uses a basically metric way of relating
 quantities ie that would be written as  ftsec the only
 thing you're hanging on to is the right to express the same quantity
 as  inches  feet  yards or  chains What
 everyone else is saying is why do you want to do that
 
 Any apparent remaining complexity in the SI system is due to the
 multiplicity of the aforesaid prefixes In fact what's going on and
 the fundamental difference between SI and imperial is that you have
 exactly one unit of each type and all values of that type are
 expressed as some multiple of the unit

You mean like seconds minutes hours days months years    

Remember  the Fahrenheit temperature scale is also a centigrade scale  Some
revisionists tell the history something like this  The coldest point in a
particular Russian winter was marked on the thermometer as was the body
temperature of a volunteer turns out he was sick but you can't win 'em all
Then the space in between the marks on the thermometer was then divided into
hundredths

Nick sez
I'm not very impressed by the old socalled prospecting work from
LPI it has almost all been geared towards industrially silly processes on
the moon as an excuse to put astronauts there   

Fred replies
Translation  It doesn't support the Nick Szabo Vision of the Future
to Which You MUST Subscribe

Tom sez
Fred we're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done to some
degree  If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done
address it instead of just complaining about his doing so

Fred again
You really don't get what the 'complaints' are about do you
  not incredibly clear explanation of complaintssomething between
   feelings regarding Nick's method and judgments about his meaning

T
Maybe I'd get it if you said what the complaints are about rather than
doing the same things that you mean to complain about  When you trash
people how am I supposed to read that as 'trashing people is bad'

F
Gee funny that you get it now then  Deliberate obtuseness perhaps

 Fred's issue   Nick's alleged trashing of others 

I only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently
instead of 'allegorically'  That was my point all along Fred

Not only
do you do the same thing on the net honestly reporting your ideas
on matters of policy and projects in space but your response was just
baiting not even part of a debate

I have yet to see Nick enter into anything remotely resembling a
debate  I see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with The
One True Szabo Plan I see him attacking people calling them lazy
bastard because they had the temerity to disagree with the Almight
Nick I see him questioning peoples ethics again because they had the
temerity to disagree with Lord God Szabo  But debate  BWAAaaahhhaaaa

I'm glad you can laugh since your ratio of debateinsult is about the same

Not even close Tommy and generally only when I'm dealing with
someone like Nick

I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations not
least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is
and is not debate  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last
point  Why don't you take a poll Fred if you want some psuedoobjective
pointofview

And as usual you defend your insults with he started it  Yeah I
took some of his research and called it my own but he started it  So
what if I stole his car he stole my lawnmower first  Besides that I
think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it
So your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of
the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway

Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool  I
never borrowed it I already gave it back and it was broken when you
gave it to me  Make up yer mind Fred

I'm not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space
based process and your response doesn't tell me a thing about the
reasons why you think they should be except to impune the motives of
the person with a divergent opinion

Who said I think they should be Tommy  Show me a note where I said
that and I'll eat this terminal    See below Fred

Fred I cocluded that you did since you took issue with it  The fact
that my conclusion was incorrect ie that you were taking issue with
something different is evidence that your communication style is
confusing

Or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate

First I try to address what I think you meant for which I am rewarded
with a denial of sorts and a smart remark  Then I point out that I am
not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly
interpreting you a second time and I'm stupid for it  I just can't win
can I Fred  You've got a great point here somewhere it's just that
between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of
your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it

Please quote the 'it' I took issue with  I believe you will see if
you look that what I was and am taking issue with is Mr Szabo's idea
that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his
toasterbased infrastructure is finished  All Hail the Szabo Plan

 Fred issue   Nick's alleged meaning 

Too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of Nick's or you
would have a really good point  Instead you have provided a good reason
to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations
that you have made about others  Forgive me for giving your insults more
meaning than they ever should have had

My reading of what Nick actually said is that people aren't required in
all parts of all space processes so your taking issue with his opinions
regarding people in the space program I read as People are required in
all parts of all space processes  So help me out here Fred since I'm
so patently stupid  Did you read Nick wrong  Or are you going to eat
your terminal now  If the latter I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and
string models that all the computer mags have been raving about 

The point is I am not stupid because of your incorrect assumption  I'd
only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it  But alas that's your
job Fred

And finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points
simultaneously with an allegoryinsult  Sadly one point addressed a 'plan'
that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that
you do as much as anyone

More deliberate lack of understanding Tommy

No no I finally got it  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made
you imagine  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior even though
it's no worse than your own  Thanks for taking the time with someone as
dense as myself

If you have a problem with Nick's delivery address that  The way you
bait you're perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of

No Tommy the 'bait' is that which elicits the response  NICK
'baits' I just flame him for being an obnoxious fool

I don't really care who started it  I read this list to get information
and other's views on the issues to which it was dedicated not to be
your Mom He started it  No he did or to hear about why Nick is a very
bad guy  If you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to
the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time

That's nice Tommy  When you pay me to post to the net you can
complain about not getting your money's worth  Perhaps if you weren't
deliberately too thick to get the point the first time I wouldn't
have to waste time explaining myself all the time

Of course Socrates  How could it be otherwise

I think it's neat how all this criticism from you started after your
'fatherly' admonitions to me about how such things should be handled
outside Usenet were somewhat rebuffed  Being a little hypocritical
Tommy to go with the immaturity  Or is this just the pique of a
netghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he thought was new
and hence could be 'instructed'  Tommy I saw you come on the net

Who cares who came on the net first  If you do consider that you saw
me come on after a brief haitus before which I was on for about  years
If you had seen me on the net first you'd remember when Nick and I went
down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior  It's
just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's
no worse than your own

Let's see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical
while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't and my
complaints about your namecalling are immature while your namecalling
isn't  Yeah right  Maybe if you called me some more names I might
see it better Fred

Netghod wannabe  Naturally Fred you've correctly interpreted my
motivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions as
your insulting of people that try proves  I didn't really care about
people that fill the net with personal garbage what I really wanted was to
impress everyone  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private
mail not because it belongs there but because I thought you were such a
jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net playing right into my hands
Alas I had no idea what an intellectual master you were turning tables and
bringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuable
purpose of embarassing me  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried
to make suggestions to such a superior intellect or becuase I tried to
communicate like an adult with a selfrighteous ass still isn't clear

Well Fred you exposed me  Now I'll never be able to get another job
with NASA since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall  Well
I just hope you're happy  Please leave me alone now  I just don't
have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me  Maybe Nick
or Pat can approach your high standards but I'm dropping it now

   McDonnell Douglas rolls out DCX

 


   SSTO research remains cloudy  The SDI Organization  which paid 
   million for the DCX  can't itself afford to fund full development of a
   followon vehicle  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for

This is a little peculiar way of putting it SDIO's budget this year
was what  billion They could fund all of the DC development
out of one years budget  of course they do have other irons in the
fire  and launcher development is not their primary purpose but
the DC development could as easily be paid for by diverting that money
as by diverting the comparable STS ops budget

 oh and before the flames start I applaud the SDIO for funding DCX
devlopment and I hope it works and no launcher development is not
NASAs primary goal either IMHO they are supposed to provide the
enabling technology research for others to do launcher development
and secondarily operate such launchers as they require  but that's
just me

 Another legend with the name Vulcan was the planet much like Earth
 in the same orbit

There was a Science fiction movie sometime ago I do not remember its 
name about a planet in the same orbit of Earth but hidden behind the 
Sun so it could never be visible from Earth Turns out that that planet 
was the exact mirror image of Earth and all its inhabitants looked like 
the Earthings with the difference that their organs was in the opposite 
side like the heart was in the right side instead in the left and they 
would shake hands with the left hand and so on

Here are some recent observations taken by the Hubble Space Telescope

     o The Faint Object Spectrograph FOS was used to make ultraviolet
       observations of both the planet Pluto and its moon Charon The
       peakups were successful The observations were executed as
       scheduled and no problems were reported

     o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet
       Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus These
       observations will help in our understanding of the planet's
       atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes This event occurred
       close to the last quarter moon and special arrangements had to be
       made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations
       The observations are currently being reviewed and all the
       observations looked okay

 	Quick  Everyone who sees this post a reply that says
 
 			Hey I read scispace
 
 Then we can count them and find out how many there are 
 This will also help answer that nagging question Just what is
 the maximum bandwidth of the Internet anyways

A practical suggestion to be sure but one could also peek into
newslists where Brian Reid has posted USENET Readership report for
Mar  Another posting called USENET READERSHIP SUMMARY REPORT FOR
MAR  gives the methodology and caveats of Reid's survey  These
postings failed to appear for a while I wonder why but they are
now back

Reid alas gives us no measure of the powerinfluence of readers
Sorry Mark

I suspect Mark dangling out there on Fidonet may not get newslists
so I've mailed him copies of these reports

  While you're at it comet experts explain how a comet gets into

  There are nongravitational forces from heating and outgassing when a
  comet gets into the inner solar system  
 
 Don't forget the Galilean satellites of Jupiter  
 
 My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny
 masses sitting very close to Jupiter play any role whatsoever in the
 problem   Or to put it more technically the extra volume they add
 to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible
 
 Jupiter is E kg while the Galilean satellites are around E
 
 Also as I said the few references that I've looked at do not
 mention outgassing or breakup as important processes  The important
 thing is a JupiterSuncomet reverse slingshot that leads to a
 weakly Jupiterbound orbit for the comet at least a temporary one

I really thought that by now I would have seen something
about this but I haven't so here goes  Last night on
the evening news the anchorperson said something to the
effect that one of the SSRBs that was recovered after the
recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of
some sort rattling around apparently inside the case  There
was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was
found of what type of wrench it was but the anchorperson
did say something about a NASA official commenting that
there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB

Has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be 
better than mine heard anything about this  It seems rather
weird

                         April    

SPACECRAFT

  On April  realtime commands were sent as planned to reacquire
celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna LGA
swingDual Drive Actuator DDA hammer activities

  On April  the EJ EarthJupiter  sequence memory load was uplinked
to the spacecraft without incident  This sequence covers spacecraft activity
from April   to June   and includes a window for the Radio Relay
Antenna RRA slew test on April    The command loss timer was set to
 days as a part of this sequence memory load

  On April  and  a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss
timer to  hours its planned value during this mission phase

  On April  cruise science Memory Readouts MROs were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV Dust Detector DDS and Magnetometer
MAG instruments  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly

  On April  an UltraStable Oscillator USO test was performed to verify
the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
data long term trend analysis is continuing

  On April  a bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
optimal SignaltoNoise Ratio SNR when transmitting at bps  Preliminary
analysis of the data suggests that the present prelaunch selected modulation
index is near the optimal level

  On April  cruise science Memory Readouts MROs were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV and Magnetometer MAG instrument
Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly

  On April  a periodic RPM RetroPropulsion Module Newton thruster
flushing maintenance activity was performed all  thrusters were flushed
during the activity  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal

  The ACDC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
changes greater than  DN throughout this period  The AC measurement reads
 DN  volts  The DC measurement reads  DN  volts  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ACDC special
anomaly team

 The Spacecraft status as of April   is as follows

       a  System Power Margin    watts
       b  Spin Configuration  DualSpin
       c  Spin RateSensor  rpmStar Scanner
       d  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately  degrees

GDS Ground Data Systems

  Galileo participated in a second DSN Deep Space Network acceptance test
for the DSN Telemetry Phase  Upgrade on April   using CTA
Compatibility Test Area   The purpose of this test was to verify
the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller
TGC and the Telemetry Channel Assembly TCA  The TGCTCA is the replacement
for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly TPA  Seven different telemetry
rates were run for this test all ran well on both the MTS MCCC Telemetry
Subsystem and the AMMOS MGDS V GIF with the exception of bps  The
bps rate had some trouble staying in lock it appears the TGCTCA was
not metering the data correctly  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS
data from this test are being conducted MVT Mission Verification Test of
the TGCTCA system is expected to begin May  


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday April   the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows

	Distance from Earth          km  AU
	Distance from Sun            km  AU
	Heliocentric Speed           km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter        km
	Round Trip Light Time        minutes  seconds


SPECIAL TOPIC

  As of April   a total of  realtime commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch  Of these   were initiated in the
sequence design process and  initiated in the realtime command process
In the past week  real time commands were transmitted  were initiated in
the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process
Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference
uplink the EJ sequence memory load and reset the command loss timer

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April  


     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the
successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to
measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer

     The April  flight from California's BarstowDaggett Airport
reached an altitude of  kilometers  feet and took
measurements as part of a program established to correlate data
with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite UARS  

     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to
readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy
ATMOS experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle
Discovery

     We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an
ongoing ozone research program  In fact JPL is actively
involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three
important ways said Dr Jim Margitan principal investigator on
the balloon research campaign  

     There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite he
continued  The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists
and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth
for those activities as well as data that is useful in its own
right

     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more
pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere specifically the
midlatitude stratosphere during winter and spring 
Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps
scientists construct more accurate computer models which are
instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions

     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL
instruments  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures
ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere
a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave
radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere and a Fourier
transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the
atmosphere absorbs sunlight 

     Launch occurred at about noontime and following a three
hour ascent the balloon floated eastward at approximately 
kilometers per hour  knots  Data was radioed to ground
stations and recorded onboard  The flight ended at  pm
Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded
to separate from the balloon

     We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared
measurements Margitan explained and we also needed to fly in
darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear

     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the
completed results of their experiments  They will then forward
their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland for use by the UARS
scientists    

     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon
Facility normally based in Palestine Tex operating under a
contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility  The balloon was
launched in California because of the westtoeast wind direction
and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest

     The balloons are made of micron  mil or less than
onethousandth of an inch thick plastic and are  cubic
meters  million cubic feet in volume when fully inflated with
helium  meters  feet in diameter  The balloons weigh
between  and  kilograms  and  pounds  The
scientific payload weighs about  kilograms  pounds
and is  meters six feet square by  meters  feet high

     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper
Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements
Program

I know people hate it when someone says somethings like there was an article 
about that somewhere a while ago but I'm going to say it anyway  I read an
article on this subject almost certainly in Space News and something like
six months ago  If anyone is really interested in the subject I can probably
hunt it down given enough motivation

 There was a Science fiction movie sometime ago I do not remember its 
 name about a planet in the same orbit of Earth but hidden behind the 
 Sun so it could never be visible from Earth 

This was known as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun in the United
States and as Doppelganger in the UK  It was produced by the great
team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson whose science was usually a bit
better than this  It may have been their first production using live
actors they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows
such as Supercar Stingray and Thunderbirds  Later they went
on to do more liveaction SF series UFO and Space 

The astronomy was lousy but the liftingbody spacecraft VTOL
airliners and mighty Portugese launch complex were wonderful to
look at

  So how close would the comet have gotten to Jupiter on the pass that
  put it into temporary orbit and how far is it likely to get from
  Jupiter before it makes its escape
 
 The answer to all of these questions is we don't know yet
 We don't know for sure if the comet is in a temporary orbit
 
I see  I wasn't so interested in this particular case as in typical
behavior anyway  Can these questions be answered for a previous
instance such as the Gehrels  that was mentioned in an earlier posting
 
 Gehrels  was in a temporary Jovian orbit for about  or  years  I'll
 get the orbital elements from Dance of the Planets and post them here

Sorry folks I should have done this and meant to just after i hit the 
send key

This question is probably mostly for Allen Sherzer but anyone who KNOWS
would be welcome to answer  I was just wondering if we could have some kind
of update on DCX

Well it rolled out two weeks ago As we speak it is at White Sands getting
ready I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out
of town in NM

As for the future there is at least M in next years budget for work
on SSRT They SDIO have been looking for more funds and do seem to have
some However SDIO is not I repeat is not going to fund an orbital
prototype The best we can hope from them is to  keep it alive for
another year and  fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT with
major modifications just make orbit There is also some money for a
set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions

Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort The USAF managers of
this program are very open to SSTO and will have about M next
year for studies This would be enough to bring DCY to PDR

Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made
for spending half on DC

Public support is STILL critical Meet with your Congressperson I'll
help you do it and get hisher support Also call your local media
ans get them to cover the flight tests

   On April  the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National 
Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System LPS co
inventor and vicepresident of the LPS Coalition Dr Robert D
Waldron  It will be held at  pm at the Rockwell Science
Center in Thousand Oaks CA

   Dr Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space
Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell
International in Downey California  He is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement  He has written or
coauthored more than  articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization  Along with Dr David
Criswell Waldron invented the lunarsolar power system concept

   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs legal
experts and Soviet and US scientists and engineers to build
the Lunar Power System a pollutionfree energy source with a
potential to power the globe

   For the past three years members of the coalition nearly half
from California have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the Moon

   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae  A mature LPS offers an enormous
source of clean sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever
increasing demand using proven basic technology

be  Sorry if this is a really dumb question but


In pure speculation I would guess cautions based on hazardous

It does raise an interesting question as to how hard it is to

Can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation 

He was sitting atop a rocket awaiting liftoff and afterwards in answer to
the question what he had been thinking about said approximately half a
million components each has to work perfectly each supplied by the lowest
bidder 

Attribution and correction of the quote would be much appreciated

Don't you think it would be better to Email back to you that we read scispace
so that you can count them and every server in the world does not have to get

Well first you work out how much cold gas you need then make the
tanks big enough

Working out how much cold gas is another problem depending on
vehicle configuration flight duration thruster Isp which couples
into storage pressure which may be a factor in selecting tank
wall thickness etc

Programmatically yes we can land an Orbiter with a  cm hole in
the wall  provided that the thing which caused  cm hole didn't
cause a Crit  failure on some of the internal systems  There are
a few places where a  cm hole would cause a Bad Day  especially
if the  cm hole went all the way through the Orbiter and out the

hole in the pressure vessel would cause us to immediately deorbit

The situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years
See the discussion of highpower rocketry in the recmodelsrockets
frequentlyaskedquestions list

This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy you need
proper certification  That can be had mostly through Tripoli the high
power analog of the NAR although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend
the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too

You need special FAA authorization but provided you aren't doing it under
one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that it's not
especially hard to arrange

As with model rocketry this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled
properly  Proper handling takes more care and you need a lot more empty
air to fly in but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up  As with
model rocketry the highpower people use factorybuilt engines which
eliminates the major safety hazard of doityourself rocketry

and an INSTALLEXE to set them up painlessly  No charge for
the scispace feed though you have to dial Washington DC
This is NOT a BBS  it's a store  forward system for mail

calls  This is not an offer for a free feed for any other
particular newsgroups  Speeds of up to  vbis are
supported  VIP's might be offered other free services such
as Internet address and other functionality

I get my feed from UUNET and run a line hub  I've been
hubbing for years  I have an extremely reliable hub

Paul mine'll do  feet and carries  pounds of dynamite Dokas

Could it be Public Missile Inc in Michigan

From the description of ad here it sounds like they're talking about
High Power Rocketry an outgrowth of model rocketry  This hobby
uses nonmetallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured
engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P  The hobby
has been flourishing from early s and is becoming increasing popular
Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry

Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than  pounds OR using a
total impulse of G or greater REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch
Typically a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period
of time ie week weekend etc at a designated site and time and
all of the launches are then covered under this blanket waiver
There is also a High Power Safety Code which designates more
specific rules such as launch field size etc

Finally in order to purchase any of the larger Class B rocket 
motors you need to certified through either the National Association
of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association Certification procedures
require a demonstarted handling and safe flight at a total impulse
level

Let's see These aren't in a strict sense amateur rockets That term
denotes rockets the engines of which are constructed by the user The
rockets you describe are called HPR or high power rockets to
distinguish them from smaller model rockets They use factorymade
ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines
with graphite nozzles The engines are classified by impulse A D
engine for example can have no more than  newtonseconds of impulse
An F engine can have no more than  ns Each letter corresponds to a
doubling of the maximum impulse So far engines up to size O are
available pretty much off the shelf Engines of size H and above are
shipped as Class B explosives and as such are controlled Engines of
size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives and are not as
controlled Class F engines BTW are not HPR engines but model rocket
engines Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo

There is an HPR Society The Tripoli Rocket Society I believe which
holds events at various sites throughout the year with all legalities
FAA waiver included taken care of The National Association of
Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H though it is involved
in HPR as well These societies certify users of HPR rockets and
companies will not sell to uncertified individuals

Bottom Line It's legit I suggest you send for a catalog  but forget
the dynamite will ya

     LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY LA
  ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD

   On April  the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National 
Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System LPS co
inventor and vicepresident of the LPS Coalition Dr Robert D
Waldron  It will be held at  pm at the Rockwell Science
Center in Thousand Oaks CA

   Dr Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space
Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell
International in Downey California  He is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement  He has written or
coauthored more than  articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization  Along with Dr David
Criswell Waldron invented the lunarsolar power system concept

   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs legal
experts and Soviet and US scientists and engineers to build
the Lunar Power System a pollutionfree energy source with a
potential to power the globe

   For the past three years members of the coalition nearly half
from California have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the Moon

   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae  A mature LPS offers an enormous
source of clean sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever
increasing demand using proven basic technology

Actually they are legal I not familiar with the ad you are speaking of
but knowing Popular Science it is probably on the fringe  However you
may be speaking of Public Missle Inc which is a legitimate company
that has been around for a while

Due to advances in composite fuels engines are now available for model
rockets using similar composites to SRB fuel roughly  times more 
powerful than black powder motors  They are even available in a reloadable
form ie aluminum casing end casings orings   The engines range
from D all the way to M in common manufacture N and O I've heard of
used at special occasions

To be a model rocket however the rocket can't contain any metal 
structural parts amongst other requirements  I've never heard of a
model rocket doing   I have heard of   foot flights
These require FAA waivers of course  There are a few large national
launches LDRS FireBALLS at which you can see many  K sized engine
flights  Actually using a  G engine constitutes the area of High
Power Rocketry which is seperate from normal model rocketry  Purchase
of engines like I have been describing require membership in the National
Association of Rocketry the Tripoli Rocketry Assoc or you have to
be part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry

Amatuer rocketry is another area  I'm not really familiar with this
but it is an area where metal parts are allowed along with liquid fuels
and what not  I don't know what kind of regulations are involved but
I'm sure they are numerous

High power rocketry is very exciting  If you are interested or have 
more questions there is a newsgroup recmodelrockets

As for the future there is at least M in next years budget for work
on SSRT They SDIO have been looking for more funds and do seem to have
some However SDIO is not I repeat is not going to fund an orbital
prototype The best we can hope from them is to  keep it alive for
another year and  fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT with
major modifications just make orbit There is also some money for a
set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions

Would the suborbital version be suitable asis or aswillbe for use
as a reuseable sounding rocket


Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort The USAF managers of
this program are very open to SSTO and will have about M next
year for studies This would be enough to bring DCY to PDR

Thank Ghod I had thought that Spacelifter would definitely be the
bastard Son of NLS


And just as a reminder
Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made
for spending half on DC

Public support is STILL critical Meet with your Congressperson I'll
help you do it and get hisher support Also call your local media
and get them to cover the flight tests

  NOW WHERE DID I LEAVE THOSE PLIERS
    When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS
 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers
 lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB  The tool survived
 the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a  foot
 altitude then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC

    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media

    It's been a long time since something like this happened  We've
 lost washers and bolts before but never a tool like this

    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a
 Thiokol Corp technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on
 April nd  Unfortunately the worker's supervisor did not act on the
 report and Discovery was launched with its extra payload  NASA
 officials were never told of the missing tool before the April th
 launch date

    The freeflying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB
 technician  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster
 its inch long rope was still attached  The pliers were found in a
 part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad
Ron's ed note  naaahhh  just too easy

    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that
 the Shuttle processor will take appropriate action  Thiokol is a
 subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch

effect that one of the SSRBs that was recovered after the
recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of
some sort rattling around apparently inside the case
I heard a similar statement in our local news UTAH tonight They referred
to the tool as the PLIERS that took a ride into space They also
said that a Thiokol sp employee had reported missing a tool of some kind
during assembly of one SRB

It was a test of the first reusable tool


I assume then that someone at Thiokol put on their manager's hat and said
that pissing off the customer by delaying shipment of the SRB to look inside
it was a bad idea regardless of where that tool might have ended up

Why do I get the feeling that Thiokol manager's hats are shaped like cones

Pointy so they can find them or so they will stick into their pants better and
be closer to their brains

The Japanese spacecraft Hiten crashed on the Moon last weekend  For the

aerobraking experiments with Earth's atmosphere  It was placed in lunar
orbit in February  and I guess it finally ran out of fuel and was
unable to maintain its orbit around the Moon

Reported yesterday in the Washington Post Kathy Sawyer writer

The article plays down the Russian role in US space

Gibbons science advisor to Clinton sent Goldin a letter indicating
NASA should not limit redesign options to those compatible with Mir
orbit

The White House thinks expectations for Russian cooperation have been
raised too high

The article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits
for space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly
impossible  That's why some think Goldin has begun looking at 
Russian hardware

Goldin states NASA will present all options to the administration 
which will then have decision making power

Goldin and the White House have totally ruled out using Energia to
boost the station

A short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention
about how the Japanese using what sounded like a gravity assist had just
managed to crash or crashland a package on the moon

Their Hiten engineeringtest mission spent a while in a highly eccentric
Earth orbit doing lunar flybys and then was inserted into lunar orbit
using some very tricky gravityassistlike maneuvering  This meant that
it would crash on the Moon eventually since there is no such thing as
a stable lunar orbit as far as anyone knows and I believe I recall
hearing recently that it was about to happen


The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'  These
are described by the inventor as exploiting the secondorder perturbations in a
three body system  The probe was launched into this region for the
earthmoonsun system where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without
expending fuel we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible The
originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested but that Japan
was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for
deceleration

believe about  months ago

  Background The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept  It
would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft
The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to
ten megatons yield behind a pusher plate attached to the main
spacecraft  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer
momentum to the ship

  Now in an atmosphere I can see this  The energy of the explosion
heats the atmosphere which expands explosively and slams a shock wave
into the pusher plate  But in a vacuum only two things I can see are
going to hit the plate fissionfusion products barium krypton
helium neutrons evaporated bomb casing and electromagnetic
radiation gammas mostly some lightheat from irradiated fission
products

  Would this work  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much
momentum especially given the mass of the pusher plate and it seems
to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs
out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once
they're there

  I must be missing something  Would someone enlighten me via email

  Thanks

Actually Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all
so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand  The lunarorbit mission was
an afterthought after Hagoromo a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten
during a lunar flyby had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion
into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed

It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages  It takes
a long time and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit
If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit you do have
to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel although it is reduced from
what you'd need for the bruteforce approach

The Orion concept as actually proposed as opposed to the way it has been
somewhat misrepresented in some fiction included wrapping a thick layer
of reaction mass  probably plastic of some sort  around each bomb
The bomb vaporizes the reaction mass and it's that which transfers
momentum to the pusher plate

 there is no such thing as a stable lunar orbit

Is it right That is new stuff for me So it means that  you just can 
not put a sattellite around around the Moon for too long because its 
orbit will be unstable If so what is the reason Is that because 
the combined gravitacional atraction of the SunMoon and Earth 
that does not provide a stable  orbit around the Moon

I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to
Moscow last week  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation
Institute who have asked me to post this announcement  I have done
some editing but the contents is unchanged from the original
announcement 

For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute it is
the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training
of aircraft and spacecraft designers  It specializes in airframe
design powerplant design control systems and power systems
Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers Tupolev
Su Iluchine Migoyan etc were schooled at MAI

I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at
MAI  The aircraft include Mig Su  Yak  the cockpit of an
F among others  It was a fascinating and eye opening
experience expecially given the fact that the museum was until a year
or so ago closed to virtually everyone  I also had the opportunity to
see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines
for future space craft use

If you have any questions about the Institute or the program I would
be glad to try and answer them  The institute and most of it's faculty
have email addresses  However it takes about a day or so for the
receiver to get the message  They are still a bit antiquated  but they
are rapidly changing

rlsuihepahepuiucedu Ray Swartz Oh that guy again writes

The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'  These
are described by the inventor as exploiting the secondorder perturbations in a
three body system  The probe was launched into this region for the
earthmoonsun system where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without
expending fuel we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible The
originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested but that Japan
was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for
deceleration


I should probably repost this with another title so that
the guys on the other thread would see that this is a practical
use of temporary orbits

Another possible temporary orbit

 there is no such thing as a stable lunar orbit

Is it right That is new stuff for me So it means that  you just can 
not put a sattellite around around the Moon for too long because its 
orbit will be unstable If so what is the reason Is that because 
the combined gravitacional atraction of the SunMoon and Earth 
that does not provide a stable  orbit around the Moon

Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections and when
its fuel runs out it will crash within months  The orbits of the Apollo
motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few
days  It is possible that there are stable orbits here and there 
the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped  but we know of none

Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at low
altitudes  The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational field
is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon

In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid
rockets as payloads  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on
a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations  Solid
motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of 
aluminum in the mix  For example the Space Shuttle SRBs are  percent
Aluminum  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure
The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles an I suspect
some bubbling process is used to form it  In other words if you made
a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum then froze it this is what
you get  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in
all directions  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into
the voids and you get aluminumreinforced solid propellant  The
foamedaluminum makes up about  percent of the total propellant
so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain  The major
improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking which is the
principal failure mode for solid propellant

Okay lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun  
The project manager is Dr John Hunter and he works for the
Laser group at Livermore  What you may ask does gas guns
have to do with lasers Nothing really but the gun is physically
located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building
and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room thick walls
from which the gun firings are controlled  So I suspect that the
office he works for is an administrative convenience

I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb and we toured the gun
At the time I was working on gas gun RD at Boeing where I work
but I am now doing other things helping to save the space station

The gun uses a methaneair mixture which is burned in a chamber
about  ft long by  inch ID ie it looks like a pipe
The chamber holds a  ton piston which is propelled at several
hundred ms down the chamber  On the other side of the piston
is hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome tens
of atmospheres

The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until
a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures at around  psi
The barrel of the gun is about  feet long and has a  inch
bore  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber ie they
intersect  This was done so that in the future the barrel
could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to
move the larger and heavier chamber  The projectile being used
in testing is a  kg cylinder of Lexan plastic  in in diameter
and about  cm long

All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen
gas from  psi downwards until the projectile leaves the
barrel  The barrel is evacuated and the end is sealed with a
sheet of plastic film a little thicker than Saran wrap  The
plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped
in the barrel ahead of the projectile  

The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic
water jugs  In the early testing fragments of the plastic
projectile were found  At the higher speeds in later testing
the projectile vaporizes

The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is
about  miles across and the projectile would go  km
if fired for maximum range  The intent is to move the whole gun
to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete where they can
fire into the Pacific Ocean and use the tracking radar at VAFB
to follow the projectiles

The design goal of the gun is to throw a  kg projectile at 
kms half of orbital speed  So far they have reached  kms
and the gun is currently down for repairs as on the last test
they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware I think it
had to do with the methaneair more detonating than burning but
I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this

There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this
gun by firing then out of the gun into the air at Mach 
 kms since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 

This gun cost about  million to develop and is basically
a proofofconcept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful
sized payloads into space  This would require on the order of
 kg projectiles which deliver on the order of  kg
useful payload to orbit

Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet their
ERL resin with T carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive
strength of  psi  It has a density of  lbcu in
therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column
that can just support itself is  million inches or  ft
or  Statute miles

Now a real structure will have horizontal bracing either a truss
type or guy wires or both and will be used below the crush strength
Let us assume that we will operate at  of the theoretical 
strength  This gives a working height of  miles for a constant
section column  

A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can
build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section
as you go up  For example let us say you have a  pound
load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in
calculation  This requires  square inches of column cross
sectional area to support the weight  The mile of structure
below the payload will itself weigh  lb so at  mile 
below the payload the total load is now  lb a  increase

The next mile of structure must be  thicker in cross section
to support the top mile of tower plus the payload  Each mile
of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way
to the bottom  We can see from this that there is no theoretical
limit on area although there will be practical limits based
on how much composites we can afford to by at lb and how
much load you need to support on the ground for which you need
a foundation that the bedrock can support

Let us arbitrarily choose  billion as the limit in costruction
cost  With this we can afford perhaps  lb of composites
assuming our finished structure costs lb  The lb figure
is just for materials cost  Then we have a towerpayload mass
ratio of   At a  mass ratio per mile the tower
height becomes  miles  This is clearly above the significant
atmosphere  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still
have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and glosses
will be almost eliminated  Glosses are the component of
rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity
but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity  Thus
they represent wasted thrust  Together with drag rockets starting
from the ground have a  velocity penalty to contend with

This analysis is simplified in that it does not consider wind
loads  These will require more structural support over the first
 miles of height  Above that the air pressure drops to a low
enough value for it not to be a big factor

There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's
LA Times Thursday April   p D  I thought I'd post it to
stir up some flame wars  I mean reasoned debate  Let me preface it by
saying that I largely agree that the Space Age in the romantic sense
of several decades ago is over and that projects like the space station
miss the point at this time  Reading for example What's New 
the weekly physics update we get here on the net  it's clear that the
romance of the day lies in the ever more finegrained manipulation of
matter by which I include biotechnology condensed matter physics with
its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere and the amazing things
people are doing with individual atoms these days  To a large extent I
think the romance some people still have with space is a matter of
nostalgia  I feel sure that someday we  or more precisely our mind
children  will spread across space unless we wipe ourselves out but
I think that manned space exploration is not what is exciting about
what we can do now   

Anyway let me quote some of this article but not all


SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW

Micheal Schrage writer consultant and research associate at MIT

At  America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a
midlife crisis

The reason is that the Space Age is already dead  The technologies no
longer define our times and the public has grown weary of the multibillion
dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic
rewards  

Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science
and technology debate into a peripheral issue  Speace is not a
meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate our
technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion
policy  

To be sure America should continue to invest in satellite technologies
for telecommunications and remote sensing  cheap deepspace probes
would be nice too  but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of
scientific and industrial innovation is now dead



Before the change in administrations it would have been foolish to
write an obituary for the Space Age  The Bush White House aggressively
supported the space program and proposed spending well over  billion
to build space station Freedom alone

Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains
Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken
public champion of bigticket space expenditures  The reality that much
of the civilian space program  from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope
to the space station  was poorly conceived and unimpressively
implemented did not seem to matter much

Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism  not a coherent
vision or costeffective sensibilities  determined multibilliondollar
space budgets

Indeed with few notable exceptions such as Voyager the postApollo
era is the story of the goldplated porkification of space exploration
with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more  



While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel
Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration it seems clear that space exploration is not being
positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's
technological prowess  The space station budget has  rightly  been
slashed  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions
its competitiveness agenda



I wish this had happened  years ago instead of starting to happen
now says Bruce Murray a Caltech professor who ran NASA's Jet
Propulsion Lab in Pasadena  We've put off a lot of things we shouldn't
have I would rather see a billion NASA doing well than a
billion one filled with white elephants

The difficulties of a high Isp OTV include
Long transfer times radiation damage from VanAllen belts for both
 the spacecraft and OTV
Arcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have
to have either nuclear power source messy dangerous and source of
radiation damage or BIG solar arrays sensitive to radiation or heavy
that make attitude control and docking a big pain

If you go solar you have to replace the arrays every trip with
current technology Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted
by international treaty

Refueling even for very high Isp like xenon is still required and
turn out to be a pain

You either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation
to do docking or     and refueling 

You still can't do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high

The Air Force continues to look at doing things this way though I suppose
they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and
the problems get solved  Not impossible in principle but hard to
do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets at least today

Just a few random thoughts on high Isp OTV's I designed one once

We are not at the end of the Space Age but only at the end of Its
beginning

That space exploration is no longer a driver for technical innovation
or a focus of American cultural attention is certainly debatable however
technical developments in other quarters will always be examined for
possible applications in the space area and we can look forward to
many innovations that might enhance the capabilities and lower the
cost of future space operations

This is turning into 'what's a moonbase good for' and I ought
not to post when I've a hundred some odd posts to go but I would
think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic

Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much
larger GNP than they would without space industry eventually
they will simply be able to afford more stuff

 Is anybody out there willing to discuss with me careers in the Army that deal
 with space  After I graduate I will have a commitment to serve in the Army
 and I would like to spend it in a spacerelated field  I saw a post a long
 time ago about the Air Force Space Command which made a fleeting reference to
 its Army counterpart  Any more info on that would be appreciated  I'm 
 looking for things like do I branch Intelligence or Signal or other  To
 whom do I voice my interest in space  What qualifications are necessary
 Etc etc  BTW my major is computer science engineering

Kerry I'm guessing a little at this because it's been a few years 
since I saw the info but you will probably want to look at Air Defense 
Artillery as a specialty or possibly Signals  The kind of thing you're 
looking for is SDItype assignments but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff
Things like hardkill ATBM missiles some of the COBRA rigs  that kind 
of thing  

Hope that gives you some ideas on where to look though

BTW universities do the same thing They however have a wrap of
 to  again this is over and above any overhead charge
 
Wrong Allen The max overhead charge is ALL of the charge There is no
seperately budgeted overhead in any shape size form or fashion 
 
A professor at the University of Virginia told me their wrap was about
 The subcontracts I have let out and worked on for other universities
are about the same My employer a nonprofit research institute does
the same This is generally reffered to as the fee
 

I don't care who told you this it is not generally true I see EVERY single
line item on a contract and I have to sign it There is no such thing as
wrap at this university I also asked around here Ther is no wrap at 
Marquette University of Wisconsin Madison Utah State Weber State or
Embry Riddle U I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance
that I have been able to track down it does not Also the president of our
University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did
not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead
to be a legitimate charge

How do 
I know I write proposals and have won contracts and I know to the dime
what the charges are At UAH for example the overhead is 
 
Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate Go ask your
costing people how much fee they add to a project


I did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that
any percentage number like this is included in the overhead

If you have some numbers Allen then show them else quit barking 
 
I did Dennis read the article To repeat an internal estimate done by
the Reston costing department says Freedom can be built for about B
a year and operated for B per year IF all the money where spent on
Freedom Since we spend about half a billion  more per year it looks
like roughly  of the money is wasted Now if you think I'm making
this up you can confirm it in the anonymous editorial published a few
weeks ago in Space News


No Allen you did not You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee
of the Overhead capital of NASA Nothing that Reston does could not be dont
better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on
Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is
at a place where everything is overhead

This Dennis is why NASA has so many problems you can't accept that
anything is wrong unless you can blame it on Congress Oh sure you'll
say NASA has problems but do you believe it Remember the WP 
overrun You insisted it was all congresses fault when NASA management
knew about the overrun for almost a year yet refused to act Do you
still blame Congress for the overrun


Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally
demanded change that caused the problems Methinks that you are being 
selective with the facts again

By your own numbers Allen at a cost of  million per flight the
service cost of flying shuttle to SSF is  billion for four flights so how
did you get your one billion number
 
I have no idea what your trying to say here Dennis
 
  Allen
 

If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost
of  million a flight then you pay  billion a year You stated that your
friend at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it
for a billion a year if the wrap were gone This merely points out a 
blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see

Dennis University of Alabama in Huntsville

Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going
to have to do Allen's math for him for a while I will have little chance to
do so

Oddly enough  The smithsonian calls the lindbergh years
the golden age of flight  I would call it the granite years
reflecting the primitive nature of it  It was  romantic
swashbuckling daredevils  those daring young men in their flying
machines  But in reality it sucked  Death was a highly likely
occurence  and  the environment blew  Ever see the early navy
pressure suits  they were modified  diving suits  You were ready to
star in plan  from outer space   Radios  and Nav AIds were
a joke  and engines ran on castor oil  They  picked and called aviators
men with iron stomachs  and it wasn't due to vertigo

Oddly enough now we are in the golden age of flight  I can hop the
shuttle to NY for  bucks  now that's golden

Mercury gemini and apollo were romantic  but let's be honest
Peeing in bags  having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime
you needed a bowel movement  Living for days inside a VW Bug
Romantic  but not commercial   The DCX  points out a most likely
new golden age  An age where  fat cigar smoking business men in
loud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls
and used space ship lots

hhhmmmmm  maybe i'll  retract that golden age bit   Maybe it was
better in the old days  Of course then we'll have  wally schirra
telling his great grand children In my day  we walked on the moon
Every day  Miles  no buses  you kids got it soft

For an essay I am writing about the space shuttle and a need for a better
propulsion system  Through research I have found that it is rather clumsy 
ie all the checkstests before launch the safety hazards sitting
on a hydrogen bomb etc  If you have any beefs about the current
space shuttle program Re propulsion please send me your ideas

Thanks a lot

I don't care who told you this it is not generally true I see EVERY single
line item on a contract and I have to sign it There is no such thing as
wrap at this university 

Dennis I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions
of  Customers included government including NASA for profit and
nonprofit companies All expected a wrap usually called a fee Much
of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors
The subcontractors where universities forprofits nonprofits and
even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space ALL
charged fees as part of the work Down the street is one of the NASA
commercialization centers they charge a fee

Now I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis but you clearly lack
experience in several areas Your posts show that you don't understand
the importance of integration in large projects You also show a lack
of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it
is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything This isn't
a flame jsut a statement

Your employer DOES charge a fee You may not see it but you do

Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate Go ask your
costing people how much fee they add to a project

I did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that
any percentage number like this is included in the overhead

Well there you are Dennis As I said they simply include the fee in
their overhead Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can
change depending on the customer

No Allen you did not You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee
of the Overhead capital of NASA 

Integration Dennis isn't overhead

Nothing that Reston does could not be dont
better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on

Dennis Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs When
WP  was hemoraging out a billion  the centers you love so much where
doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem Reston was the
only place you would find people actually interested in solving the
problems and building a station

Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is
at a place where everything is overhead

When you have a bit more experience Dennis you will realize that
integration isn't overhead It is the single most important part
of a successful large scale effort

Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally
demanded change that caused the problems Methinks that you are being 
selective with the facts again

The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on
Congress Suprise suprise The fact remains that it is the centers
you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address
the problems until the press published the story

Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address
the overruns You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns

If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost

for a billion a year if the wrap were gone This merely points out a 
blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see

You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for
resuply That comes from the Shuttle budget What they where saying
is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport

Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going
to have to do Allen's math for him for a while I will have little chance to
do so

I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of
Reston to ask that the problems with WP  be addressed

Please go just one step further
How has the word Clementine been associated with mining
  
Old pioneer song from the 's or so goes as follows
  
  In a cavern in a canyon
   Excavating for a mine
   Dwelt a miner fortyniner
   And his daughter CLEMENTINE
  
Chorus
  Oh my darling Oh my darling
   Oh my darling Clementine
   You are lost and gone forever
   Oh my darling Clementine
  
 I've also had it explained but not confirmed from a reliable data
source that CLEMENTINE is an acronym  Something like Combined
Lunar Elemental Mapper Experiment on Extended Non Terrestrial
Intercept Near Earth  Personally I think that acronym was made up
to fit the name if it really is an acronym

To All  I thought the net would find this amusing
  
From the March  Aero Vision The newsletter for the Employees
of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach California
  
  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY
  
  On Monday March  at noon Quest Aerospace Education Inc
  launched two DCY Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria
  The first rocket was launched by Dr Bill Gaubatz director and
  SSTO program manager and the second by Air Force Captain Ed
  Spalding who with Staff Sgt Don Gisburne represents Air Force
  Space Command which was requested by SDIO to assess the DCX for
  potential military operational use  Both rocket launches were
  successful  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria
  and Building  and the second landed on the roof of the
  cafeteria
  
  Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the
  McDonnell Douglas DCX  The nd semiscale model of the
  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude
  of  feet  The Space Clippers can be used in educational
  settings to teach mathematics and science as well as social
  studies and other applications  The Space Clipper is available
  either in the  Space Clipper outfit which includes everything
  needed for three launches or as individual rockets for  each
  Both are available through hobby shops or by calling

  I might suggest giving the management some more mumble time by asking
the very leading question in two or three parts
   What are your long term expectations of space market what projects
specifically are they funding by internal funds and at what levels
and what competition do you expect in this  area This last point
is always worth hitting upper management with gently if you want 
them to think and as hard as you can if you have a good case that
there really is competion

This is turning into 'what's a moonbase good for' and I ought
not to post when I've a hundred some odd posts to go but I would
think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic

Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much
larger GNP than they would without space industry eventually
they will simply be able to afford more stuff

If I read you right you're saying in essence that with a larger
economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste
on a lunar facility That was certainly partially the case with Apollo 
but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military
scientific or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have 
the money why not approach

It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose it's possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose but it's most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least Therefore Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases Can you
put a  person base on the Moon for  million a year Even if you
use grad students

they are going to launch they say sorry but I forget
exactly who is saying what OTC to PLT I think
Clear caution  warning memory  Verify no unexpected
errors   I am wondering what an expected error might
be  Sorry if this is a really dumb question but


In pure speculation I would guess cautions based on hazardous
prelaunch ops would qualify  Something like Caution  SRBs
have just been armed  

Also in pure speculation

Parity errors in memory or previously known conditions that were waivered
   Yes that is an error but we already knew about it

Any problem where they decided a backup would handle it

Any problem in an area that was not criticality  that is any
   problem in a system they decided they could do without

I'd be curious as to what the real meaning of the quote is

 This was known as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun in the United
 States and as Doppelganger in the UK Later they went
 on to do more liveaction SF series UFO and Space 
 
 The astronomy was lousy but the liftingbody spacecraft VTOL
 airliners and mighty Portugese launch complex were wonderful to
 look at

Exactly Some of the SPACE effects remain firstrate even today 
 
 They recycled a lot of models and theme music for UFO  Some of the
 concepts even showed up in SPACE  
 

Later on the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some
of the worst pseudoscientific shows in TV history by flying Into Infinity
This was a oneoff thing done as part of BBC's educational SF series The
Day After Tomorrow The Anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of
reaching the speed of light lightship Altares the fourman crew eventually 
journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy I
think I saw this as a yearold back in  and liked it very much but
then again I was a fan of SPACE so I guess I was easily satisfied in those
days

Does anyone know if Into Infinity has been released on video I have some
SPACE shows on VHS and know that Thunderbirds etc also are available in
England

                              by Eddie McCreary

Introduction

The Image Machine is a Windows based image processing package for use with
the CDROMs distributed by the NSSDC containing data from Voyager and other
spacecraft  It it intended mainly for use with these disks and should not
be considered a general imaging application  Future versions will correct
this

Features include

               Read compressed images directly from disk  No preprocessing
                required

               Basic image processing functions such as low and high pass
                filtering zoom rotate flip and much much more

               Complete customizable filter kernels  Write your own
                filters if you don't like those provided with program

               Reseau mark removal  Get rid of unsightly reseau marks
                with the click of a button

               It's Freeware  Give it to your best friend give it to
                your motherinlaw give it to your dog I just don't care

Media

The Image Machine has been tested with the following CDROMs

               Voyagers to the Outer Planets Vol   

               Mission To Mars Viking Orbiter Images of Mars Vol    

               Mars Mosaicked Digital Image Model Vol   

               Mission To Jupiter Galileo Images of Venus Earth  Moon
                Vol   

               Magellan MIDR CDROMs tested with only select images

It should be compatible with most images stored in PDS and VICAR format
but unless the image belongs to one of the above sets it hasn't been
tested

Requirements

               SX processor or above MHz preferred

                MB RAM the more the better

               Microsoft Window 

Availability

The Image Machine can be found on amesarcnasagov under pubSPACESOFTWARE
as imachzip  I've also submitted it to compbinariesmswindows so
if you don't have ftp access wait a few days and it should appear at your
site

Disclaimer

The Image Machine is a private project written by myself in my spare time
I am in no way associated with the National Space Science Data Center
or NASA and this project should not be consider endorsed by them

 The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'  These
 are described by the inventor as exploiting the secondorder perturbations in a
 three body system  The probe was launched into this region for the
 earthmoonsun system where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
 allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
 down The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without
 expending fuel we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible The
 originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested but that Japan
 was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for
 deceleration

My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically
known bugs in the warning system software  things are checked
that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't
set till after launch and suchlike Rather than fix the code
and possibly introduce new bugs they just tell the crew
'ok if you see a warning no  before liftoff ignore it'

The SDIO has contracted with the NRL Naval Research Laboratory to fly the Clementine Mission  BTW we call it DSPSE Deep Space Project Science Experiment

The NRL is building the spacecraft designing the detailed mission and doing the
integration and operations with help from JPL  Goddard  prob some folks I
have left outdon't be mad

I am on the TAMP Trajectory Analysis  Mission Planning team and am responsable
for the IVV of the traj that GoddardCSC are designing

As for why SDIO is doing it some of the reasons are

     the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO

     in LEO we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors we will get
       that data on our  passages through the Van Allen sp Belts

     since we are going out therewhy not piggyback some general science

     the intercept problem is a lot easied over LONG distances and LONG times

I am sure there are some things I have forgotten and some I haven't been told
but those are the reasons we all talk about

  Can these questions be answered for a previous

Thanks for the information

I assume p is the semimajor axis and e the eccentricity  The peri
helion and aphelion are then given by pe and pe ie about
 and  AU respectively  For Jupiter they are  and  AU
If  was after the temporary capture this means that the comet
ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than  AU to Jupiter's 
which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could
get under Jupiter's influence

 Also perihelions of Gehrels were
 
 April        jupiter radii
 August       jupiter radii

Where  Jupiter radius   km   mi   AU  So the
 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove
Is that the case for the  figure as well

It states that the latest satellite was placed in Orbit Plane Position C
There is already one satellite in that position I know that it's almost
ten years since that satellite was launched but it's still in operation so
why not use it until it goes off

Why not instead place the new satellite at B since that position is empty

             The Lunar Teleoperation Model One LTM
             
                        By David H Mitchell
                          March  
 
INTRODUCTION
 
In order to increase public interest in spacebased and lunar operations a
real miniature lunarlike environment is being constructed on which to test
teleoperated models These models are remotelycontrolled by individuals
located worldwide using their personal computers for EduTainment
purposes
Not only does this provide a testbed for simple teleoperation and
telepresence activities but it also provides for the sharing of
information
on methods of operating in space including but not limited to layout of
a
lunar colony teleoperating machines for work and play disseminating
educational information providing contests and awards for creativity and
achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in
TwentyFirst century remote learning methods
 
Because of the nature of the LTM project people of all ages interests
and
skills can contribute scenery and murals models and structures
interfacing
and electronics software and graphics In operation LTM is an evolving
playground and laboratory that can be used by children students and
professionals worldwide Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at
a participating institution a user is able to teleoperate real models at
the
LTM base for experimental or recreational purposes Because a real
facility
exists ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the
construction
of the lunar model its operation and new features to be added as suggested
by the users themselves
 
This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups
  teleoperations and virtual reality research
  radio control model railroad and ham radio operation
  astronomy and space planetariums and science centers
  art and theater
  bbs and online network users
  software and game developers
  manufacturers and retailers of model rockets cars and trains
  children
  the child in all of us
 
LTM OVERALL DESIGN
 
A room  feet by  feet contains the base lunar layout The walls are used
for murals of distant moon mountains star fields and a view of the earth
The floor is the simulated lunar surface A global call for contributions
is hereby made for material for the lunar surface and for the design and
creation of scale models of lunar colony elements scenery and
machinelets
 
 The LTM initial design has  teleoperated machinelets
  An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land
  A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and
  A moontrain which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface
 
 Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on
 it A personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture
 content and doing datacompression to allow for minimal images to be sent
 to the operator for control purposes and also return control signals
 
The first machinelet to be set up will be the moontrain since model trains
with TV cameras built in are almost offtheshelf items and control
electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal The user will
receive an image once every  to  seconds depending on the speed of their
data link to LTM
 
Next an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a
servomotor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the
SSTO
to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar
landscape and land
 
Finally some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped
bulldozerlets The entire initial LTM will allow remote operators
worldwide
to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and
takeoff traveling and doing work The entire system is based on
commercially
available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the
interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced
ham radio operator and computer hardwaresoftware developers
 
By taking a graphically oriented communications program Dmodem and adding
a teleoperations screen and controls the necessary user interface can be
provided in under  man hours
 
PLAN OF ACTION
 
The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by
providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network
Diaspar is providing the  foot by  foot facility for actual construction
of the lunar model Diaspar has in stock the electronic tanks that can be
modified and one CCD TV chip Diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock
for the lunar train model Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical
communications package and modify it for control of the machineslets
An initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for
a live photosession and news conference on April   The initial
models will be put in place A timelapse record will be started for
historical purposes It is not expected that this event will be completely
serious or solemn The lunar colony will be declared open for additional
building operations and experiments A photographer will be present and
the photographs taken will be converted to gif images for distribution
worldwide to major online networks and bbs's A press release will be
issued
calling for contributions of ideas time talent materials and scale
models
for the simulated lunar colony
 
A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then
be
announced Universities will be invited to participate the goal being to
find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of
the lunar colony model Field trips to LTM can be arranged and at that
time
the results of the class work will be added to the model Contributors will
then be able to teleoperate any contributed machinelets once they return
to
their campus
 
A monthly LTM newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via
conventional means to the media Any major new teleoperated equipment
addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media
Having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo
opportunity for the television community Especially since the action
will
be controlled by people all over the world Science fiction writers will be
invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at
universities to build and operate the teleoperated equipment to perform
lunar tasks Using counterweight and pulley systems  gravity may be
simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges
 
The long term goal is creating worldwide interest education
experimentation
and remote operation of a lunar colony LTM has the potential of being a
long
term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic
example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited
to space EduTainment All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can
lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars
 
CONCLUSION
 
EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment Anyone who has
ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a
globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation
purposes By creating a teleoperated model lunar colony we not only create
worldwide publicity but also a method of trying new ideas that require
real
not virtual skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in
space

 I feel sure
that someone must have film of that experiment and I'd really like to
see it Has anyone out there seen it

I've seen a film of it my memory may be faulty but as I
remember it the vehicle was slightly over a meter long with a
thick baseplate  cm in diameter I think the narrative said
it was propelled by dynamite sticks There were four detonations
within about  s the second coming after about  m of flight in
Max altitude seemed to be on the order of  m but that is hard 
to judge

The biggest problem with this is that all orbits are not alike  It can
actually be more expensive to reach a satellite from another orbit than
from the ground  

But with cheaper fuel from space based sources it will be cheaper to 
reach more orbits than from the ground

Also remember that the presence of a repairsupply facility adds value
to the space around it If you can put your satellite in an orbit where it
can be reached by a ready source of supply you can make it cheaper and gain
benefit from economies of scale

In article APRjudyuhedu wingocsparadecnetFedexMsfcNasaGov writes
 
I don't care who told you this it is not generally true I see EVERY single
line item on a contract and I have to sign it There is no such thing as
wrap at this university 
 
Dennis I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions
of  Customers included government including NASA for profit and
nonprofit companies All expected a wrap usually called a fee Much
of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors
The subcontractors where universities forprofits nonprofits and
even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space ALL
charged fees as part of the work Down the street is one of the NASA
commercialization centers they charge a fee
 

You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen In that post
you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead
Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true

Now I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis but you clearly lack
experience in several areas Your posts show that you don't understand
the importance of integration in large projects You also show a lack
of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it
is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything This isn't
a flame jsut a statement

Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing
what and who is working on integration This is simply an ad hominum
attack and you know it

 
Your employer DOES charge a fee You may not see it but you do


Of course there is a fee It is for administration Geez Allen any
organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate
costs such as libraries and other things that must be there to support
a program and wrap as you originally stated itYou stated that wrap
was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you
say is not true Which is it Allen

Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate Go ask your
costing people how much fee they add to a project
 
I did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that
any percentage number like this is included in the overhead
 
Well there you are Dennis As I said they simply include the fee in
their overhead Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can
change depending on the customer


As you have posted on this subject Allen you state that wrap is over and
above overhead and is a seperate charge You admit here that this is wrong
Nasa has a line item budget every year I have seen it Allen Get some
numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then
howl to high heaven about it Until you do that you are barking in the wind

No Allen you did not You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee
of the Overhead capital of NASA 
 
Integration Dennis isn't overhead
 
Nothing that Reston does could not be dont
better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on


Integration could be done better at the centers Apollo integration was 
done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad The philosophy of
Reston is totally wrong Allen There you have a bunch of people who are
completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee There
is no way that will ever work It has never worked in any large scale project
that it was ever tried on Could you imagine a Reston like set up for 
Apollo

Dennis Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs When
WP  was hemoraging out a billion  the centers you love so much where
doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem Reston was the
only place you would find people actually interested in solving the
problems and building a station


Oh you are full of it Allen on this one I agree that JSC screwed up big
They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it
replaced To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your
bias goes Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just
how wrong you really are Maybe not people like you believe exactly what
they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it 

Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is
at a place where everything is overhead
 
When you have a bit more experience Dennis you will realize that
integration isn't overhead It is the single most important part
of a successful large scale effort


I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful
large scale effort What I completly disagree with is seperating that
integration function from  the people that are doing the work It is called
leadership Allen That is what made Apollo work Final responsibility for
the success of Apollo was held by less than  people That is leadership
and responsibility There is neither when you have any organization set up
as Reston is You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC
and they could do a much better job Why did it take a year for Reston to
finally say something about the problem If they were on site and part of the
process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place

There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen but one thing I do know is that
for a project to be successful you must have leadership I remember all of the
turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you It is
lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem Lack of
leadership from the White House Congress and at Reston Nasa is only a
symptom of a greater national problem You are so narrowly focused in your
efforts that you do not see this

Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally
demanded change that caused the problems Methinks that you are being 
selective with the facts again
 
The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on
Congress Suprise suprise The fact remains that it is the centers
you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address
the problems until the press published the story
 
Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address
the overruns You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns


No I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have 
happened in the first place

If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost
of  million a flight then you pay  billion a year You stated that your
friend at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it
for a billion a year if the wrap were gone This merely points out a 
blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see
 
You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for
resuply That comes from the Shuttle budget What they where saying
is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport
 
Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going
to have to do Allen's math for him for a while I will have little chance to
do so
 
I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of
Reston to ask that the problems with WP  be addressed
 
I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is
at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened totally
ignoring the lack of leadership of congress This many headed hydra that
has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to 
change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of
your position

   This is turning into 'what's a moonbase good for' and I ought not
   to post when I've a hundred some odd posts to go but I would
   think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic
   
   Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much
   larger GNP than they would without space industry eventually
   they will simply be able to afford more stuff

   If I read you right you're saying in essence that with a larger
   economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a
   lunar facility That was certainly partially the case with Apollo
   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing
   military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than
   just a we have the money why not approach

Ah but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not
wasted on the moon It's not like they'd be using  R bills
to fuel their moondozers The money to fund a lunar base would be
spent in the country to which the base belonged It's a way of funding
hightech research just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various
fields of research under the pretense that it was crucial to the
defense of the country or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to
fund research under the pretense that it's good for panEuropean
cooperation

Now maybe you think that governmentfunded research is a waste of
money in fact I'm pretty sure you do but it does count as
investment spending which does boost the economy and just look at
the size of that multiplier

   My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically
   known bugs in the warning system software  things are checked
   that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't
   set till after launch and suchlike Rather than fix the code
   and possibly introduce new bugs they just tell the crew
   'ok if you see a warning no  before liftoff ignore it'

Good grief And I thought the Shuttle software was known for being
wellengineered If this is actually the case every member of the
programming team should be taken out and shot

given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level  in
maturity I strongly doubt that this is the case

  The Magellan mission at Venus continues normally gathering gravity
data which provides measurement of density variations in the upper
mantle which can be correlated to surface topography  Spacecraft
performance is nominal

  Magellan has completed  orbits of Venus and is now  days from
the end of Cycle and the start of the Transition Experiment

  No significant activities are expected next week as preparations
for aerobraking continue on schedule

  On Monday morning April  the moon will occult Venus and

 I'm an advocate of this idea for funding Space Station work and I
 throw around the  billion figure for that reward  I suggest that
 you increase the Lunar reward to about  billion
 
 This would encourage private industry to invest in space which 
 should be one of NASA's primary goals

Imagine a radio station that advertises Mercedes Benzes diamond

   Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks
   for sounding rockets

   Well first you work out how much cold gas you need then make the
   tanks big enough

Our sounding rocket payload with telemetry guidance etc etc and a
telescope cluster weighs around  pounds  It uses freon jets for
steering and a pulsewidthmodulated controller for alignment ie
during our eight minutes in space the jets are pretty much
continuously firing on a  duty cycle or so  The jets also
need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization and
flip the payload around to look at the Sun

We have two freon tanks each holding  liters of freon I'm speaking
only from memory of the last flight  The ground crew at WSMR choose how
much freon to use based on some blackmagic algorithm  They have
extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack

This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas 
quantity  If you really need to know send me email and I'll try to get you
in touch with our ground crew people

Cheers
Craig

And with B on offer the problem of keeping them alive is highly
likely to involve more than just the lunar environment 

Oh Dear my freighter just landed on the roof of ACME's base and they
all died  How sad  Gosh that leaves us as the oldest residents

I'm kidding BTW although the problem of winnertakesall prizes is
that it encourages all sorts of undesirable behaviour  witness
military procurement programs  And b is probably far too small a
reward to encourage what would be a very expensive and high risk

Every time you read about a shuttle landing they mention the double sonic  
booms  Having taken various relevant classes I have several ideas of where  
they come from but none of them are very convincing  Exactly what causes  
them  Are they a one time pheneomenon or a constant one like the supersonic  
shockwave that is constantly produced by a plane but you hear only when it  
goes over you

  Magellan has completed  orbits of Venus and is now  days from
the end of Cycle and the start of the Transition Experiment
Sorry I think I missed a bit of info on this Transition Experiment What is it

  On Monday morning April  the moon will occult Venus and
interrupt the tracking of Magellan for about  minutes
Will this mean a loss of data or will the Magellan transmit data later on 

BTW When will NASA cut off the connection with Magellan Not that I am
looking forward to that day but I am just curious I believe it had something
to do with the funding from the goverment or rather NO funding 

ok that's it for now See you guys around

Hi
  
  I'm writing a science fiction script and I'm looking for some
answers to questions regarding the Moon and Earth My starting point
is an impossible situation  I checked with a professor at berkeley
and his response was a VERY helpful can't happen If you enjoy
playing with unusual ideas and are willing answer some questions
please contact me via email jennisedgicom

  I get extremely annoyed when screen and teleplays ignore basic
facts about computers that I'm determined to be as scientifically
accurate as I can


  Sorry for being vague but I'd like to protect my idea as much as I
can until I'm ready to sell it hopefully

ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 

Flight V was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS series 
Galaxy IV satellite but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight

The th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA C and ARSENE 
satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit GTO with 
inclination reduced to  degrees and apogee altitude increased by  km
This will be the th launch of an Ariane  and the first in the L 
configuration with  liquid strapon boosters PAL  It will be launched
from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA  in Kourou  French 
Guiana

The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is  kg
of which  kg represents the satellite mass  The total vehicle mass
at liftoff is  kg


Required Orbit Characteristics

LAUNCH VEHICLE

Ariane L  This is a threestage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid 
fueled strapon boosters  The first stage L is built by Aerospatiale
and is powered by  liquid fueled Viking V engines  The second stage L
is built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine  Both the
Viking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP  The first and second stages
use a biliquid UHNO fuel The third stage H is built by Aerospatiale
and is powered by a cryogenic HO fueled HMB engine built by SEP The two
strapon boosters PAL are each powered by a Viking VI engine also built 
by SEP which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages  
The fully assembled launch vehicle stands  meters high on the pad  
It uses the Type  Ariane Short payload fairing

LAUNCH COVERAGE

All Ariane missions are broadcast live via satellite from Kourou 
Coverage begins at  minutes before launch and continues until 
all payloads have been deployed  This mission will likely be carried
in the US on Galaxy  however it could be Galaxy  or another satellite
What is the European satellite normally used for Ariane coverage

Oh gee a billion dollars  That'd be just about enough to cover the cost of the
feasability study  Happy Happy JOY JOY

Depends If you assume the existance of a working SSTO like DC on billion
 would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the
moon If some of that mass went to send equipment to make LOX for the
transfer vehicle you could send a lot more Either way its a lot
more than needed

This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO but it is
enough to do it if the vehicle exists

I think if there is to be a prize and such There should be classes
such as the following

Large Corp
Small CorpCompany based on reported earnings
Large Government GNP and such
Small Governemtn or political clout or GNP
Large Organization Planetary Society and such
Small Organization Alot of small orgs

The organization things would probably have to be nonprofit or liek 

Of course this means the prize might go up Larger get more or 
Basically make the prize total purse  billion divided amngst the class
winners
More fair

There would have to be a seperate organization set up to monitor the events
umpire and such and watch for safety violations or maybe not if peopel want
to risk thier own lives let them do it

Any other ideas

	Kudos to Mark for his generous offer but there already exists a
large emailbased forwarding system for scispace posts  Space Digest
It mirrors scispace exactly and provides simple twoway communication

I think Mark was talking about making it available to people who didn't
have email in the first place

If anybody in the Boston area wants a scispace feed by honesttogosh UUCP

This is turning into 'what's a moonbase good for' and I ought
not to post when I've a hundred some odd posts to go but I would
think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic
Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much
larger GNP than they would without space industry eventually
they will simply be able to afford more stuff

If I read you right you're saying in essence that with a larger
economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste
on a lunar facility That was certainly partially the case with Apollo
but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military
scientific or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have
the money why not approach

I was assuming that there won't be a moon base unless it makes a
profit actually  If it does well that gives a larger GNP which
leads to being able to spend more money on your military including
goshwow space stuff  assuming it's profitable rather than paying
for itself

It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose it's possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose but it's most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least Therefore Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases Can you
put a  person base on the Moon for  million a year Even if you
use grad students

You might be able to run one for that put it there hardly

Why do you think at least a couple centuries before there will
be significant commerical activity on the Moon

   I saw in the newspaper last night that Dr Mae Jemison the first
black woman in space she's a physician and chemical engineer who flew
on Endeavour last year will appear as a transporter operator on the
Star Trek The Next Generation episode that airs the week of May 
It's hardly space science I know but it's interesting

Joint Press release ESAUN No 
Paris  April 

UNESA joint training course on satellite applications
to be held in Italy  April

The United Nations and the European Space Agency ESA
are jointly organising a training course on the applications of
satellite data gathered by the European Remote Sensing
Satellite ERS to be held in Frascati Italy from  to 
April The training course will discuss the applications of
satellite data concerning natural resources renewable energy
and the environment

The training course organised for the benefit of francophone
African experts will be hosted by ESRIN the European Space
Agency's establishment in Frascati which is responsible for
coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing
satellite Twentyfour experts in the field of remote sensing
selected from  francophone countries from northern western
and central Africa and three regional African centres will
attend the twoweek session The course will focus on remote
sensing techniques and data applications particularly ERS
data

The ERS satellite developed by ESA and launched in 
with the European Ariane launcher carries an advanced radar
instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing
missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year
 The aim of the training course is to increase the
potential of experts using the practical applications of radar
remote sensing systems to natural resources renewable energy
and the environment with particular emphasis on applications
to geology and mineral prospecting oceanography and near
coastal areas agriculture forestry and meteorology

The education and practical training programme was
developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA The
facilities and the technical support as well as lecturers and
information documents for the training course will be
provided by the Agency Lecturers at the training course will
include highlevel experts from other European and African
organisations active in remote sensing applications Funds for
the training course are being provided by the United Nations



Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy the
primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy

A similar training course is being planned for Latin American
experts

  On Monday morning April  the moon will occult Venus and
interrupt the tracking of Magellan for about  minutes

Will this mean a loss of data or will the Magellan transmit data later on 

The gravity data is collected in realtime and it not recorded to the tape
recorder  However you only need to collect the gravity every rd or th
orbit so there is no real data loss if the Moon blocks transmission for
a short while

BTW When will NASA cut off the connection with Magellan Not that I am
looking forward to that day but I am just curious I believe it had something
to do with the funding from the goverment or rather NO funding 

The aerobraking starts May  and is expected last about  days  If the
funding is provided  million dollars to extend the mission for the
high resolution gravity data then the mission will last through October 
Otherwise the mission will end this coming July

I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
 Sails

I was at an interesting seminar at work UK's RAL Space Science
Dept on this subject specifically on a smallscale Solar Sail
proposed as a student space project The guy giving the talk was keen to
generate interest in the project I'll typein the handout he gave out at
the meeting Here goes  

			The Microlight Solar Sail
			

 Introduction
The solar sail is a wellestablished concept Harnessing the pressure of
sunlight a spacecraft would have unlimited range In principle such a
vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption

However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most
people realize The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per
square kilometer Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized
fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type
spacecraft is a daunting task This is why despite the potential of hte
idea no such craft has actually been launched to date

Design
Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept a
tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely
be electronics with no mechanical parts Several attitude control
methods are feasible for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a
panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn

The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at
Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data
gathering device solar cells providing  watt power for control and
communication and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface
of the sail itself Launched as a piggyback payload the total cost of
the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars

Missions
The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions For example
a It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor
groups Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit
rate
b It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit Previously unobserved
areas around the lunar poles could be viewed By angling the sail to
reflect sunlight downwards polar craters whose bases never receive
sunlight could be imaged Bright reflections would confirm that
volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these
locationsImmensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar
base BTW
c It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet
nucleus Impacting at low speed a thin wire probe attached to the craft
causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharpedged
tube like performing a biopsy Returning to Earth the sail acts as an
ideal reentry parachute load per unit area  gmm ensures that heat
is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed 
deg C The material sample is recovered enclosed in a small insulating
container

This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO but it is
enough to do it if the vehicle exists

Actually there are people who will tell you that it would be enough
to do SSTO development if done privately as a cutrate operation  Of
course they may be overoptimistic

You can also assume that a working SSTO would have other applications
that would help pay for its development costs

I'd be inclined to make the prize somewhat larger but G might be enough

It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose it's possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose but it's most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least Therefore Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases Can you
put a  person base on the Moon for  million a year Even if you
use grad students

You might be able to run one for that put it there hardly

Why do you think at least a couple centuries before there will
be significant commerical activity on the Moon

Wishful thinking mostly It's more likely that the Moon will never
be the site of major commercial activity As far as we know it has no
materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids
and comets aside from the semimythic He that might be useful in low
grade fusion reactors Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch 
and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat 
sink capacity could offer some military utility for high ground military
weapons systems but it holds very minute commercial value If space 
travel becomes cheap enough it might become a tourist attraction as 
Mt Everest and the Antarctic have become but that's a very minor 
activity in the global scope of things

Luna has an inconvienent gravity field It's likely too low to prevent
calcium loss muscle atrophy and long term genetic drift Yet it's
too high to do microG manufacturing Space based colonies and factories
that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better Luna
has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month but orbital
sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure Luna offers
a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials heatsink
and shielding The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and
heavy elements and volatile compounds and many are in less steep gravity
wells so that less deltav is required to reach them

We don't use rds of the Earth now the seafloors and we virtually
ignore Antarctica a whole continent That's because we don't have to
deal with those conditions in order to make a buck Luna is a much more
expensive place to visit or to live and work I think we'll use the
easier places first That pushes Lunar development back at least a few
centuries if not much longer

Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio
astronomy observatory shielded from the noisy Earth Or as the site
of a laser particle beam or linear accelerator weapons system for
defending Earth or bombarding it as the case may be The first is
unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument
The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good
enough and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for
conventional warfare again There's little glory in watching from a
bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges Little
ultimate profit either

   If I read you right you're saying in essence that with a larger
   economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a
   lunar facility That was certainly partially the case with Apollo
   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing
   military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than
   just a we have the money why not approach

Ah but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not
wasted on the moon It's not like they'd be using  R bills
to fuel their moondozers The money to fund a lunar base would be
spent in the country to which the base belonged It's a way of funding
hightech research just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various
fields of research under the pretense that it was crucial to the
defense of the country or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to
fund research under the pretense that it's good for panEuropean
cooperation

Now maybe you think that governmentfunded research is a waste of
money in fact I'm pretty sure you do but it does count as
investment spending which does boost the economy and just look at
the size of that multiplier 

Actually I favor government funded research It is a pump prime
for a lot of basic technologies I also understand the short term
value of high tech welfare programs But they can't substitute for
long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise That's what's
needed to maintain a healthy economy anywhere on Earth or Luna
I don't see that long term potential on Luna due to a bunch of
factors I outline in another post

From Gene Wright genetheporchraidernet

With the continuin talk about the End of the Space Age and complaints
by government over the large cost why not try something I read about
that might just work

Announce that a reward of  billion would go to the first corporation
who successfully keeps at least  person alive on the moon for a year
Then you'd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin
to be developed THere'd be a different kind of space race then

I'll say  Imagine that there were a couple groups up there maybe landing
a few weeks apart  The yearmark starts coming on for the first group
Isn't a billion pretty good incentive to take a shot at a potential
winner  Yeah that's a shame that Team A's life support gave out
so close to the deadline  Thanks for the billion

On the other hand if Apollo cost billion for a few days or weeks
in space in  dollars then won't the reward have to be a lot more
than only  billion to get any takers

I think if there is to be a prize and such There should be classes
such as the following

Small CorpCompany based on reported earnings
Large Government GNP and such
Small Governemtn or political clout or GNP

Small Organization Alot of small orgs

Whatabout Schools Universities Rich Individuals around  people

from people who claimed they might get a person into space for

among the ground crew

The organization things would probably have to be nonprofit or liek 

Of course this means the prize might go up Larger get more or 
Basically make the prize total purse  billion divided amngst the class
winners
More fair

There would have to be a seperate organization set up to monitor the events
umpire and such and watch for safety violations or maybe not if peopel want
to risk thier own lives let them do it

Agreed I volunteer for any UK attempts But one clause No launch methods
which are clearly dangerous to the environment ours or someone else's No
usage of materials from areas of planetary importance

Any other ideas

Yes We should do this rather than talk about it Lobby people

 I remeber reading the comment that General Dynamics was tied into this in 
 connection with their proposal for an early manned landing 

The General Chairman is Paul Bialla who is some official of General
Dynamics

The emphasis seems to be on a scaleddown fast plan to put people
on the Moon in an impoverished spaceflightfunding climate You'd
think it would be a golden opportunity to do lots of precusor work for
modest money using an agressive series of robot spacecraft but
there's not a hint of this in the brochure

It may be that they just didn't mention it or that they actually haven't 
thought about it  I got the vague impression from their mission proposal
that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing  They
seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without 
explaining why or what they would do once they got there  The only application
I remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon  That's
great but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically 

 Hrumph  They didn't send me anything 

You're not hanging out with the Right People apparently

But I'm a member  Besides Bill I hang out with you

I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
 Sails

I was at an interesting seminar at work UK's RAL Space Science
Dept on this subject specifically on a smallscale Solar Sail
proposed as a student space project The guy giving the talk was keen to
generate interest in the project I'll typein the handout he gave out at
the meeting Here goes  

Stuff deleted 

However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most
people realize The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per
square kilometer                                            

I'm glad to see that someone is working on this  However it would be nice if
he got his units right

a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me help me out Josh

Subject Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts

Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts  For
example Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a safe
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a lowpoweruse mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better hopefully it could be turned on again  

For that matter why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments
turned off rather than just safed  Was it political ie
as along as they could be used someone would keep bugging
congress for funds  Turning them off keeps them pesky
scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair  

I've heard the argument that an active but uncontrolled
spacecraft causes radio noise  I find that hard to believe
that this could be a problem in a properly designed safe mode
This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the
spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation and once a
week month year whatever attempts a signal lock on Earth
At that time if funding has been restored the mission can
continue  If no signal is recieved the spacecraft goes back to
the safe mode for another time period As we would know when the
spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth we could be
prepared if necessary  

As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is
beam stored data towards Earth  If someone can receive it
great if not so it's lost and no big deal
By making the time and signal location generally known perhaps
someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the
data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft

I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which
could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to
places which are otherwise unaccessible JupiterSaturn Orbit
exiting the solar system etc   

Perhaps those designing future spacecraft Cassini Pluto Flyby
etc should consider designing in a pause mode in case their
spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of
the primary mission Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could
have some kind of routine written in for the post mission
drift phase

So any holes in all this

  be the site of major commercial activity As far as we know it has no
  materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids
  and comets aside from the semimythic He that might be useful in low
  grade fusion reactors

I don't know what a low grade fusion reactor is but the major
problem with He aside from the difficulty in making any fusion
reactor work is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so
small  on the order of  ppb or so on average more in some
fractions but still very small  Massive amounts of regolith would
have to be processed

This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon
as a source of titanium for use on earth  As I recall Wingo wasn't
content with being assured that titanium at  in the Earth's crust
average would not run out and touted lunar mines even though the
market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around pound
This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources

On the moon titanium occurs in basalts highTi basalts Apollo 
and  have  titanium dioxide by weight  This is nice but
terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in
titanium  They very often have  TiO frequently have  and
sometimes even  TiO again by weight  These flood basalts are
enormous  millions of cubic kilometers scattered all over the
world Siberia Brazil the NW United States Ethiopia etc  If
even  of the basalts are  TiO this is trillions of tons of TiO
at concentrations only a factor of  less than in lunar highTi
basalts  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon
could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the
ore never mind the richer but less common terrestrial ores being
mined today

 Sorry perijovesI'm not used to talking this language

Hmmmm  The prefix peri is Greek not Latin so it's usually used
with the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited  That's why
it's perihelion rather than perisol perigee rather than periterr
and pericynthion rather than perilune  So for Jupiter I'd expect it

Well there already is a sulfate process for TiO purification  The
chlorine process is cleaner however and for that reason is achieving

Most Ti is used in pigment btw as the oxide where it replaced

WHAT'S NEW in my opinion Friday  April   Washington DC

 SPACE BILLBOARDS IS THIS ONE THE SPINOFFS WE WERE PROMISED
In  science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published The
Man Who Sold the Moon which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the Moon for use as billboard NASA has taken the firsteps toward this
 hideous vision of the future  Observers were
startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with SCHWARZENEGGER painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets  Space Marketing Inc had arranged
for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie Now Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a milelong inflatable billboard in lowearth
orbit  NASA would provide contractual launch services However
since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
WN  Mar  the taxpayers would bear most of the expense This
may look like environmental vandalism but Mike Lawson CEO of
Space Marketing told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment The platform will carry ozone
monitors he explainedadvertising is just to help defray costs


What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky It is not even April  anymore
What about light pollution in observations I read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day leave alone at night
Is NASA really supporting this junk
Are protesting groups being organized in the States
Really really depressed

 I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
  Sails 
 Are there any groups out there currently involved in such a project 

Bill says 

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman
a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me help me out Josh

I presume the one you refer to is Space Sailing by Jerome L Wright  He 
worked on solar sails while at JPL and as CEO of General Astronautics  I'll
furnish ordering info upon request

The Friedman book is called Starsailing Solar Sails and Interstellar Travel
It was available from the Planetary Society a few years ago I don't know if
it still is

Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a ProtonCentaur combo


I don't know a whole lot on Proton but given that it is a multi stage
rocket  up to  stages it may not really need the Centaur  plus
it may end up seriously beating on said centaur   

Also the centaur is not small  unless the Proton has an oversize
shroud you may not be able to get the centaur in under it

WHAT'S NEW in my opinion Friday  April   Washington DC

 SPACE BILLBOARDS IS THIS ONE THE SPINOFFS WE WERE PROMISED
What about light pollution in observations I read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day leave alone at night
Is NASA really supporting this junk
Are protesting groups being organized in the States
Really really depressed

             Enzo

I wouldn't worry about it  There's enough space debris up there that
a milelong inflatable would probably deflate in some very short
period of time less than a year while cleaning up LEO somewhat
Sort of a giant flypaper in orbit

Hmm that could actually be useful

As for advertising  sure why not  A NASA friend and I spent one
drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need
to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization
on the face of the Moon  Fortunately we sobered up in the morning

Okay here is what I have so far

Have a group any size preferibly small but send a human being to the moon
set up a habitate and have the humans spend one earth year on the moon Does
that mean no resupply or  

Need to find atleast billion for prize money

Contest open to different classes of participants

New Mexico State has semichallenged University of Alaska any branch to put a
team together and to do it
Any other UniversityCollegeInstitute of Higher Learning wish to make a
counter challenge or challenge another school Say it here

I like the idea of having atleast a russian team


Some prefer using new technology others old or 

The basic idea of the New Moon Race is like the Solar Car Race acrossed
Australia Atleast in that basic vein of endevour

Any other suggestions

Summary Hmm

Hmm   billion lesse I can probably launch  tons to LEO at
 million in five years which gives about  tons to the lunar
surface oneway  Say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its
fuel a bigger Mercury or something might get that as low as two
tons leaving fifteen tons for a oneman habitat and a year's supplies
Gee with that sort of mass margins I can build the systems off
the shelf for about another hundred million tops  That leaves
about  million profit  I like this idea   Let's see
if you guys can push someone to make it happen

I hear insert favorite rumor here that it will supposedly coincide

Even worse the city of Atlanta has a proposal before it to rent space on this
orbiting billboard  Considering the caliber of people running this city 
there's no telling what we're going to have leering down at us from orbit

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity  For a target  km above the surface of Earth
you need a deltav of  kms  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of  seconds are easy to produce a rocket with a dry
weight of  kg would require only about  kg of fueloxidizer
A small dispersal charge embedded in about  kg of sand or
birdshot depending on the nature of the structure would be
the payload  I am sure the whole project is well within
the capability of the amateur rocketry community

It sounds like a good Science Fair project'Reduction
of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'
Or it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed
here  billion for the first person to spend  year
on the moon  million for the first erradication of
an orbital eyesoreCCD burner  I wouldpledge 
for the first person to bring it down and I am sure
there are at least  other astronomers nature lovers
or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise

Of course a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler

of a large caliber gun or the solution which was applied

So how much would it cost as a private venture assuming you could talk the
US government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida 

Why would you want to do that The goal is to do it cheaper remember
this isn't government Instead of leasing an expensive launch pad
just use a SSTO and launch from a much cheaper facility

   given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level  in
   maturity I strongly doubt that this having lots of bugs is the case

   Level   Out of how many  What are the different levels  I've never
   heard of this rating system  Anyone care to clue me in

This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to
measure the maturity of a software process' ie the entire process
by which software gets designed written tested delivered supported
etc

See Managing the Software Process' by Watts S Humphrey Addison
Wesley  An excellent software engineering text The  levels of
software process maturity are

 Initial
 Repeatable
 Defined
 Managed
 Optimizing

The levels are approximately characterized as follows

 no statistically software process control Have no statistical
   basis for estimating how large software will be how long it will
   take to produce how expensive it will be or how reliable it will
   be  Most software production is at this level

 stable process with statistical controls rigorous project
   management having done something once can do it again Projects
   are planned in detail and there is software configuration
   management and quality assurance

 The process is defined and understood implementation is
   consistent This includes things like software inspection a
   rigorous software testing framework more configuration management
   and typically a software engineering process group' within the
   project

 Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered
   and analysed and the process is controlled on the basis of this
   information Software quality is measured and has goals

 Defects are prevented the process is automated software contracts
   are effective and certified

Level   Out of how many  What are the different levels  I've never

SEI Level  the highest level  the SEI stands for Software
Engineering Institute  I'm not sure but I believe that this rating
only applies to the flight software  Also keep in mind that it was
not achieved through the use of sophisticated tools but rather
through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the
Challenger standdown  they simply threw hundreds of people at it and
did the whole process by hand  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning'
status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much if
anything from such a rating  I'll have to get the latest copy of
the guidelines to make sure they just issued new ones I think

Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with
control of the software process the assumption is that a
well controlled process will produce good software  Also keep in mind
that SEI Level  is DAMNED HARD  Most software in this country is
produced by 'engineering practicies' that only rate an SEI Level  if
that

This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO but it is
enough to do it if the vehicle exists

Actually there are people who will tell you that it would be enough
to do SSTO development if done privately as a cutrate operation  Of
course they may be overoptimistic

In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of I think their
cost estimates are a bit overoptimistic If nothing else a working SSTO
is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
base It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as
much as a typical airliner development That puts it in the G to G
range

You can also assume that a working SSTO would have other applications
that would help pay for its development costs

True it and the contest would result in a much larger market But I
don't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the
risks involved

If you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures
 of the available launch market then I think you could
do it

All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race ie G to the first year 
moon base is intriguing Similar prizes have influenced aerospace 
development before The k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of 
Saint Louis venture to his financial backers

If memory serves the k prize would not have been enough to totally 
reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects such as 
Fokker's Nungesser and other multiengine projects However Lindbergh 
ultimately kept his total costs below that amount

But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to 
realize that much more was at stake than 

Could it work with the moon Who are the farsighted financial backers of

The face is an accident of light and shadow  There are many faces in
landforms on Earth none is artificial well excluding Mount Rushmore and
the like  There is also a smiley face on Mars and a Kermit The Frog

The question of life in a more mundane sense  bacteria or the like  is
not quite closed although the odds are against it and the most that the
more orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils

There are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life

Mars Observer currently approaching Mars will probably try to get a better
image or two of the face at some point  It's not high priority nobody
takes it very seriously  The shadowed half of the face does not look very

I think this is a little inaccurate based on Feynman's account of the
softwaredevelopment process before the standdown  Fred is basically
correct  no sophisticated tools just a lot of effort and painstaking
care  But they got this one right before Challenger Feynman cited
the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people  He
also noted that the software people were starting to feel management
pressure to cut corners but hadn't had to give in to it much yet

Among other things the software people worked very hard to get things
right for the major preflight simulations and considered a failure
during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an inflight failure
As a result the number of majorsimulation failures could be counted
on one hand and the number of inflight failures was zero

As Fred mentioned elsewhere this applies only to the flight software
Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the
experimenters and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care
None of the experimenters could afford it

  The commercial uses of a transportation system between alreadysettled
andcivilized areas are obvious  Spaceflight is NOT in this position
The correct analogy is not with aviation of the ''s but the long
transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery  It didn't require gov't to
fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit
at the destination  In practice some were gov't funded some were private
But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount
of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff
  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop
and large numbers of people will live and work offEarth  But if you ask
me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base I
can't give them  We just don't know enough  The launch rate demanded by
existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much and
we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries
will be when they will practical how much will have to be invested to
start them etc

Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts  For
example Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a safe
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a lowpoweruse mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better hopefully it could be turned on again  

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now
you may not be able to later  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a turn off command successfully  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can
no longer be turned off

Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a ProtonCentaur combo

I don't know a whole lot on Proton but given that it is a multi stage
rocket  up to  stages it may not really need the Centaur  plus
it may end up seriously beating on said centaur   

The Proton has been used in   and  stage versions  The two stage version
was used for the first  launches while the  and  stage versions are used
today  The four stage version is used mostly for escape and geosynchronous
orbits while the  stage version is used for low earth orbits  Since this is
the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts and the addon modules for Mir
as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir which I believe it is it should fit
under the shroud

I vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LHLOX upper stage for the
Proton

	don't forget  a HUGE  cost for airliner developement is FAA
certification  the joke is when the paperwork  exceeds teh weight

The SR and teh X  both highly ambitious  aerospace projects were done
on very narrow engineering budgets   Partly because they didn't spend much
on paper  pushing   There is some company in missouri  trying to

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity  For a target  km above the surface of Earth
you need a deltav of  kms  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of  seconds are easy to produce a rocket with a dry
weight of  kg would require only about  kg of fueloxidizer

Unfortunately if you launch this from the US or are a US citizen
you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space
Transportation and I think it may be difficult to get a permit for
an antisatellite weapon 

The threshold at which OCST licensing kicks in is roughly km
The rules are actually phrased in more complex ways but that is
the result

WHAT'S NEW in my opinion Friday  April   Washington DC

 SPACE BILLBOARDS IS THIS ONE THE SPINOFFS WE WERE PROMISED
In  science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published The
Man Who Sold the Moon which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the Moon for use as billboard NASA has taken the firsteps toward this
hideous vision of the future  Observers were
startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with SCHWARZENEGGER painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets  Space Marketing Inc had arranged
for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie

Well if you're going to get upset with this you might as well direct
some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well  They pioneered
this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA
Sign of the times a Sony logo on a Soyuz launcher

Now Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a milelong inflatable billboard in lowearth
orbit

This sounds like something Lowell Wood would think of  Does anyone
know if he's involved

NASA would provide contractual launch services However
since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
WN  Mar  the taxpayers would bear most of the expense This
may look like environmental vandalism but Mike Lawson CEO of
Space Marketing told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment The platform will carry ozone
monitors he explainedadvertising is just to help defray costs

This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people  My
guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to
build large inflatable space structures


What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky It is not even April  anymore

If this is true I think it's a great idea

Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential
step towards space development and given that Freedom appears to be
shrinking towards the vanishing point I question whether NASA's space
station is going to provide much if any knowledge in this area
Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen
If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates
creative use of partial private sector funding in the process  so
much the better

Is NASA really supporting this junk

And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
news blip  How serious is this project  Is this just in the wild
idea stage or does it have real funding

Are protesting groups being organized in the States

Not yet  Though if this project goes through I suppose The Return
of Jeremy Rifkin is inevitable

 This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO but it is
 enough to do it if the vehicle exists
 
 Actually there are people who will tell you that it would be enough
 to do SSTO development if done privately as a cutrate operation  Of
 course they may be overoptimistic
 
 In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of I think their
 cost estimates are a bit overoptimistic If nothing else a working SSTO
 is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
 base It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as
 much as a typical airliner development That puts it in the G to G
 range
 

For the purpose of a contest I'd bet some things could be cut  Like fuel
for reentry any kind of heat shielding etc etc  Even still if the
contest participants had to fund DC development it probably wouldn't be
worth it to develop DC just for the contest  Just give me the cheapest
heaviest lift man rated or at least under  or so Gs booster  If I
don't have to pay for DC development great I'll use it

But back to the contest goals there was a recent article in AWST about a
low cost it's all relative manned return to the moon  A General
Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV  Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper
stage LEV and crew capsule  The mission consists of delivering two
unmanned payloads to the lunar surface followed by a manned mission 
Total cost  US was  billion  Joint ESANASA project was 
billion for the US share

I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay but I'd bet that
its  around  days  And the total payload delivered was about  metric
tonnes  So if you ignore the scientific payload hitch a ride in the crew
habitation module no return trip and toss in a few more tonnes for
the additional consumables to last another  months then you might be
able to get a year visit out of  tonnes and in case its not obvious
that's a wild ass guess  A pretty boring visit since every trip outdoors
eats up a bit of LOX  And I'm not certain if a home brewed or
collegebrewed life support system could last a year  But let's round
this up to  tonnes convient since the GD plan talks about  ton
payloads delivered to the lunar surface  This adds up to two Centaurs two
LEVs two Shuttle flights All to put a single man on the moon for a
year   Hmmm  Not really practical  Anyone got a cheaperbetter way of
delivering  tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade  Anyone
have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and
equipment would weigh

And I was wondering about the GD LEV  Is it reusable  Or is it discarded
to burn up on return to LEO  If its not discarded could it be refueled 
Henry Do you know anything about the GD LEV  I noted that it uses RL
engines  Aren't they reusablerestartable  Would a LEV fit in a DC 
I've forgotten if I ever knew what the cargo bay dimensions are for the
DC

All in all I'm not certain that the single goalprize of staying on the
moon for a year is wise andor useful  How about  A prize for the first
nongovernment sponsered unmanned moon landing then another for a manned
moon landing then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
lunar soil another for a reusable earthmoon shuttle and so forth  Find
some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure  Having a single goal
might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared
to win  And for those that didn't give up I find something a little scary
about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters  I'd
like to see as much a reward for cooperation as for competition

Lastly about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an
English space magazine that had an ongoing discussion about moonbases on
the cheap  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
body produced how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar
flares etc  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine 
Does this ring a bell to anyone

There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its
rings in May and July  Please spread the word  Here's some
information about the events and then a couple of messages from Jay
Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to
learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus  He might also have
some money available

John Spencer 

Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn
itself on   UT and again on 
 UT  Timing is as follows

      May 

        Aring ingress  
               egress   
        Bring ingress  
               egress   
        Cring egress   
        Saturn ingress  
               egress   
        Bring ingress  
               egress   
        Aring ingress  
               egress   

      July 

        Saturn ingress  
               egress   
        Aring ingress    grazing
               egress   

Times could be  minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris
and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'
orbit  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from
Iapetus is  km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about
the rings themselves from the observations  See Soma  Astronomy
and Astrophysics  LL for more details  Thanks to Andy Odell
of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my
attention

THERMAL OBSERVATIONS

Jay Goguen jdgscnJplNasaGov writes

  To me the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the  July
  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia
  etc  Unfortunately the  UT of this event renders it inaccessible
  except from Russia  Even from Calar Alto Saturn is rising through 
  airmasses at  UT  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with
  a big telescope and  um instrumentation that's looking for something
  to do  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of  for the data

  Jay

and again

  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet
  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths  My impression would
  be that it's not an easy observation  Iapetus will be faint and
  getting fainter in eclipse so you'll need a big telescope that's a
  good IR telescope and reasonable    um instrumentation  I don't
  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are
  well placed for observation  We need SOFIA for this one  One
  possibility would be the IR telescope in India but it's only a  m

Some time ago I sent the following message
   Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony  I'm gearing up to
   do another one  I'd some info from you If you were to move
   onto a space colony to live permanently how big would the colony have
   to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable  Specifically

   How many people do you want to share the colony with
 

   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have  


   Assume g living the colony will rotate  Assume that you can leave
   from time to time for vacations and business trips  If you're young
   enough assume that you'll raise your children there

I didn't get a lot of responses and they were all over the block
Thanx muchly to all those who responded it is good food for thought




Here's the edited responses I got


   How many people do you want to share the colony with
 


   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have  

Cylinder m diameter x  km long

Rui Sousa
rucasabersipt



   How many people do you want to share the colony with

  

   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have  

 square kms surface divided into city towns villages and
countryside  Must have lakes rivers amd mountains



 How many
   people really isn't that large a number
everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year and will probably
be sick of everyone else within another year

What physical dimensions does the living are need to have  

Hm  I am not all that great at figuring it out  But I would maximize the
percentage of colonyspace that is accessible to humans  Esecially if there
were to be children since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways
And everyone especially me likes to go exploringI would want to be able
to go for a walk and see something different each time



For population I think I would want a substantial town  big enough
to have strangers in it  This helps get away from the smalltown
everybody knows everything syndrome which some people like but
I don't  Call it several thousand people

For physical dimensions a somewhat similar criterion  big enough
to contain surprises at least until you spent considerable time
getting to know it  As a more specific rule of thumb big enough
for there to be places at least an hour away on foot  Call that
km which means a km circumference if we're talking a sphere

My desires for permanent move to a space colony assuming easy communication
and travel

Size  About a smalltown size say  sq km  'Course bigger is better 
Population  about sq km or less  So  for sqkm  Less is
better for elbow room more for interest and sanity so say max  min

Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts  For
example Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a safe
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a lowpoweruse mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better hopefully it could be turned on again  
 
It can be but the problem is a political one not a technical one

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode
probably a spinstabilized sunpointing orientation is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft  In order to turn the
spacecraft back on you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be
available or you need to retrain a new team

Having said that there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed
Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies like the Tiros NOAA 
series require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set
Extras which get replaced onorbit are powered into a standby mode for
use in an emergency  In that case however the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap

Finally Pat's explanation some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control is also right on the mark  I suggested a spin
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time

In the end it is a political decision since the difference is money
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision

Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a ProtonCentaur combo
What would be the benefits and problems with such a combo other
than the obvious instability in the XSSR now

I haven't seen any speculation about it But the Salyut KB Design Bureau 
was planning a new LHLOX second stage for the Proton which would boost
payload to LEO from about  to  kg Geostationary goes from
 kg Gals launcher version to  kg This scheme was competing
with the EnergiaM last year and I haven't heard which won except now
I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the 
successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the EnergiaM So the early
results are EnergiaM won but this is a guess nothing is very clear in 
Russia I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue 
their development 

The Centaur for the Altas is about  meters dia and the Proton 
is  so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage the BlockD
which sets inside a shround just under  meters dia I don't know about
launch loads etc but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which
are probably worse than the Proton those Titan SRB's probably shake things
up pretty good it seems feasible EXCEPT the Centaur is a very fragile
thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now
Protons are assembled and transported horizontially Does anyone know 
how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while
bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track
and erected on the pad  

They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads 
unless the new Proton second stage is actually built and of course
any Centaur support systems and facilities no doubt imported from the
US at great cost These systems may viloate US law so there are political
problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention

According to a Software engineering professor here what was actually rated

by not means all of it 

Interesting note  of the software development groups surveyed were at

The Centaur that is being built for T would be a better bet to integrate 
onto the Proton as the TCentaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh 
envorinment of the T launch It is also closer to  m in diameter 

You've hit on the real kicker however The Centaur is pressure stabilized 
It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks Additionally 
the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to   psi 
That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train The pressure 
stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance On numerous occasions
when I was there  the AF wanted to see what it would take to make 
a nonpressure stabilized centaur The answer  a centaur not worth launching 

The AtlasCentaur does not require onpad integration however the TCentaur
does I believe the onpad integration is to a great extent due to the 
cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration so maybe something can be 
done there


 
 They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads 
 unless the new Proton second stage is actually built and of course
 any Centaur support systems and facilities no doubt imported from the
 US at great cost These systems may viloate US law so there are political
 problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention 

The addition of LOXLH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it 
lifts off A LHe facility is also needed I don't know what the proton uses 
for fuel but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they 
use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's 
do If there is no cryo at the sight at all the addition of these systems 
could be big  not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with 
providing centaur GSE to Russia That issue alone might be enough to kill 
this idea

the sun even when powered down may burn it out  Pointing a
parabolic antenna  at Sol  from venus orbit  may trash the
foci  elements

What I was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be
possible to put enough brains on board future deepspace probes
for them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the
sun or going into an uncontrolled tumble  

I heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in
that essentially says If you never hear from Earth again
here's what to do  This was a back up in the event a receiver
burnt out but the probe could still send data limited but
still some data  

Even if you let teh bird drift  it may  get hosed by some
cosmic phenomena   

Since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for
startup if some type of cosmic BEM took out the probe it might
not be such a big loss  Obviously you can't plan for
everything but the most obvious things can be considered

 This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people  My
 guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to
 build large inflatable space structures
 

The CU people have been and continue to be big ozone scientists So 
this is consistent It is also consistent with the new Comercial 
applications that NASA and Clinton are pushing so hard 
 
 Is NASA really supporting this junk

Did anyone catch the rocket that was launched with a movie advert 
all over it I think the rocket people got alot of  for painting 
up the sides with the movie stuff What about the CokePepsi thing 
a few years back NASA has been trying to find ways to get other 
people into the space funding business for some time Frankly I've 
thought about trying it too When the funding gets tight only the 
innovative get funded One of the things NASA is big on is cofunding 
If a PI can show cofunding for any proposal that proposal has a SIGNIFICANTLY
higher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no 
cofunding Once again money talks

WHAT'S NEW in my opinion Friday  April   Washington DC

 SPACE BILLBOARDS IS THIS ONE THE SPINOFFS WE WERE PROMISED
In  science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published The
Man Who Sold the Moon which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the Moon for use as billboard NASA has taken the firsteps toward this
 hideous vision of the future  Observers were
startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with SCHWARZENEGGER painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets 

Things could be worse A lot worse In the mideighties the
teenadult scifi comic AD Fleetway produced a short story
featuring the award winning character Judge Dredd The story
focussed on an advertising agency of the future who use high powered
multicoloured laserssearch lights pointed at the moon to paint
images on the moon Needless to say this use hacked off a load of lovers
romantics and werewolfscrazies The ad guys got chopped the service
discontinued A cautionary tale indeed

Hiya 

I'm a VERY amuture astronomer in Adelaide Australia and today I heard some
very interesting and exciting news from a local program on TV As I couldn't
find anything on it on the news server I have posted this However if it is
old information tell me and ill sue the TV station for saying they are 
'Up to date' 

Also my news server could be slow  so   

I only caught the end of the article so all the information on the topic
is not known to me at the moment

The news is of a small 'psudo' planet outside the orbit of pluto found in a 
Hawiian obsevatory supposably 'recently'  acording to the report
It was meant to be about miles in diamater and a faily large distance 
from the plutos orbit  it had a computer drawing and the orbit distance
from pluto was about the same as neptune to pluto when they are furthest
apart  This is all I found out about it OH it is called Karna unofficially
  
CAn anyone give any more information to me on it

Thanx

Brendan Woithe

BTW  if this is old news does anyone know a good lawyer

for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie

Well if you're going to get upset with this you might as well direct
some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well  They pioneered
this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA

In fact you can all direct your ire at the proper target by ingoring NASA 
altogether  The rocket is a commercial launch vechicle  a Conestoga flying 
a COMET payload  NASA is simply the primary customer  I believe SDIO has a
small payload as well  The advertising space was sold by the owners of the
rocket who can do whatever they darn well please with it  In addition these
anonymous observers had no reason to be startled  The deal made Space News
at least twice 

Now Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a milelong inflatable billboard in lowearth
orbit
NASA would provide contractual launch services However
since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
WN  Mar  the taxpayers would bear most of the expense 

Is NASA really supporting this junk

And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
news blip  How serious is this project  Is this just in the wild
idea stage or does it have real funding

I think its only fair to find that out before everyone starts having a hissy
fit  The fact that they bothered to use the conditional tense suggests that
it has not yet been approved

cookvarmitmdccom Layne Cook writes
 All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race ie G to the first year 
 moon base is intriguing Similar prizes have influenced aerospace 
development before The k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of 
 Saint Louis venture to his financial backers
 But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to 
 realize that much more was at stake than 
 Could it work with the moon Who are the farsighted financial backers of 
 today

  The commercial uses of a transportation system between alreadysettled
andcivilized areas are obvious  Spaceflight is NOT in this position
The correct analogy is not with aviation of the ''s but the long
transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery

Lindbergh's flight took place in ' not the thirties

It didn't require gov't to
fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit
at the destination  In practice some were gov't funded some were private

Could you give examples of privately funded ones

But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount
of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff

Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies  However the
concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons I 
suspect  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic 
benefit from Lindbergh's flight  Modern analogies such as the prize for a
human powered helicopter face similar arguments  There is little economic
benefit in such a thing  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed
and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the 
equivalent amount of direct investment would  A person who puts up  X billion
for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done
than because they expect to make money off the deal

I have a nice quote that I like or as close as I can remember it

If I say something that you think is crazy ask me what I mean before you think
its crazy 

So some of my ideas are a bit odd off the wall and such but so was Wilbur and
Orville Wright and quite a few others Sorry if I do not have the big degrees
and such but I think I might be wrong to error is human I have something
that is in many ways just as important I have imagination dreams And without
dreams all the knowledge is worthless 

Sorry my two cents worth Or is it two rubles worth

The basic quote idea is from H Beam Pipers book Space Vikings Its a good
book on how civilization can fall and how it can be raised to new heights

Unfortunately H Beam Piper killed him self just weeks short of having his
first book published and have his ideas see light Such a waste

Hi
    I was reading through The Spaceflight Handbook and somewhere in
there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them
when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to
the sun in a hyperbolic orbit The magnitude of such accelerations he
estimated to be on the order of g He also says that this is may not
be a big problem for manned craft because humans and this was published
in  have already withstood accelerations of g All this is very
longwinded but here's my question finally  Are g accelerations in
fact humanly tolerable  with the aid of any mechanical devices of
course If these are possible what is used to absorb the acceleration
Can this be extended to larger accelerations

Thanks is advance

Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral
exploration

Basically get the ecifreaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth
You think this is crazy Well in a way it is but in a way it is reality

There is a billin the congress to do just that Basically to make it so
expensive to mine minerals in the US unless you can by off the inspectors or
tax collectors ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends 
of mine that they the congress propose to have a tax on the gross income of
the mine versus the adjusted income also the state governments have there
normal taxes So by the time you get done paying for materials workers and
other expenses you can owe more than what you made
BAsically if you make a  and spend  ofor expenses you can owe
 in federal taxes Bascially it is driving the miners off the land And
the only peopel who benefit are the ecofreaks 

Basically to get back to my beginning statement is space is the way to go
cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the
ecofreaks or the protectionist 
Such fun we have in these interesting times

                               SSRT ROLLOUT

                Speech Delivered by Col Simon P Worden
                     The Deputy for Technology SDIO
                                    
                  Mcdonnell Douglas  Huntington Beach
                              April 

     Most of you as am I are children of the 's  We grew
up in an age of miracles  InterContinental Ballistic Missiles
nuclear energy computers flights to the moon  But these were
miracles of our parent's doing  For a decade and more the pundits
have told us  you've lost it  The me generation is only
living on the accomplishments of the past

     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists  We
listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs  Living
history they are  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell
of it  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as
General Bernie Schriever told of his team's work  and yes struggle
 to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile

     What stories can we tell  Blurryeyed telescopes  Thousand
dollar toilet seats  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only
of that past great time  They are and seem destined to remain Gen
Schriever's ICBMs  I find it hard to swell with pride that the
best new spacelifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and
Poseidon ballistic missiles

     Well  The pessimists are wrong  The legacy is continuing 
This event is proof  To our technological parents We've listened
to your stories  We've caught your enthusiasm and cando spirit 
And we've learned from your achievements  and your mistakes  Let
me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus
behind this history  Max Hunter  You are one of the greatest
engineers of the firts great age of space exploration  Your
insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM  later incorporated
into today's most successful launch vehicle  The Delta

     You told us in the 's that a new form of launch vehicle  a
single stage reusable rocket  can and should be built  You
advocated this idea tirelessly  It was elegantly simple as are
all great breakthroughs  You showed us how to build it  You
convinced us it could be done  You are working by our side to weld
its components into place  Most important  you reminded us of a
prime engineering principle  undoubtably one you learned from the
generation before you  the generation that built transcontinental
aviation in the 's and 's  build a little and test a little
and Max you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who
started this program for the SDI

     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC  They didn't even
start with a DC  Our grandfathers built a little tested a
little  even sold a little and made a little money  before they
moved on to the next step  They didn't take a decade or more
before putting the first rubber on the road  Max Hunter  you
didn't take ten years to build Thor and by God we're not going to
take ten years to show that low cost single stage reusable
aerospace transportation is real

     We ended the cold war in a few short years  It took the  same
team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic
Defense Initiative that the cold war must end  We  you and us 
launched a series of satellites  The Delta experiments  in about
a year apiece  This more than anything else signaled our
commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet
Union  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored
the importance of our work in bringing about a new international
relationship

     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the
framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the
next generation  We will make space access routine and affordable

     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years  This
summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the
first time  Then we can and surely will build in the next three
years a reusable suborbital rocket  It will allow us to use space
rapidly affordably and efficiently as no other nation can  And
yes  we'll make a little money off it too

     Then  and only then  we'll spend another three years to
build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system  The DC of
space will be a reality  We may even be able to use some of the
rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries 
What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to
counter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars

     To be sure we must guard against the temptations to leap to
the final answer  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn
V's  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra
dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital
system  we will fail  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the
way  Three years and a cloud of dust  in our case rocket
exhausts  There is no shortcut  If we expect to reshape the
world again  we must do it one brick at a time  Minds on tasks at
hand

     This project is real  The torch of American technological
greatness is being passed  We are Americans  This machine is
American  Let's go fly it

                             April  


     What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble  For
providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the US
Space Foundation  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket
Technology rocket or SSRT  By I intend to speak of more  How to
lower the cost and make rapid progress  SSRT is to my mind 
and I hope to convince you  the erupting a new rallying cry for
our generation in space  Faster Cheaper and Better

     Faster Cheaper Better and SSRT represent the passing of a
torch from one technical generation to another  It is a new
thing to be sure  but it is also a relearning of old things
from past masters

     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago so called
experts told us it violates the laws of physics  it made no
sense  For example Dr Eberhart Rachtin  former president of
the Aerospace Corp said of SSRT in the LA Times that it
defies the best principles of launching payloads into space 
Well Dr Rachtin  you've made us mad  What are these
principles that SSRT defies

     Well I'll tell you  It violates the principle that you need
a giant program office to build space hardware  It violates the
fact that it takes  years to build something new  And it
violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for
less than many billions of dollars

     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us
some newold lessons  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a
Saturn V  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to
demonstrate  And the X airplane didn't cost  billion

     It took one of the great engineers of the 's to remind
us of these truths  Max Hunter  Max to remind you was a
senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program and old faster better
cheaper success story  Max has been persistent in a vision of a
single stage reusable space launch system since the 's 
Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps  Build a
little Test a little

     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration  We
didn't solicit a bunch of requirements  they'd just change
every few years anyway   not included in the speech  The
ALSNLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better
known as Shape Shifter than Space Lifter  We didn't spend a
lot money  this XRocket only cost  million  When's the
last time we even built a new airplane for that  And it didn't
take a lot of time to build  McDonnell Douglas completed it in
 months  Finally the government program office consisted of
one very overworked Air Force Major  motivated in part by the
threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strappedon lawn chair if
it ran over cost or schedule

     As I described what SSRT is  and isn't keep in mind its
only a first step  There are several more steps  and steps
that can easily fail  before the US can field an SSTO  But
each step should follow the same principles  a small management
team  a few years technology demonstration  and a modest
budget

     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve
See charts

     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last
generation  the giants of the last great space era the 's
and 's  They went to the moon  we built a telescope that
can't see straight  They softlanded on Mars  the least we
could do is softland on Earth

     But we do have an answer  We can follow their build a
little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable
and routine access to space  I know there are nay sayers among
you  those who say SSRT is a stunt  It needs more thermal
protection the engines are wrong it would be better to land
horizontally etc etc

     I say to you  we'll see you at White Sands in June  You
bring your viewgraphs and I'll bring my rocketship  If we do
what we say we can do then you let us do the next step   not
included in the speech  If we fail  you still have your
program offices staff summary sheets requirement analyses and
decade long programs

     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter's idea  Any Takers

Well thank you dennis for your as usual highly detailed and informative 
posting   

The question i have about the proton is  could it be  handled at
one of KSC's spare pads without major  malfunction  or could it be
handled at kourou  or Vandenberg   

Now if it uses storables  then  how long would it take for the russians
to equip something at cape york

If  Proton were launched from a western site  how would it compare to the
Tcentaur   As i see it it should lift  very close to the T

Unfortunately H Beam Piper killed him self just weeks short of having his
first book published and have his ideas see light Such a waste


Piper lived in my town Williamsport PA when he killed himself  It
was in the early ''s  He had had more than a few books published by
that time but he was down on his luck financially  Rumor was that he
was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food  He viewed himself as
a resourceful man and IMO decided to check out gracefully if he
couldn't support himself  The worst part is that John Campbell the
longtime editor of AstoundingAnalog SF magazine had cut a check for
Piper's most recent story and said check was in the mail  If Campbell
had known Piper's straits I'm sure he would have phoned to say hang on
Campbell was like that

I wish it had happened differently  I always enjoyed Piper's stuff

Thanks again  One final question  The name Gehrels wasn't known to
me before this thread came up but the May issue of Scientific American
has an article about the Inconstant Cosmos with a photo of Neil
Gehrels project scientist for NASA's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
Same person

No I estimate a   probability the Gehrels referred to
is Thomas Gehrels of the Spacewatch project Kitt Peak observatory

Maybe in the th century they could do gamma ray spectroscopy on
distant asteroids with an orbiting observatory but here in the
primitive th we have to send a probe there to get gamma ray
spectroscopy done

 ETHER IMPLODES  EARTH CORE IS GRAVITY

  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary 
ether sucking structures AND why we observe orbital motion

  Ether the theoretical propogation media of electromagnetic 
waves was concluded not to exist based on the results of the 
MichelsonMoreley experiment conducted a century ago 

  I propose that those conclusions are flawed based on the fact 
that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the 
earth's surface not perpindicular Due to the prevailing assumption 
that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind

  The reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the 
development of modern scientific thought could have ramifications 
of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD

  REMEMBER Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge

  

  I dream like this ether based reality
 
  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality Creations 
start as a lattice placed into the ether Given a spin the lattices
both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it 
converting it distilling localized mass time and energy 
nonspinning lattice  dark matter

  The earth isn't exactly spinning around the sun Picture an image 
of a galaxy we haven't any videos of them spinning Picture us 
being stationary and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by 
the spinning ether field Picture an onion each layer of which is 
spinning a little faster than the next A thread shot at the inner 
kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways its head being in a 
faster shell than its tail until it finally intersected the ground 
of the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but 
its foot print being a line not a point sunrise sunset
  
  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us It is a parasite non self 
spin sustaining  being dragged in the earth's ether field which is 
itself in the sun's much more powerful field Our seasons are the 
wobble of earth's axis like a top slowing down The orbit of the
earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around
by the sun's ether feild

  The earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance 
apart Its just that the time between them varies greatly because 
the path is not the same The moon's lattice in the ether is like 
sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half 
turn The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has 
got the whole plate of noodles wound up The piece of light going to 
the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at 
the end The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the 
whole plate like a needle in a record before it gets there 

  With a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon 
can be about as big as earth's shadow upon it and at other times 
totally eclipse the sun Look in the sky except for your Knowledge 
would you guess that they are about the same size just because they 
look about the same size

   O                        E     O   O   O   S
 E                        
    M                OR                M    
                                     
       S                           
       
  The full moon quarter moon etc is the difference between rate
of ether spins What we are looking at is a rotating turntable view 
of the moon only half of which is facing the sun  I've seen a 
half moon within about  degrees of sky of the sun during the 
day Try and draw that earth shadow Its only the moon's image 
which appears to orbit us No matter where it is the light part is 
the part facing the sun and the dark part is the half facing away 
from the sun even when it appears to be behind us

  LightYears between galaxies is a misnomer The distance is 
closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics of this phase 
of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion 
defining edge   ether spin What we are seeing could be 
essentially happening now The piece of light may have experienced 
many years but the trip could be very quick our time

  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to 
despin myself phase out my mass Good luck trying to design 
a propulsion system to drag around a spacetime locality its like 
trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within

  To find out about all of this I recommend studying history I'd 
look in the book of life or holy grail etc Brain waves just 
might carry decipherable data I'd start looking on some part of the 
spectra said to be unusable due to all the background noise  
billion humans I'd totally isolate myself record me thinking DOG 
backwards and learn to read what I got Microsoft Holy Grail card 
for Pentium

  Next concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non timebound 
media the ether and that it is I who move forward in time I 
would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow of time which 
I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism pole to pole 
Why not perhaps by passing a LARGE FLAT DC current through a 
two foot diameter coil or choke or something and seeing what I 
could get with my machine's receiver next to it  

  If you don't think you'll live to see it consider this QUIT 
PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY All of 
life's data could be written on the wind ether not just our 
thoughts DNA could be a little receiver or file access code By 
eating SEEDS we could be jamming our reception or receiving plant 
instructions Try eating seed bearing fruit Maybe those Greek or 
biblical guys did live hundreds of years I'm curios to see what 
they did and ate Don't worry if your hair stops growing Maybe we 
don't need to eat at all the cosmos are formed from nothing and 
that is creating matter I only need enough to bounce around Where 
did the household concept 'immortal' come from Wheat is a weed it 
is programmed to pull from the soil reproduce like hell and then 
die

  Warning about writing to the past
I had a little dream of being in a world in the near parallel 
future lying along a path of history which we have diverged from 
There were twelve telepathic glowing beings who looked like an 
Oscar award and who had always been a dark one who looked like us 
and then myself The dark one was in the process of making the 
others into gods he had to teach them what that meant by 
advising them in their past Basically he manipulated them into 
reproducing and raising their children on his seed He said that 
the little ones who looked different were a subspecies meant to 
provide service He carefully combed through history rewriting it 
in his favor pulling like a weed anything that compromised his 
control He enticed recruits by sending them his visions saying 
that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve 
souls kill or be killed The amount of control he could exert was 
finite though as at every change he made a void would appear in 
our reality The universe one day ended  meters from us it 
seemed odd but we couldn't remember how else it should be Then 
some of the twelve were no more Finally when he could prune no 
more and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips he stepped 
through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that 
he had created I made a few more changes and lost my body 
existing only on the wind 

  MORAL Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls 
whose will's are not in harmony with yours Golden Rule  treat 
others as you wish to be treated IE you could end up along a 
lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brownnosers for 
playmates its not eternal there's more than one way back 

 Accepting rides to the past
Once here the one who looks like us sells rides he can make you a 
Prince or a Queen or you can live as a god in ancient Greece Go 
ahead repeat the third grade as often as you like Adam henry 
I Hope you like inspecting your socks Careful though if he likes 
your work but thinks you're getting wise he can direct you to cross 
paths with your old self and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own 
course of history none the wiser

  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped 
back in time his hierarchy will lose its direction He can still 
make changes while he's here its just that that is work and with 
every 'adjustment' this becomes less the world he cultivated which 
loosens his grip and his organization is suddenly one branch less 
But he can't see the change The basic nature of man is good He had 
to apply his hand to achieve his world As he now tightens his hand 
to retain what he built the more sand slips through his fingers 

  How about public computer access to the IRS  Its our country 
our money and they're spending it on us RIGHT Imagine this 
Washington marks the next cost at  IRS collects  gives  to 
congress and just absolutely buries  Congress borrows  The banks 
are making what a  margin interest on our government Big 
corporations are ecstatic if they can do a  margin What do the 
banks do with it Hold some on a carrot to the world sure but 
mostly bury it WHY Food production is  GNP construction    
hours to build your auto  The people are spending all of their time 
to buy back a tenth of what they produce Have we been deceived If 
we are more efficient why is it getting harder to get by What if 
the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets 

  In that other reality I shouted to the twelve its chaos They 
said no its order He defined chaos as that which is he was not 
able to control

  Rain forest The problem could be that all the water in its canopy 
would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no 
language telepathic and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death
think of the spine as a transceiver if it is on the ground and 
pointed up you can locate it from above These people are probably 
naive as children but very very tough to kill Also They should 
be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about 
They can hear him I think that Ham and world band radio old timers 
might have a story to tell on this These people would be on a 
different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds

  Famine relief When I make my diet almost all whole wheat I get a 
huge belly lose muscle mass sleep A LOT and get sick When I eat 
only fresh fruit I get more energy a Hollywoodflat belly and 
need a lot less sleep

  UN Peace Keeping There is fighting and killing all over The 
troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf its OK to kill 
each other just make sure there is enough to eat

  Somalia What is disturbing is energetic gun carrying three foot 
tall sixteen yearolds who eat nothing but some roots that they 
suck on It is not so much that their growth is stunted it is that 
they aren't dying at a rate of  of  years per life 

  Women with children Babes in arms Historical references to women 
and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut 
from the umbilical cord and hence were not breast fed I think 
that there may be some very interesting results to this such as 
motherchild telepathy and blue blooded infants There are examples 
of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate

  That guy is the master of illusion and the ultimate liar He 
tells it first and then just follows the thread of time in which 
the people are willing to buy it in which he can make it so He'll 
play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered and then he'll 
whine beg and grovel All it means to him is that you're willing to 
live on the ground work that he has laid that is that he was 
right and he didn't over play his hand and he won't need to go 
back and try another thread of time You have ultimate control over 
your destiny just don't live along a path that leads to a reality 
in which you don't want to be a part of 

  I don't claim to be the first to think these things its just 
that the others could have been 'pruned' from our path Maybe these 
thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time after him

 Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral
 exploration
 
 Basically get the ecifreaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth
 You think this is crazy Well in a way it is but in a way it is reality
 
 There is a billin the congress to do just that Basically to make it so
 expensive to mine minerals in the US unless you can by off the inspectors or
 tax collectors ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends 
 of mine that they the congress propose to have a tax on the gross income of
 the mine versus the adjusted income also the state governments have there
 normal taxes So by the time you get done paying for materials workers and
 other expenses you can owe more than what you made
 BAsically if you make a  and spend  ofor expenses you can owe
  in federal taxes Bascially it is driving the miners off the land And
 the only peopel who benefit are the ecofreaks 
 
 Basically to get back to my beginning statement is space is the way to go
 cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the
 ecofreaks or the protectionist 
 Such fun we have in these interesting times
 
 
 Michael Adams nsmcaacadalaskaedu  I'm not high just jacked

The current mining regulations and fees were set in the 's
What the socalled ecofreaks want to do is to simply bring those
fees in line with current economic reality  Currently mining companies
can get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices 
something like   The mining lobby has for decades managed to block
any reform of these outdated fees  In fact the latest attempt to reform
them was again blocked  President Clinton compromised by taking the
mining fee reforms out of his ' budget and plans to draft separate
legislation to fight that battle
If you want to discuss this further I suggest you take this to talkenvironment

 So how much would it cost as a private venture assuming you could talk the
 US government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida 

Why must it be a US Government Space Launch Pad Directly I mean

In fact you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a
project  The pricetag is invariably too high either in money or in
hassles

The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to
the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit  Everything else is practically
down in the noise  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any
new problems beyond what you face in low orbit is the last km 
the actual landing  and that is not immensely difficult  Of course
you can spend sagadollars saga is the metric prefix for beelyuns
and beelyuns on things other than the launches but you don't have to

The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply for
more than a brief visit at least is lowcost transport to Earth orbit
For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs you can develop
a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper  Delta Clipper
might be a bit more expensive than this perhaps but there are less
ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit  Any plan for doing
sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting
money in a big way

Given this questions like whose launch facilities you use are not a
minor detail they are very important to the cost of the launches which
dominates the cost of the project

This sounds a bit high to me  Still higher accelerations have been endured
very briefly during violent deceleration  If we're talking sustained
acceleration I think odd gees has been demonstrated using water immersion

I doubt that any of this generalizes to another order of magnitude

A related question which I haven't given that much serious thought 
to at what lattitude is the average length of the day averaged 
over the whole year maximized Is this function a constant
 hours Is it truly symmetric about the equator Or is
there some discrepancy due to the fact that the orbit is elliptic
or maybe the difference is enough to change the temperature and
make the seasons in the southern hemisphere more bitter but
is far too small to make a sizeable difference in daylight
hours

I want to know where to move

Hello I am looking for a program or algorithm that can be used
to compute sunrise and sunset times

Here is a computation I did a long time ago that computes the length
of the daylight  You should be able to convert the information here
to sunrise and sunset times

Definitions

z  the tilt of the axis of the planet away from the normal to its
orbital plane  In case of the Earth z is about  degrees I think
I do not recall the exact value  In case of Uranus z is almost
 degrees

u  latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured
Paris is at about  degrees  North pole is at 

a  angular position of the planet around the sun  As a goes from
 to  degrees the planet makes a full circle around the sun
The spring equinox occurs at a

L  daylight fraction  duration of daylightduration of a full day
On the equator u L is always   Near the north pole u degrees
L is sometimes one and sometimes zero depending on the time of the year

Computation
Define the auxiliary angles p and q by
sin p  sin a sin z
cos q  h  tan u tan p          q   degrees

Conclusion
L  q     if q is measured in degrees
L  q  pi    if q is measured in radians

Wait  But what is h
The cutoff function h is defined as follows

h s  s    if  s  
           if   s  
          if   s  

As an interesting exercise plot L versus a   The graph will shows
how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year
Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles
Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below

I heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in
that essentially says If you never hear from Earth again
here's what to do  This was a back up in the event a receiver
burnt out but the probe could still send data limited but
still some data  


Voyager  has the unusual  luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the
solar system   All it's doing is collecting  fields  data  and routinely
squirting it down  One of the mariners is also in stable
solar orbit  and still providing similiar  solar data  

Something  in a planetary orbit  is subject to much more complex forces

Comsats in stable  geosynch  orbits  require  almost daily
stationkeeping operations   

For the occasional  deep space bird  like PFF  after pluto  sure
it could be left on  autopilot  but things like  galileo or
magellan  i'd suspect they need enough  housekeeping that
even untended they'd  end up unusable after a while

The better question  should be

Why not transfer  OM of all birds to a separate agency with continous funding
to support these kind of ongoing science missions

pat

	When ongoing ops are mentioned  it seems to  always quote  Operations
and Data analysis  how much would it cost to collect the data
and let it be analyzed  whenever  kinda like all that landsat data
that sat around for  years before someone analyzed it for the ozone hole

Even if you let teh bird drift  it may  get hosed by some
cosmic phenomena   

Since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for
startup if some type of cosmic BEM took out the probe it might
not be such a big loss  Obviously you can't plan for
everything but the most obvious things can be considered

I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that 
every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it
replaced  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products
then available   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon  Multiprocessors
were slower then  existent single processors

What the argument was though was that these new technologies promised either
theoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities

I think that the DC  may gfit into this same model

ELV's can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT  but 
an SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs

This is kind of a speculative posting  but I thought i'd throw it out as
a hjistorical framework  for those interested in the project

   As for advertising  sure why not  A NASA friend and I spent one

Hmmm It actually isn't all that much is it Like about  million

per burger that said organization sold last year You'd be best off
with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an
unmanned craft in lunar orbit or rather a large set of such craft
If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new

You might have to abandon the colour though

Buy a cheap launch system design reusable moon  lunar orbit

Can we get the fastfood chain bidding against the fizzydrink

Would they buy it given that it's a lot more expensive and not
much more impressive than putting a large set of severalkm

should be composed by rocks and ices

	Can someone confirm these information Could this object be a

Press Release No
Paris  April 

Users of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome of
their experiments

Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would not
be blossoming as it now does had OLYMPUS not provided
a testbed for the technologies and services of the s This
summarises the general conclusions of  speakers and 
participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in
Seville on April  The conference was organised by
the European Space Agency ESA and the Spanish Centre for
the Development of Industrial Technology CDTI

OLYMPUS has been particularly useful 
      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of
       new users thanks to satellite terminals with very small
       antennas VSATs OLYMPUS experiments have tested
       data transmission videoconferencing business television
       distance teaching and rural telephony to give but a few
       examples

      in opening the door to new telecommunications services
       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower
       frequency bands OLYMPUS was the first satellite over
       Europe to offer capacity in the  GHz band

      in establishing twoway data relay links  OLYMPUS
       received for the first time in Europe over several months
       highvolume data from a lowEarth orbiting spacecraft and
       then distributed it to various centres in Europe

When OLYMPUS was launched on  July  it was the
world's largest telecommunications satellite and no other
satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four
different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands

OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some
of the world's largest businesses Access to the satellite is
given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or
services over the past four years some  companies and
organisations made use of this opportunity as well as over
 members of the EUROSTEP distancelearning
organisation



As the new technologies and services tested by these
OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market they then
make use of operational satellites such as those of
EUTELSAT

OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through  and 
when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the
end of its design life

DFW was designed with the STS in mind which really mean very little  Much of
their early PR material had scenes with a shuttle landing and two or three
others pulled up to gates  I guess they were trying to stress how advanced the
airport was

For Dallas types  Imagine the fit Grapevine and Irving would be having if the

Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a ProtonCentaur combo
What would be the benefits and problems with such a combo other

I haven't seen any speculation about it But the Salyut KB Design Bureau 
was planning a new LHLOX second stage for the Proton which would boost
payload to LEO from about  to  kg Geostationary goes from
 kg Gals launcher version to  kg This scheme was competing
with the EnergiaM last year and I haven't heard which won except now
I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the 
successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the EnergiaM So the early
results are EnergiaM won but this is a guess nothing is very clear in 
Russia I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue 
their development 

The Centaur for the Altas is about  meters dia and the Proton 
is  so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage the BlockD
which sets inside a shround just under  meters dia I don't know about
launch loads etc but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which
are probably worse than the Proton those Titan SRB's probably shake things
up pretty good it seems feasible EXCEPT the Centaur is a very fragile
thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now
Protons are assembled and transported horizontially Does anyone know 
how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while
bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track
and erected on the pad  

They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads 
unless the new Proton second stage is actually built and of course
any Centaur support systems and facilities no doubt imported from the
US at great cost These systems may viloate US law so there are political
problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention

Seriously though If you were to ask the British government
whether their colonisation efforts in the Americas were cost
effective what answer do you think you'd get What if you asked
in     and  respectively 

What do you mean Are you saying they thought the effort was
profitable or that the money was efficiently spent providing max
value per money spent

I think they would answer yes on ballance to both questions Exceptions
would be places like the US from the French Indian War to the end of
the US Revolution 

But even after the colonies revolted or where given independance the
British engaged in very lucrative trading with the former colonies
Five years after the American Revolution England was still the largest
US trading partner

The balloons were in sufficiently low orbit that they experienced
some air resistance  When they were finally punctured this 
preasure and the internal preasure that was needed to maintain
a spherical shape against this resistance caused them to
catastrophically deflated  The large silvered shards

transfer vehicle you could send a lot more Either way its a lot
more than needed

This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO but it is
enough to do it if the vehicle exists

But Allen if you can assume the existence of an SSTO there is no need
to have the contest in the first place  I would think that what we
want to get out of the contest is the development of some of these
'cheaper' ways of doing things if they already exist why flush G

This was what the Shuttle was originally intended to do It might be seriously

A couple of points on this thread

 We have been using our processes since way before Challenger  Challenger
   in and of it self did not uncover flaws

 What Mr Spencer says is by and large true  We have a process that is
   not dependent on sophisticated tools  CASE tools  However tools
   cannot fix a bad process  Also tool support for HALS the Shuttle
   Language is somewhat limited

 The Onboard Flight Software project was rated Level  by a NASA team

This is a common misconception  There was nothing off the wall
about the Wright Brothers  They were in correspondance with a number
of other experimenters Octave Chanute Lillienthal etc they flew
models they had a wind tunnel  In short they were quite mainstream
and were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community

I suggest you read The Bishop's Boys or the biography by Harry Gates
Combs  I can never remember which it isthe guy that had the FBOs
and owned Learjet for a while  These are both in print and easily

Even better would be the multivolume set of the Wrights' writings

  The commercial uses of a transportation system between alreadysettled

The correct analogy is not with aviation of the ''s but the long
transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery
 Lindbergh's flight took place in ' not the thirties
 
  Of course sorry for the misunderstanding  I was referring to the fact
that far more aeronautical development took place in the ''s  For much
of the ''s the superabundance of Jennies and OX engines held down the
industry  By  many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired
and Whirlwind had their powerweight ratio and reliability up to the point
where longdistance flights became practical  It's important to note that
the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in   Lindbergh
Chamberlin and Levine and Byrd's America  When it's time to railroad
you railroad

It didn't require gov't to fund these as long as something was known about
the potential for profit at the destination  In practice some were gov't
funded some were private
Could you give examples of privately funded ones

  Not off the top of my head I'll have to dig out my reference books again
However I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the
Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and
merchants to put up the rest  They profits from the voyage would then be
shared

But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount
of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff
A person who puts up X billion for a moon base is much more likely to do
it because they want to see it done than because they expect to make money
off the deal

  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a
Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations
can even consider putting up  The Kremer Prizes human powered aircraft
Orteig's prize Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic won in
 by Alcock and Brown were MUCH smaller  The technologies required were
within the reach of individual inventors and the prize amounts were well
within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals  I think that only
a gov't could afford to set up a B prize for any purpose whatsoever

taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane

 The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply for
 more than a brief visit at least is lowcost transport to Earth orbit
 For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs you can develop
 a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper  Delta Clipper
 might be a bit more expensive than this perhaps but there are less
 ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit  

Ah there's the rub  And a catch to boot  For the purposes of a
contest you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get
there  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable without
demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system  Course if a
low priced system existed there might be demand  

I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage
low cost payload delivery systems  The accounting methods would probably
be the hardest to work out  For example would you allow Rockwell to
'loan' you the engines  And so forth

 Any plan for doing
 sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting
 money in a big way
 

This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line  In other
words perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology life support
navigation etc could be developed prior to a low cost launch system 
You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever but I'd hate to see
folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac oops I mean launch
system comes on line

I guess I'd simplify this to say that 'waste' is a slippery concept  If
your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next  years then perhaps its
not 'wasted' money  If your goal is to explore the moon for under 
million then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so

The question i have about the proton is  could it be  handled at

handled at kourou  or Vandenberg   

Seems like a lot of trouble to go to Its probably better to   
invest in newer launch systems I don't think a big cost advantage
for using Russian systems will last for very long maybe a few years 
Lockheed would be the place to ask since you would probably have to buy 
the Proton from them they market the Proton world wide except Russia 
They should know a lot about the possibilities I haven't heard them
propose US launches so I assume they looked into it and found it 
unprofitable 

Now if it uses storables  

Yes

then  how long would it take for the russians
to equip something at cape york

Comparable to the Zenit I suppose but since it looks like
nothing will be built there you might just as well pick any
spot

The message is to launch now while its cheap and while Russia and
Kazakstan are still cooperating Later the story may be different

Well I guess I'm left wondering just who all the 'light fascists'
think they are  Yes I understand the issues  I don't even
particularly care for the idea  But am I the only one that finds the
sort of overreaction above just a little questionable  You must
find things like the Moon really obnoxious in their pollution

A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves

	 How long is this thing supposed to stay up  Sounds like it
would have a huge drag area not a lot of mass and be in a fairly
low orbit

	 Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here
What real impact are we talking about really  How many optical
astronomers are really going to be impacted

	 Which is more important adding a few extra days of
'seeing' for very few optical astronomers or getting the data the
sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large
inflatables and the potential there for an inflatable space station
The choice would seem to be one or the other since the advertising is
being used to help fund this thing

	 If your answer to  above was the astronomers then feel
free to come up with some other way to fund the to my mind more
important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING
ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT  In other words put up or shut up

I guess we really
deserve being wiped out by uv radiation folks Stupidity wins I
guess that's true and if only by pure numbers

Probably so  I'm just not sure we agree about who the 'stupid' are

SPACECRAFT

  On April  cruise science Memory Readouts MROs were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV Dust Detector DDS and Magnetometer
MAG instruments  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly

  On April  a Command Detector Unit SignaltoNoise Ratio CDUSNR test
and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control RFSAGC test were
performed using the LGA Low Gain Antenna  over DSS Madrid  meter
antenna and DSS Madrid  meter antenna respectively  Data analysis
is in process  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed
information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity

  On April  a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
 hours its planned value during this mission phase

  On April  the first of two suppressed carrierDSN Deep Space Network
advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS Goldstone
 meter antenna  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from  degrees
to  degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings

  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change
greater than  DN throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance
measurement has  The AC measurement reads  DN  volts  The DC
measurement has ranged from  DN  volts to  DN  volts and
currently reads  DN  volts  These measurements are consistent with
the model developed by the ACDC special anomaly team

  The Spacecraft status as of April   is as follows

       a  System Power Margin    watts
       b  Spin Configuration  DualSpin
       c  Spin RateSensor  rpmStar Scanner
       d  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately  degrees

WHAT'S NEW in my opinion Friday  April   Washington DC

Now Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a milelong inflatable billboard in lowearth
orbit

This sounds like something Lowell Wood would think of  Does anyone
know if he's involved

No  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible
nearterm commercial space activities  One of the folks involved in those
discussions a
spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter passed the suggestion on to 
some entreprenurial types and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with
it  Preston is now at LLNL and is working with Space Marketing on 
the sensors that might be carried

NASA would provide contractual launch services However
since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
WN  Mar  the taxpayers would bear most of the expense 

Actually that sounds unlikely  I don't know what the launch vehicle
would be but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher 
certainly not on the Shuttle  and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA
for eg  launch support would probably 
cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well

This
may look like environmental vandalism but Mike Lawson CEO of
Space Marketing told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment The platform will carry ozone
monitors he explainedadvertising is just to help defray costs

This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people  My
guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to
build large inflatable space structures

No as noted LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design per 
Clementine and related programs  I'm sure folks around here would like to 
see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure but after all 
the US did the Echo satellites long ago and an advertising structure
would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was
or a parade balloon for that matter


What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky It is not even April  anymore

While I happen to personally dislike the idea mostly because I've got
a background in astronomy it's hardly vandalism  it would be a shortlived
intrusion on the night sky doing no permanent damage and actually hurting
only a small subset of astronomers  On the other hand it would certainly
draw attention to space   

If this is true I think it's a great idea

Learning how to build structures in space in an essential
step towards space development

Which unfortunately this is not likely to contribute much to

If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates
creative use of partial private sector funding in the process  so
much the better

Is NASA really supporting this junk

As far as I know it's a purely commercial venture

And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
news blip  How serious is this project  Is this just in the wild
idea stage or does it have real funding

I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers
Commercial projects however generally don't get funding  they
get customers  whether it will have customers remains to be seen

Are protesting groups being organized in the States

Not yet  Though if this project goes through I suppose The Return
of Jeremy Rifkin is inevitable

Nahh  He's too busy watching for mutant bacteria to notice anything in
the sky

How could this possibly be environmental vandalism when there is no
environment to vandalize up there

Since the advertising is just to help defray costs it's certainly no
surprise that the taxpayers would bear most of the expense  Sounds
like a good idea to me since the taxpayers would bear all of the
expense if they didn't do the advertising

What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky

Great idea they should have done it long ago

What about light pollution in observations I read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day leave alone at night

I can't believe that a milelong billboard would have any significant
effect on the overall sky brightness  Venus is visible during the day
but nobody complains about that  Besides it's in LEO so it would only
be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright and even if
it would have some miniscule impact it would be only for a short time
as it goes zipping across the sky

Are protesting groups being organized in the States

No doubt  People are always looking for something to protest about so
it would be no surprise

Really really depressed

Well look on the er bright side  Imagine the looks on the faces of
people in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up
and see a can of Budweiser flying across the sky D

pbdrunyoncimcdccom Paul Dokas writes

I was reading Popular Science this morning and was surprised by an ad in
the back  I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe
science or questionablely legal but this one really grabbed my attention
It was from a company name Personal Missle Inc or something like that

The company was probably Public Missiles Inc of Michigan

Anyhow the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to ' in length
and engines of sizes F to M  They also said that some rockets will
reach  feet

Yup

Now aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one
of these beasts isn't this illegal  I can't imagine the FAA allowing
people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes
Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down

Nope it's not illegal It is however closely regulated In order to 
purchase and use the big rocket motors required it is necessary to be
one of the following
a An employee of a government agency
b An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets
c A member or representative of an educational organization involved in
research or other uses of rockets There are two such organizations 
The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry
Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction
and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own

The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations upon request to any 
organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions 
to avoid conflicts with aircraft The usual stipulations are
 Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed Depending on the
location this ceiling may be from  to  feet AGL 
 The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft
within the operating radius around the launch site
 Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited
 The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that
unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time

Most of the launches that are held and there are dozens of them every year
are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light such as over the
western deserts the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular
since it is  x  miles of nothing to hit on the ground

The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'
use to insure safety Depending on motor size the launcher setback is
from  to  or more feet 

By the way rockets under  lb and powered by an F motor are exempt from
most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway See FAR  Subpart
C for details

As for recoveryalthough the higher altitude rockets can reach up to
 feet most of them only get to  to  feet The typical
rocket is  to  inches in diameter and carries a  to  foot parachute
or multiple parachutes depending on the payload Many rockets also carry
either a small transmitter or an audio sounderparticularly at launches
in the eastern US where there are more obstructions

Camera telemetry transmitter and video payloads are becoming quite common

And no I'm not going to even think of buying one  I'm not that crazy

Why not It's a lot of funcheck out the traffic on recmodelsrockets
for information about the model  lb and under and high power everything
bigger rocket hobbies As with all dangerous activities the key is to
practice safety I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to  lbs
takeoff weight for  years and still have all my extremities intact

Paul mine'll do  feet and carries  pounds of dynamite Dokas

That's another thing NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE
ROCKETS NONE Please forgive me for shouting but that's one of the biggest
misconceptions people have about our hobby 

            Just remember you WILL die someday             
True But it will not be related to the rocket hobby unless I get 
hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand

lower costs as a specific objective then you probably don't want to
build something HLVsized anyway

Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans  It
doesn't take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large

Ah there's the rub  And a catch to boot  For the purposes of a
contest you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get
there  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable without
demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system

You're assuming that the lowcost delivery system has to be a separate
project  But why  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
in hopes of winning a billiondollar prize it is cheaper to develop
your own launch system charging its entire development cost against
your contest entry than to try to do it with existing launchers  No
other demand is necessary

 Any plan for doing
 sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting
 money in a big way

This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line  In other
words perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology life support
navigation etc could be developed prior to a low cost launch system 
You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever but I'd hate to see
folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac oops I mean launch
system comes on line

You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch
system  But why  The Saturn V took less than six years depending on
exactly when you date its start  Pegasus took about three from project
start to first flight  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development
the target date for an orbital DCY flight was   If you really want
speed consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile still in
service as the core of the Delta launcher shipped to the USAF less
than  months after the development goahead

One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief
that you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending
billions of dollars  It isn't true and never was

was essentially nothing in common between these three programs

Yes three programs  Despite the similarity of names Titan I and

same fuels never mind the same launch facilities

Sorry the Titan silos a can't handle the Titan launchers with their

violations of normal rangesafety rules nobody cares about such things
in the event of a nuclear war but in peacetime they matter and c were

Hello I am looking for a program or algorithm that can be used
to compute sunrise and sunset times

Here is a computation I did a long time ago that computes the length
of the daylight  You should be able to convert the information here
to sunrise and sunset times

Sorry not so  the changes in sunrise and sunset times are not
quite synchronized  For example neither the earliest sunrise nor the
latest sunset comes on the longest day of the year

You can derive day length from sunrise and sunset times but not
viceversa

   Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such
   Why not

Because to be any use as a nav point you need to know exactly where
it is which means you either nail it to something that doesn't move
or you watch it all the time  Neither of which is possible on a
deactivated spacecraft  Then you have to know exactly how far away
from it you are this may or may not be possible with the hardware on
board 

Apart from which there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons

Besides the mechanical problems of moving so dense a medium in oan out
of the lungs diaphragm fatigue etc is there likely to be a problem
with the mixture  I mean since the lungs never expel all the air in
them the inhaled air has to mix pretty quickly with the residual air in
the lungs to provide a useful partial pressure of oxygen right  Would
this mixing be substantially fasterslower at the pressures we're
talking about

  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago
about breathing liquid It was a few months before The Abyss came out
As far as I can remember they mentioned three things that were difficult
to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid
   low viscosity  if it's too difficult to force the fluid in  out 
    of the lungs you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own
    breathing effort let alone anything else

   diffusion rate  obviously not all the air in your lungs is
    expelled when you breathe out and the part that isn't expelled
    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli alveolus
    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done
    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid Apparently oxygen
    tends to diffuse more readily than CO so even if you can get enough
    oxygen in you might not be able to get enough CO out

   oxygenCO capacity  you have to be able to dissolve enough
    gas per unit volume 

  Oh and of course your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs
or interfere with their healing or anything like that

 In my first posting on this subject I threw out an idea of how to fund
 such a contest without delving to deep into the budget  I mentioned
 granting mineral rights to the winner my actual wording was mining
 rights  Somebody pointed out quite correctly that such rights are
 not anybody's to grant although I imagine it would be a fait accompli
 situation for the winner  So how about this  Give the winning group
 I can't see one company or corp doing it a   or  year
 moratorium on taxes
 
 Tom Freebairn 


Who says there is no mineral rights to be given Who says The UN or the US
Government 
Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars who will stop you
The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie Can the truly inforce it

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation who will
stop you from doing it Maybe not acknowledge you 

Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great
beyond of space what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is
not Maybe I am a few years ahead on this It is liek the old Catholic Church 
stating which was Portugals and what was Spains and along came the Reformation
and made it all null and void 

What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged and offer your
services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroidsmarsmoon or what
ever As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble
Basically find a country who wants to go into space but can't for soem reason
or another but who will give you a home Such as Saudia Arabia or
whatever
There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN got to them and
offer your services and such I know that sound crazy but is it
Also once you have the means to mine the moon or whatever then just do it
The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else they will
not care 
If your worried about the US do the same thing

Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth After all they have many
other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what
ever
Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a
little bit farther out to do jus ta  little bit more and to tell the crown to
piss off If my ancestors thought the way many today think Id have been born
in Central Europe just north of the Black Sea

I just read a good book Tower of the Gods Interesting

 pat

I aint talking the large or even the mining companies I am talking the small
miners the people who have themselves and a few employees if at allThe
people who go out every year and set up thier sluice box and such and do
mining the semiold fashion way okay they use modern methods toa point

I am talking the guy who coem to Nome evry year sets up his tent on the beach
the beach was washed away last year and sets up hisher sluice box and goes
at it mining
I know the large corps such as Alaska Gold Company might complain to

My opinions are what I learn at the local BS table

My original thingidea was that the way to get space mining was to allow the
ecofreaks thier way As they have done with other mineral development
You can't in many places can't go to the bathroom in the woods without some

Seems that the MileLong Billboard and any other inflateble space
objectstation or what ever have the same problems other than being a little
bit different than the normal space ideas such as trusses and shuttles

But also dag and such Why not combine the discussion of how and fesibility to
the same topic

I personnelly liek the idea of a billboard in space But problem How do you
service it fly a shuttleDC to near it and then dismount and fly to it
Or what or havign a special docking section for shuttleDC docking

Also what if the billboard springs a leak Self sealing and such


Just thinking okay rambling

Also why must the now inflated billboard not be covered in the inside by a
harder substance such as a polymer or other agent and then the now hard
billboard would be a now giant docking structurespace dockstation

Or am I missing something here probably am

Are breathable liquids possible

I remember seeing an old Nova or The Nature of Things where this idea was
touched upon it might have been some other TV show  If nothing else I know
such liquids ARE possible because

They showed a large glass full of this liquid and put a white mouse rat in
it  Since the liquid was not dense the mouse would float so it was held down
by tongs clutching its tail  The thing struggled quite a bit but it was
certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid  It never
did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top

Now this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations but it certainly
shows breathable liquids can be made

Who says there is no mineral rights to be given Who says The UN or the US

Tom's right about this  It's only a grantable right if the granter has
the will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you
Never mind the legal status

Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars who will stop you
The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie Can the truly inforce it

Nick's right about this  It's always easier to obtain forgiveness than
permission  Not many people remember that Britain's King George III
expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghanyappalachian
mountains  Said subjects basically said Stop us if you can  He
couldn't

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation who will
stop you from doing it Maybe not acknowledge you 

That's how the USA started  Of course that's also how the Bolivarian
Republic started ca  in central america  It didn't have
quite the staying power of the USA  I'm sure there are more examples of
going far away and then ignoring authority but none jump to mind right
now

What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged and offer your
services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroidsmarsmoon or what
ever As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble

Or do as some whaling nations do define whatever activities you want to
carry out as scientific research which just coincidentally requires
the recovery of megatonnes of minerals or whatever then go at it

Basically find a country who wants to go into space but can't for soem reason
or another but who will give you a home Such as Saudia Arabia or
whatever

Lute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya I think in
the late ''s for his commercial space launch project one of the very
earliest  It was killed by Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise
missiles in Africa which made Libya renege on the arrangement

Basically get the ecofreaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth

They aren't going to leave a loophole as glaring as space mining  Quite a
few of those people are when you come right down to it basically against
industrial civilization  They won't stop with shutting down the mines here
that is only a means to an end for them now

The worst thing you can say to a true revolutionary is that his revolution
is unnecessary that the problems can be corrected without radical change
Telling people that paradise can be attained without the revolution is
treason of the vilest kind

Trying to harness these people to support spaceflight is like trying to
harness a buffalo to pull your plough  He's got plenty of muscle all
right but the furrow will go where he wants not where you want

Since we don't have the money to keep them going now how will
changing them to a seperate agency help anything

How about transferring control to a nonprofit organisation that is
able to accept donations to keep craft operational

The problem is you can't raise adequate amounts of money that way
The Viking Fund tried  They did succeed in a way but only because
of the political impact of their fundraising  The actual amount of
money they raised was fairly inconsequential it would not have kept
the Viking lander going by itself

If I'm not mistaken this is the usual sort of precaution against loss of
communications  That timer is counting down continuously if it ever hits
zero that means Galileo hasn't heard from Earth in a suspiciously long
time and it may be Galileo's fault so it's time to go into a fallback
mode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances
of restoring contact  I don't know exactly whatall Galileo does in such
a situation but a common example is to switch receivers on the theory
that maybe the one you're listening with has died

If their parent company does business and they will on the face of the Earth
then they are vulnerable to govt sanctions  Yes they can be stopped

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation who will
stop you from doing it    

For the first    IMHO years nobody will have to  The colonists will
be too dependent on Earth too pull it off  Eventually they will history
shows us that

Also once you have the means to mine the moon or whatever then just do it 
The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else they will

INteresting question about Galileo

Galileo's HGA  is stuck   

The HGA was left closed  because galileo  had a venus flyby

If the HGA were pointed att he sun  near venus  it would
cook the foci elements

question  WHy couldn't Galileo's  course manuevers have been
designed such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point

After all  it would normally be aimed at earth anyway

or would it be that an emergency situation ie spacecraft safing
and seek might have caused an HGA sun point

RELEASE  

HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS

	The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS to
service the Hubble Space Telescope HST has been scheduled as an  day
mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability
for an additional two if needed

	The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities or EVAs was
reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training maneuver times
required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual
EVA tasks on previous missions

	Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is
to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the
dynamics or unknowns of spacewalks Mission Director Randy Brinkley said
It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added
flexibility and adaptability for reacting to realtime situations

	In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the
spacewalks officials have determined that changing out the gyros solar arrays
and the Wide FieldPlanetary Camera WFPC and installing the Corrective
Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement COSTAR are priority objectives
during the mission

	When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks highest through
lowest priority and recognizing that the major tasks  gyros solar arrays
WFPC and COSTAR  would consume most of the time set aside for each
spacewalk five EVAs were deemed appropriate said Milt Heflin Lead Flight
Director for the mission

	While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented the use of two
alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than
previous missions requiring two three or four EVAs

	We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous
spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs
Heflin said  In planning for all Space Shuttle missions it is necessary to
formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible
to accomplish the mission objectives

	Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions
that include support from the Mission Control Center called joint integrated
simulations lasting between  and  hours  In addition many stand alone
underwater training runs will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk

	Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be
made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the
mission  Also lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight
will be valuable in assisting the STS crew in its training techniques

	Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include
spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission
The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the
actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at
the Johnson Space Center Houston and the Marshall Space Flight Center
Huntsville Ala

	Also the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining
further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the
experience levels among the astronaut corps the flight controllers and
trainers

	Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew Hubble was built with
grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures

	The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April   At that
time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in
 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have
become necessary

The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says
it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving
commands  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer I believe the
probe starts a 'search for Earth' sequence involving antenna pointing
and attitude changes which consume fuel to try to reestablish
communications  Noops are sent periodically through those periods
when there are no real commands to be sent just so the probe knows
that we haven't forgotten about it

Hope that's clear enough to be comprehensible

What about light pollution in observations I read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day leave alone at night

I can't believe that a milelong billboard would have any significant
effect on the overall sky brightness  Venus is visible during the day
but nobody complains about that  Besides it's in LEO so it would only

When I was at the Texas Star Party a few years ago the sky was so dark
that Venus did indeed cause light pollution until it set

Even if the billboard were dark it could cause a problem  Imagine observing an
object and halfway through your run your object was occulted

I would guess that most of the people stating positive opinions are not 
fanatically serious observers

It is so typical that the rights of the minority are extinguished by the

SIRTF is still very much in business

By Mark Whalen
     In these times of extratight NASA budgets the very
survival of a number of missions has been uncertain But thanks
to major design refinements implemented in recent months JPL's
Space Infrared Telescope Facility SIRTF  a major project
considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago  is alive
and well according to Project Scientist Michael Werner
     A lighter spacecraft revised orbit and shorter mission have
added up to a less expensive project with tremendous scientific
power and a bright future said Werner
     Designed as a followup to the highly successful Infrared
Astronomical Satellite IRAS and Cosmic Background Explorer
COBE missions SIRTF  a cryogenically cooled observatory for
infrared astronomy from space  is scheduled for launch in 
or  if plans proceed as scheduled
     IRAS' pioneering work in spacebased infrared astronomy 
years ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as never
before and revealed among other things  galaxies and 
comets It provided a sky survey  times more sensitive than
any previously available from groundbased observations COBE has
measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large
angular scales and revealed new facts about the early universe
     But to illuminate SIRTF's potential Jim Evans JPL's
manager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics PreProjects
recently said that the project is  to  million times more
capable than IRAS based on technological advances in infrared
detector arrays
     However despite the enormous strides in infrared
exploration SIRTF promised and the fact that it was cited as the
highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the s
by the National Academy of Sciences it took a diet or die
directive from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project
going according to Werner
     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF based on the key
factor in its new design The satellite will orbit the sun
instead of the Earth permitting the use of an Atlas rocket
launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan The
main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your
launch capability for boosting the payload  you don't have to
carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit Werner said
The other advantage to a solar orbit he said is that it's in a
better thermal environment away from the heat of the Earth
     Additional major changes in SIRTF's redesign include
shortening the mission from five to three years and building a
spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original
plan  Atlas SIRTF will weigh  kilograms  pounds
compared to Titan SIRTF's  kilograms  pounds
     All of that adds up to a less stressful launch
environment Werner said and a cost savings of more than 
million for the launch in addition to increased savings in the
design of the smaller less massive spacecraft
     Werner said SIRTF's redesign came as a result of Congress'
telling NASA you're trying to do too many things If you want us
to support SIRTF which is a good project develop a plan to see
how it fits into NASA's overall strategy
     Shortly thereafter SIRTF was named as NASA's highest
priority flagship scientific mission by the interdisciplinary
Space Sciences Advisory Committee in addition to the blessing
from the National Academy of Sciences
     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping
to keep the project alive SIRTF's major scientific contribution
always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector
arrays which will allow images to be developed tens of
thousands of times faster than before according to Evans
     Up until a couple of years ago Werner said all infrared
astronomy was done with single detectors  or very small arrays
of individually assembled detectors Since then the Department
of Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or
hundreds of thousands of detectors rather than just a few and
those are very well suited for use on SIRTF
     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget
pressures Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an
eye out for any technological spinoff
     On that question I think we have some things to say he
said because the detectors we're using are straight off various
military developments Also SIRTF will be built by the US
aerospace industry and it's a real technological and engineering
challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project
     SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community
Werner added but the revised threeyear mission puts a premium
on observing time We have to educate the user community and
develop a program that involves early surveys and quick
turnaround of the data
     Werner said the downsizing of the project required a
reduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF's three instruments 
the infrared spectrograph infrared array camera and multiband
imaging photometer However these reductions will only result in
losses of efficiency rather than capability he said
     The project hopes to start a Phase B activity in 
which will provide a detailed concept for development and design
Building the hardware would begin about two years later
     Projected cost estimates Evans said are  million
million
     I am very optimistic about SIRTF he said It will
provide a tremendous return for the investment
     Werner added that an additional benefit from the project
will be the enrichment of our intellectual and cultural
environment People on the street are very interested in
astronomy  black holes the possibility of life on other
planets the origin of the universe  and those are the kind of
questions SIRTF will help answer

Cosmologist Stephen Hawking tours Lab

By Karre Marino
     Some  years after his first visit to JPL Prof Stephen
Hawking Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge
University and author of A Brief History of Time returned to
the Lab April 
     On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr Moustafa Chahine
and Merle McKenzie manager of the International Affairs Office
Hawking visited a variety of facilities met with Lab Director
Dr Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers and
felt like royalty he said Hawking whose theories attempt to
explain the origin of distant galaxies black holes and alternate
dimensions wanted to revisit JPL he explained because while
I'm most interested in those things in space that are farther
away I know that here is where the first steps are taken
     Hawking who was accompanied by his family two graduate
students and his aides began the tour in von Karman Auditorium
as David Evans deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of
Flight Projects and Dr Arden Albee Mars Observer's project
scientist briefed him on current and past flight projects
     Voyager was pointed out to him with special attention paid

     Using a model of Mars Observer Albee spent several minutes
describing the project and the spacecraft's features In answer
to a question from Hawking Chahine described a proposed
dragfree satellite but confirmed that at this point it's only
a concept Chahine who had met Hawking at Caltech about five
years before described the professor as a living miracle of the
power of the brain He's miraculous and he has such a good sense
of humor
     The next stop a demonstration on scientific data
visualization in Section 's Digital Image Animation Lab
entertained and delighted the group as everyone donned goggles
to view D images of Mars Project Scientist Dr Eric De Jong
showed off the latest data  a comet that had only recently been
discovered in orbit close to Jupiter Hawking was curious about
its composition and as he was shown how images are developed he
asked several questions on their interpretation
     Norman Haynes ALD Office of Telecommunications and Data
Acquisition briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations
Facility and then Hawking spoke with Stone
     The day ended with two technical discussions of particular
interest to the professor Technical Group Leader Dr Frank
Estabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described
a threespacecraft gravity wave experiment currently under way
Then planetary astronomer Dr Richard Terrile explained the
philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection
     The Hawking party which had been visiting Southern
California for five weeks was headquartered at Caltech and
planned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab
tour Upon departing the Cambridgebased scientist promised
Chahine that he would return to JPL for another visit

Hello I am looking for a program or algorithm that can be used
to compute sunrise and sunset times

I would appreciate any advice

I once thought it would be easiest fitting a sine to the times But not
This gave  discrepancy of upto six minutes If you fit a sine series
you'll get a very good fit after just three or four terms though This
presumably has to do with the eccentricity of the Earths orbit

VLBI project meets with international space agencies

By Ed McNevin
     Members of JPL's Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry
VLBI project team recently concluded a weeklong series of
meetings with officials from Russia and Japan
     The meetings were part of Space VLBI Week held at JPL in
early March and were intended to maintain cooperation between
international space agencies participating in the development of
the US Space VLBI Project a recently approved JPL flight
project set for launch in 
     US Space VLBI will utilize two Earthorbiting spacecraft
 the Japanese VSOP VLBI Space Observing Program satellite
with its meter radio telescope and a Russian RADIOASTRON
meter satellite Both spacecraft will team up with
groundbased radio telescopes located around the world to create
a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio
telescope observing power by a factor of 
     Japan's VSOP satellite will use a limited sixhour orbit to
conduct imaging science while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft
will exploit a larger hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory
radio astronomy Each satellite will point at a source target for
roughly  hours while approximately  groundbased radio
telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object
while within view on Earth
     According to Dr Joel Smith JPL's project manager for the
US Space VLBI meetings like those held at JPL will permit
Japan and Russia who have little previous experience in radio
interferometry to establish working relationships with the radio
astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex
observations required by the Space VLBI project
     One of our main activities is developing the methodology
for international coordination because the two spacecraft
simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while
using the groundbased radio telescopes to observe the same
celestial objects said Smith
     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN
facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in
Japan Russia and Green Bank WVa This global network of
groundbased radio telescopes will use precision clocks and
highspeed recorders to collect observation data and forward the
information to a correlator located at the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory in Socorro NM The correlator will
combine and process data then make it available to mission
investigators in Moscow Tokyo and JPL via electronic mail
     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created
by the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with
better resolution than has ever been achieved before by
groundbased radio telescopes allowing astronomers to take a
closer look at distant objects in space
     There is a long history of radio astronomy using
groundbased telescopes said Smith What we intend to do is to
extend radio astronomy into Earth orbit Our goal is to look
deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei quasars and other
active radio sources to understand what drives those things we
have seen so far with radio astronomy
     Smith noted that if one examines the active galactic
nuclei you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than
light and at energy levels that are millions of times greater
than you would expect
     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be
located in the cores of these galaxies and that they may fuel
the jets Smith hopes that by using Space VLBI to look further
into the cores this theory may be supported or disproved
     Russian spaceflight hardware including transponders and
transmitters are now being tested in the United States and
Japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this
year Analysis of this hardware will permit US scientists and
engineers to understand how to modify the highspeed VLBA
Correlator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd
data patterns that will originate from the more than 
groundbased radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI
     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the
Japanese and Russian space agency officials  like those held at
JPL in March  have proceeded smoothly Yet he knows that the
political uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country's
participation in the project
     Nothing is ever smooth he said but the Russians have
been incredibly open with us We always anticipated some
likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors
beyond our control yet there tends to be a way of keeping these
things going because scientists on both sides are trying hard
and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level
     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at
stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a
science mission
     The Japanese have been extremely cooperative since
international cooperation is essential to their science mission
he said
     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials
look at the US Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase
the technology involved with VSOP spacecraft and their highly
regarded Mach V launch vehicle
     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an
ambitious project JPL's Smith is satisfied that planning for the
Space VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and
political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project
     Fortunately we have the virtue of having two partners and
if either falls out we would still have something with the
other By themselves both spacecraft are independent
scientifically exciting missions

I have   MB worth uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining
one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in
Crystal City  Mr Mark Holderman works down the hall from me and can
be reached for comment at   or via email at
mholdermjscprofsnasagov

Mark proposed this design which he calls Geode rough on the
outside but a gem on the inside or the ET Strongback with
integrated hab modules and centrifuge  As you can see from file
geodeAgif it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank ET in place of much
of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom  The
white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte
Manipulator System SRMS and by the Reaction Control System RCS
pod  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting
can occur near the center of gravity CG of the Station as the mass
properties of the Station change during assembly

The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because
it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong
part of the Station  In the current SSF design docking forces are
limited to  pounds which seriously constrains the design of the
docking system

The ET would have a hatch installed preflight with little additional
launch mass  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit
contrary to some rumors which have circulated here but we've never
had a reason to do it while we have had some good reasons not to
performance penalties control debris generation and eventual
deorbit and impact footprint  Once onorbit we would vent the
residual H  The ET insulation SOFI either a erodes onorbit from
impact with atomic Oxygen or b stays where it is and we deploy a
Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating
the local space environment  Option b has the advantage of providing
further micrometeor protection  The ET is incredibly strong remember
it supports the whole stack during launch and could serve as the
nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits

The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment
Gyros to be used for attitude control while the RCS will be used
for gyro desaturation  The module also contains a deorbit system
which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a
controlled deorbit so we don't kill any more kangaroos like we
did with Skylab

The centrifuge which has the same volume as a hab module could be
used for longterm studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity
on humans  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device
for the whole attitude control system  The centrifuge is mounted on
one of the modules opposite the ET and the solar panels

This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical
data and communication systems getting leverage from the SSF work
done to date

Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City
and he reports that he was warmly received  However the rumors
I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter
seems more likely

Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design
you should see his notes in the GIF files  

Instead of posting a  MB file to scispace I tried to post these for
anonFTP in amesarcnasagov but it was out of storage space  I'll
let you all know when I get that done

 Pluto's atmosphere will start to freeze out around  and after about
  increasing areas of both Pluto and Charon will be in permanent
 shadow that will make imaging and geochemical mapping impossible

It's my understanding that the freezing will start to occur because of the
growing distance of Pluto and Charon from the Sun due to it's
elliptical orbit It is not due to shadowing effects 

Where does the shadow come from  There's nothing close enough to block
sunlight from hitting them  I wouldn't expect there to be anything block
our view of them either  What am I missing

Pluto can shadow Charon and viceversa

      Ethnocentric USian that I am I've assumed that we and the
xUSSR were the only countries with significant capabilities to track
noncooperative objects in low Earth orbit Grazing in a couple of 
databases recently  I found that Japan has some optical capabilities
along this line and also uses a radar designed for other purposes
for orbital debris surveys it isn't clear whether the radar can 
determine orbital elements for the objects it detects Abstracts of 
the articles are appended 


    This leads to the more general question do yet other people than 
the US Russia and Japan do space surveillance and if so how and 
why

Optical tracking of the experimental geodetic satellite EGS
TAKABE MASAO ITABE TOSHIKAZU ARUGA TADASHI
Radio Research Laboratory Review ISSN X vol 
March  p  In Japanese with abstract in English
     This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS
experimental geodetic satellite which was launched on August 
 by NASDA The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an
outline of the Radio Research Laboratory RRL optical ground       
station are discussed A star tracking technique for optical
equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit
prediction improvement are also described The accuracy of EGS
tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also
discussed In addition it is briefly demonstrated that the
position of the Japanese amateur satellite JAS which was
launched with the EGS was accurately determined by means of a      
satellite tracking video It is clear from this experiment that     
optical observation data ie satellite direction data are very  
useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      
stages Furthermore the results confirm the effectivenes of these  
two satellite optical tracking techniques

     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross 
section are determined from a series of observations made with a high
power VHF Doppler radar MU radar of Japan An automated data 
processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of 
orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail 
echoes or lightning atmospherics Although the results are preliminary 
they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      
observations using a much higher frequency It is found that the     
collision frequency of a Space Station of  km x  km size at an 
altitude of  km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as 
once per two years

      As the first attempt among MST mesosphere stratosphere 
troposphere type radars the MU middle and upper atmosphere radar 
features an active phased array system Unlike the conventional large 
VHF radars in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed 
to individual antenna elements each of  solid state power amplifier 
feeds each antenna element This system configuration enables very fast 
beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the 
antenna into independent subarrays because phase shift and signal 
divisioncombination are performed at a low signal level using 
electronic devices under control of a computer network The antenna 
beam can be switched within  microsec to any direction within the 
zenith angle of  deg Since a precise phase alignment of each element 
is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system careful 
calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna 
element was carried out Among various aircraft which may be used for 
this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to 
make a long term monitoring with the same system An antenna pattern 
monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific 
satellite OHZORA EXOSC A receiver named MUM MU radar antenna 
Monitor on board the satellite measures a CW signal of  to  
watts transmitted from the MU radar The principle of the measurement 
and results are discussed

     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent 
scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to  
km altitude is now being designed in Japan The radar will be built in 
Pontianak West Kalimantan Indonesia  deg N  deg E The 
system is a MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array 
configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan which has been 
in successful operation since  It will have a PA product of about 
 x  to the th W sq m P  average transmitter power A  effective 
antenna aperture with a sensitivity of approximately  times that of 
the MU radar This system configuration enables pulsetopulse beam 
steering within  deg from the zenith As is the case of the MU radar 
a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of 
the radar controller A brief description of the system configuration 
is presented

                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                             April  
                               AM PDT

Flight Sequence C is active the Spacecraft subsystems and instrument
payload performing well in Array Normal Spin and outer cruise
configuration with uplink and downlink via the High Gain Antenna uplink
at  bps downlink at the  K Engineering data rate

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April  all
payload instruments were automatically powered off by onboard fault
protection software  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory
was successfully reloaded on Monday April   To prepare for
Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight
Sequence C on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week a reload of Payload
Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning
beginning at  AM

Over this weekend the Flight Team will send realtime commands to
perform Differential OneWay Ranging to obtain additional data for
analysis by the Navigation Team  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator
testing will take place on Monday 

The Flight Sequence C uplink will occur on Sunday April  with
activation at Midnight Monday evening April   C has been modified to
include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C due
to Contingency Mode entry on April   These Magnetometer instrument
calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the
spacecraftgenerated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument
This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements
which occur during approach and mapping phases MAG Cals will require
the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state
and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points
in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations

Today the spacecraft is  km  mi from Mars
travelling at a velocity of  kilometerssecond  mph with
respect to Mars  Oneway light time is approximately  minutes 
seconds

                     MAGELLAN STATUS REPORT
                         April  

  The Magellan spacecraft continues to operate normally gathering
gravity data to plot the density variations of Venus in the
midlatitudes  The solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees
and spacecraft temperatures dropped  degrees C

  An endtoend test of the Delayed Aerobraking Data readout
process was conducted this week in preparation for the Transition
Experiment  There was some difficulty locking up to the data frames
and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in
equipment at the tracking station

  Magellan has completed  orbits of Venus and is now  days
from the end of Cycle  and the start of the Transition Experiment

  Magellan scientists were participating in the BrownVernadsky
Microsymposium at Brown University in Providence RI this week  This
joint meeting of US and Russian Venus researchers has been
continuing for many years

  A threeday simulation of Transition Experiment aerobraking
activities is planned for next week including Orbit Trim Maneuvers
and Starcal Star calibration Orbits

Writer Kathy Sawyer reported in today's Washington Post that Joseph Shea the 
head of the space station redesign has resigned for health reasons
 
Shea was hospitalized shortly after his selection in February  He returned
yesterday to lead the formal presentation to the independent White House panel
Shea's presentation was rambling and almost inaudible

I missed the presentations given in the morning session when Shea gave
his rambling and almost inaudible presentation but I did attend
the afternoon session The meeting was in a small conference room The
speaker was wired with a mike and there were microphones on the table for
the panel members to use Peons like me sat in a foyer outside the
conference room and watched the presentations on closed circuit TV In
general the sound system was fair to poor and some of the other
speakers like the committee member from the Italian Space Agency
also were almost inaudible

Shea didn't lead the formal presentation in the sense of running
or guiding the presentation He didn't even attend the afternoon
session Vest ran the show President of MIT the chair of the
advisory panel

 
Shea's deputy former astronaut Bryan O'Connor will take over the effort

Note that O'Connor has been running the daytoday
operations of the of the redesign team since Shea got sick which
was immediately after the panel was formed

 Hi
     I was reading through The Spaceflight Handbook and somewhere in
 there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them
 when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to
 the sun in a hyperbolic orbit The magnitude of such accelerations he
 estimated to be on the order of g He also says that this is may not
 be a big problem for manned craft because humans and this was published
 in  have already withstood accelerations of g All this is very
 longwinded but here's my question finally  Are g accelerations in
 fact humanly tolerable  with the aid of any mechanical devices of
 course If these are possible what is used to absorb the acceleration
 Can this be extended to larger accelerations

are you sure g is the right number as far as i know pilots are
blackout in dives that exceed g  g g seems to be out of human
tolerance would anybody clarify this please

lan


 
 Thanks is advance

  Besides this was the same line of horse puckey the mining companies claimed
 when they were told to pay for  restoring land  after strip mining

I aint talking the large or even the mining companies I am talking the small
miners the people who have themselves and a few employees if at allThe
people who go out every year and set up thier sluice box and such and do
mining the semiold fashion way okay they use modern methods toa point
 
 
 Lot's of these small miners  are no longer miners  THey are people living
 rent free on Federal land  under the claim of being a miner  The facts are
 many of these people do not sustaint heir income from mining  do not
 often even live their full time  and do fotentimes do a fair bit
 of environmental damage
 
 These minign statutes were created inthe 's's  when the west was
 uninhabited  and were designed to bring people into the frontier  Times change
 people change  DEAL  you don't have a constitutional right to live off
 the same industry forever  Anyone who claims the have a right to their
 job in particular  is spouting nonsense   THis has been a long term
 federal welfare program  that has outlived it's usefulness
 
 pat
 

Hum do you enjoy putting words in my mouth 
Come to Nome and meet some of these miners I am not sure how things go down
south in the lower  I used to visit but of course to believe the
medianews its going to heck or just plain crazy 
Well it seems that alot of Unionist types seem to think that having a job is a
right and not a priviledge Right to the same job as your forbearers SEE
Kennedy's and tel me what you see and the families they have married into
There is a reason why many historians and polisci types use unionist and
socialist in the same breath
The miners that I know are just your average hardworking people who pay there
taxes and earn a living But taxes are not the answer But maybe we could move
this discussion to some more appropriate newsgroup

 Pluto's atmosphere will start to freeze out around  and after about
  increasing areas of both Pluto and Charon will be in permanent
 shadow that will make imaging and geochemical mapping impossible

Where does the shadow come from  There's nothing close enough to block
sunlight from hitting them  I wouldn't expect there to be anything block
our view of them either  What am I missing

You're assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface
into sunlight  Not so  Even on Earth each pole gets several weeks without
sunlight in midwinter  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial
tilt and a much longer orbit  Pluto's north pole for example gets over
a century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light

At the moment we're in luck  Pluto and Charon are just past their
equinox when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles of each
If we get probes there soon only the immediate vicinity of one pole
on each will be in longterm shadow  This will get steadily worse the
longer we wait

No need to be depressed about this one  Lights aren't on during the day

   Description of External Tank option for SSF redesign deleted

Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City
and he reports that he was warmly received  However the rumors
I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter
seems more likely

Yo Ken let's keep ontop of things Both the External Tank and
Wingless Orbiter options have been deleted from the SSF redesign
options list Today's  edition of the New York Times reports
that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have
been dropped such as using the giant external fuel tanks used
in launching space shuttles and building a station around
an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed

Currently there are three options being considered as presented
to the advisory panel meeting yesterday and as reported in
today's Times

Option A  Low Cost Modular Approach
This option is being studied by a team from MSFC As an aside
there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC JSC and LaRC supporting
the SRT Station Redesign Team in Crystal City Both LeRC and
Reston folks are also onsite at these locations helping the respective
teams with their redesign activities Key features of this
option are
    Uses Bus a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's
     qualified for STS and ELV's The bus provides propulsion GNC
     Communications  Data Management Lockheed developed this
     for the Air Force
    A Power Station Capability is obtained in  Shuttle Flights
     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide  kW of power The vehicle
     flies in an arrow mode to optimize the microgravity environment
     ShuttleSpacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power
     source for  day missions
    Human tended capability as opposed to the old SSF sexist term
     of mantended capability is achieved by the addition of the
     US Common module This is a modified version of the existing
     SSF Lab module docking ports are added for the International
     Partners' labs taking the place of the nodes on SSF The
     Shuttle can be docked to the station for  day missions
     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability  EVA capability
    International Human Tended Add the NASDA  ESA modules and
     add another  kW of power
    Permanent Human Presence Capability Add a rd power module
     the US habitation module and an ACRV Assured Crew Return
     Vehicle

Option B  Space Station Freedom Derived
The Option B team is based at LaRC and is lead by Mike Griffin
This option looks alot like the existing SSF design which we
have all come to know and love 

This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for
use on all SSF assembly flights so does option A Also the 
number of flights is computed for a  inclination orbit
for both options A and B

The buildup occurs in six phases
    Initial Research Capability reached after  flights Power
     is transferred from the vehicle to the OrbiterSpacelab when
     it visits
    ManTended Capability Griffin has not yet adopted nonsexist
     language is achieved after  flights The US Lab is
     deployed and  solar power module provides  kW of power
    Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after  flights by
     keeping one Orbiter onorbit to use as an ACRV so sometimes
     there would be two Orbiters onorbit  the ACRV and the
     second one that comes up for Logistics  Resupply
    A Two Fault Tolerance Capability is achieved after  flights
     with the addition of a nd power module another thermal
     control system radiator and more propulsion modules
    After  flights the Internationals are onboard More power
     the Habitation module and an ACRV are added to finish the
     assembly in  flights

Most of the systems currently on SSF are used asis in this option 
with the exception of the data management system which has major
changes

Option C  Single Core Launch Station
This is the JSC lead option Basically you take a  ft diameter
cylinder that's  ft long slap  Space Shuttle Main Engines on
the backside put a nose cone on the top attached it to a 
regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket
motors and launch the can Some key features are
   Complete endtoend ground integration and checkout
    tangentially mounted fixed solar panels
   body mounted radiators which adds protection against
    micrometeroid  orbital debris
    centerline docking ports one on each end
    berthing ports
   a single pressurized volume approximately  cubic feet
    twice the volume of skylab
    floors center passageway between floors
    kW of housekeeping power
   graceful degradation with failures  power channels  thermal
    loops dual environmental control  life support system
   increased crew time for utilization
    microg thru out the core module

Now Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a milelong inflatable billboard in lowearth
orbit  
 
 the real purpose of the project is to help the environment 
The platform will carry ozone monitors 

 
I can't believe that a milelong billboard would have any significant
effect on the overall sky brightness  Venus is visible during the day
but nobody complains about that  Besides it's in LEO so it would only
be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright and even if
it would have some miniscule impact it would be only for a short time
as it goes zipping across the sky


I've seen satellites at midnight  they're not only in twilight o 



From the book Prodigal Genius The Life of Nikola Tesla by John J O'Neill

This remarkable conductivity of gases including the air at low
pressures led Tesla to suggest in a published statement in  a
system of lighting on a terrestrial scale in which he proposed to treat
the whole Earth with its surrounding atmosphere as if it were a
single lamp  
The whole Earth would be transformed into a giant lamp with the night 
sky completely illuminated   making the night as bright as day
 

Now my comments 

I'd like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine  sacred  
unsullied by the actions of humans  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
 none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature uncorruptable by men  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife  

The Space Age changed all that  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo etc on this view could only happen once  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome  even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky 

Yes I know aircraft are almost always in sight  I have to live 
in a very populated area  miles from an international airport 
currently where light pollution on the ground is ghastly  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here  virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped sculpted modified trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans cockroaches and squirrels 
or rats  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend getting away from it all paved roads indoor plumbing 
malls  and it felt good for a while  then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles   
miles to the east  Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic  So I know the skies are rarely perfect 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way  I mean they've been TRYING this forever  
like concerning Tesla's idea to banish night  wow  I don't watch 
commercial television but I can imagine just how disgusting beer 
truck or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high  
If ya' gotta make a buck on it displaying products in heaven at 
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life  

To be open about this though I have here my listing of the passage 
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend  tonight Friday at 
 pm EDT it will reach an altitude of  degrees on the 
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity  I'll be trying to see it 
if I can  it is my mealticket after all  So I suppose I could 
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky 
while complaining about billboards proposed by others  Be that 
as it may I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid 
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved

 All in all I'm not certain that the single goalprize of staying on the

 nongovernment sponsered unmanned moon landing then another for a
 manned
 moon landing then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
 lunar soil another for a reusable earthmoon shuttle and so forth 
 Find
 some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure  Having a single
 goal
 might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person
 appeared
 to win  And for those that didn't give up I find something a little
 scary
 about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters  I'd
 like to see as much a reward for cooperation as for competition

 Lastly about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was
 an
 English space magazine that had an ongoing discussion about moonbases
 on
 the cheap  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
 body produced how much lunar material it'd need for protection from
 solar
 flares etc  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine 
 Does this ring a bell to anyone

 ETHER IMPLODES  EARTH CORE IS GRAVITY

  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary 
ether sucking structures AND why we observe orbital motion
  

  LightYears between galaxies is a misnomer The distance is 
closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics of this phase 
of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion 
defining edge   ether spin  

  To find out about all of this I recommend studying history  

Well I'm working on it but getting a little impatient So far 
I've made it through Egyptian Chinese and Greek cultures and
up through the Rennaisance But so far these insights just don't 
seem to be gelling Perhaps it's in an appendix somewhere

In its own right though the history is kind of fun Lots of 
good yarns in there with varied and interesting characters And
more to come

vehicle DCY   is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways not
completely nosefirst  So why is the DCY look symmetric in every drawing
I've seen  I would think that an asymmetric design sort of like

I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest I've 
transcribed some of my notes below  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction

Note for newbies  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a
single staget to orbit reusable launch vehicle  The DCX vehicle is a 
scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO  It is 
currently undergoing tests  The DCY vehicle would be a full scale 
experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit  It has not yet been funded

On April th Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled 
Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions here at the University of
Illinois Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and
determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements  Although he is
not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project he has spent time with 
them recently using his software for their applications  He thus used 
the DCY project for most of his examples  While I don't think the details
of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers I hope
they aren't  I fell asleep during that part I think that many of you will
be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples

The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit  The
main restriction is that acceleration must remain below  Gs  I assume that
this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints but I
did not verify that  The Delta Clipper Y version has  engines   boosters
and  sustainers  The boosters which have a lower isp are shut down in 
midflight  Thus one critical question is when to shut them down  Mr Nelson
showed the following plot of acceleration vs time
                  
 G                  
                               As ASCII graphs go this is actually fairly 
                     	   good  The big difference is that the lines
 G                            made by the    should be curves which are
                                 concave up  The data is only approximate as
                                 the graph wasn't up for very long
 G                    
                        
                        
 G                     

                       
            sec     sec


As mentioned before a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below
  Initially all eight engines are started  As the vehicle  burns fuel the
accelleration increases  As it gets close to G the booster engines are 
throtled back  However they quickly become inefficient at low power so it
soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether  This causes the dip in 
accelleration at about  seconds  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines
bring the G level back up to about  and then hold it there until they cut
out entirely

The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit  The trajectory is aimed
for an altitude slightly higher than the nm desired and the last vestiges of
air drag slow the vehicle slightly thus lowering the final altitude to 
that desired

Questions from the audience  paraphrased

Q  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs rather than
    all at once

A  Very perceptive  Worth considering  They have not yet done the simulation    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given

Q  So what was the final payload for this trajectory

A  Can't tell us  Read Aviation Leak  He also apparently had a good 
    propulsion example but was told not to use it  

My question  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting
national security or MD protecting their own interests

The second example was reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch
up maneuver  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating and 
the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange  He showed graphs
of heating using two different models to show that both were very similar
and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate
The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC the DCY would have
about  degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 
 degrees south latitude

I would have asked about the landing maneuvers but he didn't know about that
aspect of the flight profile

I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest I've 
transcribed some of my notes below  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction

Michael Sternberg Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT was invited to speak at an
informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois
ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control Disarmament and
International Security  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the
company is using Russian launchers and satellites  I think it also helped that
his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program

The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson  went to Tonga
to visit a friend  While he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king
who happened to be a big TV fan  Matt bought the King a satellite dish which 
the king thought was really nifty  Since Tonga has a GNP of about  million
His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this  Matt thought
there probably was so at his suggestion Tonga applied for  geosynchronous
satellite slots  While this isn't entirely off the wall it was very unusual
seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and  is a lot of
slots

The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl
Hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions
supporting Tonga's case  Eventually Tonga ended up with  slots ranging from 
 E to  E slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside
According to Sternberg four of these from  E to  E are the best in the
world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and 
the Pacific Rim 

RIMSAT was formed to use these slots It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax
haven  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to
fill  slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have
cost approximately  billion  It's not easy to raise that kind of money
Eventually they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware  They began 
negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware  Mr Sternberg describes operating in 
Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time
Besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way
that people operate  For example everybody can sell you everything  
Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the
only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by

Eventually RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for  satellites at a cost
of  million  However Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup  Sternberg
says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who 
went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures  Since Glavkosmos was
out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities  He
again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms  Eventually
he worked out a deal and on Dec   he met with Koptev who heads the 
Russian space program to sign the deal  Koptev insisted on a few concessions
before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to 
allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT

The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware NPO Applied 
Mechanics  NPO PM to use their acronym  This organization is located in 
Siberia can't figure out how to spell the town I need an atlas and has built
about  vehicles since the dawn of the space age  Sternberg commented that
siberians are very different from Musovites  They are hard workers honest
people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners  At this
point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on
both siberians and midwesterners 

Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM  His company is 
apparently lookng for  million to invest in the firm to become  partnersIt apparently costs the Russians about  million to build a satellite that
would sell for  million in the west  If you want to give them 
specifications they'll build you a satellite  For the particular satellites
that RIMSAT will be using costs run about  per transponder year  This
compares to  ty in the US  They can sell their time for about 
million compared to  million in the US  RIMSAT will launch their 
satellites on Protons  To get the best prices they bought in bulk  They 
have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift I can give
you their address  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are
getting one used satellite from the Russians which is being moved into place
now

Tidbits

  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big
business because big business is just like what they have over there except
that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier

  Russian launches are self insured  The promise to replace a failed launch
within  months

  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell  which is a huge retirement
fund organization Cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia
and a fund operated by some of the big names in US aerospace which he says is
sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off

  He downplayed the instabilites in the exUSSR saying that we are worried
partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying
monolith  Italy gets a new government every two weeks but we don't worry 
because we're used to it  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what
really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much

  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering
money  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting
 in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in 
rubles  To get around this RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian
bank account  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that
the only the contractors get swindled by the government

  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western 
satellite industry  However Intelsat recently bought three of the same type
of satellites which was rather reassuring

  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive
technology and shorter lifetime  The older Gorizont Horizon satellites have
a lifetime of about  years while the more modern Express satellites compare
well with western technology and last about  years  While this is much 
shorter than  years for western satellites Sternberg downplayed the 
difference  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones  In addition
shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer
technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date
hardware

that scares me is the part about simply strapping  SSME's and

Galileo's HGA  is stuck

question  WHy couldn't Galileo's  course manuevers have been
designed such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point

The HGA isn't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might cook the
focal elements nor is its figure good on those scalesthe problem is
that the antenna itself could not be exposed to Venuslevel sunlight
lest like Icarus' wings it melt  I think it was glues and such as well
as electronics that they were worried about  Thus it had to remain
furled and the axis always pointed near the sun so that the small
sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA
A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus

Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are

Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges   

my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering

but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes  i just wondered
if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in

 string theory

     I agree  You can add dark matter and quarks and a lot of other
unobservable purely theoretical constructs in physics to that list
including the omnipresent black holes

     Will Bruce argue that their existence can be inferred from theory
alone  Then what about my original criticism when I said Curvature
can only exist relative to something noncurved  Bruce replied
'Existence' is undefined unless it is synonymous with 'observable' in
physics  We cannot observe more than the four dimensions we know about
At the moment I don't see a way to defend that statement and the
existence of these unobservable phenomena simultaneously  Tom

I hold that space cannot be curved for the simple reason that it can have
no properties
Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the
space To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved
is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing I
for one refuse to subscribe to such a view  Nikola Tesla

  What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away

Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are
quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by

Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges   

Gamma Ray Bursts GRBs are seen coming equally from all directions
However given the number of bright ones there are too few faint
ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far
as we can seeit is as if they are all contained within
a finite sphere or a sphere with fuzzy edges with us at the
center  These measurements are statistical and you can
always hide a sufficiently small number of a different
type of GRB with a different origin in the data  I am assuming
that there is only one population of GRBs

The data indicates that we are less than  of the radius of the center
of the distribution  The only things the Earth is at the exact center
of are the Solar system at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets
way beyond Pluto and the Universe  Cosmological theories placing
GRBs throughout the Universe require supernovatype energies to
be released over a timescale of milliseconds  Oort cloud models
tend to be silly even by the standards of astrophysics

If GRBs were Galactic ie distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy
you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of
the Galaxy for a 'disk' population or towards the Galactic center
for a spherical 'halo' population  We don't see this so if they
are Galactic they must be in a halo at least  light years in
radius and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda
Galaxy assuming that it has a similar halo  For comparison the
Earth is  lightyears from the center of the Galaxy

my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering
hyperspace 

The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes and we don't
see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti

but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes  i just wondered
if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in

There are more than  GRB different models in the refereed literature
Right now the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium
on new models until new observational evidence comes in

 In answer
to a question from Hawking Chahine described a proposed
dragfree satellite but confirmed that at this point it's only
a concept 

SO what's a drag free satellite   coated with WD

	I am puzzled by the term concept Drag free may already have
been flown It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would
more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and
ignore drag It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball
floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little
adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them The ball itself would
then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity
anisotropies whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously
adjusting its position to compensate for drag

This sounds like another of Ali AbuTaha's  different real causes of
the Challenger accident  As far as I know there has never been the
slightest shred of evidence for a harmonic resonance having occurred

The windshearinduced maneuvering probably did contribute to opening
up the leak path in the SRB joint again  it seems to have sealed itself

 pat  
        Well lets seeI took a class on this last fall and I have no
notes so I'll try to wing it  
        Here's how I understand it Remember from stellar evolution that 
black holes and neutron starspulsars are formed from high mass stars
MstarMsun  High mass stars live fast and burn hard taking
appoximately  years before going nova or supernova  In this time
they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane so any
of these if assumed to be the sources of GRB's will be in the plane of the
galaxy  
        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the
various satellites around the solar system Pioneer Venus has one either
Pion  or  GINGA and of course BATSE and we do distribution tests on our
catalog  These tests all  show that the bursts have an isotropic
distributionevenly spread out in a radial direction and they show signs of
homogeneity ie they do not clump in any one direction  So unless we are
sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy we are sampling the UNIVERSE
Not cool if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things  Now I
suppose you are saying Well we stil only may be sampling from inside the
disk  Well not necessarily  Remember we have what is more or less an
interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out
to beyond Plutopioneer  so we should be able with all of our detectors de
tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite  Here's an 
analogy  You see a plane overhead  You measure the angle of the plane from
the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system  One of your friends a mile
away sees the same plane and measures the angle from the zero point of his
arbitrary system which is the same as yours  The two angles are different
and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe
find a source  To my knowledge no one has been able to do this  
        I should throw in why halo and corona models don't work also  As I
said before looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts short
timescales high energy black holes and pulsars exhibit much of this type of
behavior  If this is the case as I said before these stars seem to be bound
to the disk of the galaxy especially the most energetic of the these sources
When you look at a simulated model where the bursts are confined to the disk
but you sample out to large distances say  mpc you should definitely see
not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction but a clumping of sources 
in the direction of the  galactic center  As I said before there is none of
these characteristics  
        
        I think that's all of itif someone needs clarification or knows
something that I don't know by all means correct me  I had the honor of
taking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these
different distributions so we pretty much kicked around every possible
distribution there was and some VERY outrageous sources Colliding pulsars
black holes pulsars that are slowing downstuff like that   It's a fun

Grapple HST  stow it in Cargo bay  do OMS burn to high altitude  

unstow  HST   repair  gyros  costar install  fix solar arrays

then return to earth

My guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost

why not  grapple  do all said fixes   bolt a small  liquid  fueled
thruster module  to  HST   then let it make the reboost  it has to be
cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug   that way now that
they are going to need at least   spacewalks  then they can carry

Sorry for asking a question that's not entirely based on the
technical aspects of space but I couldn't find the
answer on the FAQs 

I'm currently in the UK which makes seeing a Space Shuttle
launch a little difficult

However I have been selected to be an exchange student
at Louisiana State Uni from August and I am absolutely
determined to get to see a Space Shuttle launch sometime
during the year at which I will be in America

I hear there's a bit of a long mailing list so if someone
can tell me how to get tickets and where to get them from then
please Email me 

Thanks very much for your patience

And if anyone else wants to know tell me and I'll summarize

Actually the reboost will probably be done last so that there is a fuel
reserve during the EVAs in case they have to chase down an adrift
astronaut or something like that  But yes you've got the idea  the
reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up

My guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost
why not  grapple  do all said fixes   bolt a small  liquid  fueled
thruster module  to  HST   then let it make the reboost

Somebody has to build that thruster module it's not an offtheshelf
item  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware since it has to include
attitude control HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things
like thruster imbalance guidance there is no provision to feed gyro
data from HST's own gyros to an external device and separation you
don't want it left attached afterward if only to avoid possible
contamination after the telescope lid is opened again  You also get
to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is
done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle the lid stays closed for
the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from
thrusters and the like

The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the
reboost  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug well
suited to precisely this sort of job  Unfortunately it was costing
a lot to develop and the list of definitelyknown applications was
relatively short so it got cancelled

Re Space billboards

Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon once upon
a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered
a Goodyear Blimp in orbit  The idea was to use a large structure
that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has
Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination it could eventually
be seen by almost everyone on Earth  Only our collective disapproval
of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing
it  It had quite feasible economics which I will not post here
because I don't want to encourage the idea if you want to do such
a thing go figure it out for yourself

COMMERCIAL SPACE NEWSSPACE TECHNOLOGY INVESTOR NUMBER 

   This is number twentytwo in an irregular series on commercial 
space activities  The commentaries included are my thoughts on 
these developments  

   Sigh as usual I've gotten behind in getting this column 
written  I can only plead the exigency of the current dynamics in 
the space biz  This column is put together at lunch hour and after 
the house quiets down at night so data can quickly build up if 
there's a lot of other stuff going on  I've complied a lot of 
information and happenings since the last column so I'm going to 
have to work to keep this one down to a readable length  Have fun

 US COMMERCIAL SPACE SALES FLATTEN IN 
   The US Department of Commerce projects US commercial space sales 
will remain flat in  with current data showing only a  percent 
growth over   As published in US Industrial Outlook  
which was released in January revenues from the  US space 
business are currently projected to be about  M 
   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had 
shown double digits growth rates this year's projected results are 
driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry where sales are 
projected to drop from  satellites worth  M in  to  
satellites worth   M in   The US Industrial Outlook also 
projects US commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year 
and while predicting that  revenues will increase  percent to 
 M future sales will be adversely affected by the downward 
revision in Department of Defense launch plans                           
   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries 
revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to 
increase to  M primarily driven by increased revenues from 
broadcast and cable TV networks  Similarly remote sensing products 
and sales are projected to increase to  M in  up

   Commentary This is the first look at how the US commercial 
space industry is expected to do in   In general not a bad 
report  with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite 
manufacturing area  There changes of only a few satellites worth 
 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual 
projection  If we look forward over several years this market 
sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very 
successful in regaining international market share in the satellite 
business 
   Furthermore sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in 
the next revision of this data expected to be released about mid
year  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales including 
such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals 
appears to be missing from the January data set  DoC usually 
publishes a listing of  Space Business Indicators in midyear and 
the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released 
then  I expect the revised revenues should easily top  M if 
the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the 
numbers and the year should show about a  overall market growth 
   Looking beyond this year's data future markets look quite 
promising  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top 
 M by  if new mobile satellite services and direct 
broadcasting are implemented as planned and that mobile satellite 
station sales are expected to continue to growth at   per year 
through the mid 's  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic 
for nearterm market growth but I agree the trend should be for 
substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the 
next  years  My pessimism is due to more conservative 
assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and 
satellite direct broadcasting services  I don't believe all of the 
current players in the yettobeborn LEO communications satellite 
market and in the yettobeproven direct broadcasting market will 
be financial successes nor that sales growth will be as explosive 
as currently projected 
   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first 
release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research 
facilities  The  M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for 
the Spacehab module planned for launch in April on the Space 
Shuttle but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first 
sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module 

 DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS
   McDonnell Douglas Corporation which builds and markets the Delta 
launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts  Motorola 
Inc announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to 
launch most of the satellites in the satellite Iridium LEO 
communications constellation and in mid April McDonnell Douglas 
was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract 
   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium 
constellation launch is for at launch of least  Iridium 
satellites  Another  satellites have been contracted to be 
launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on  Proton vehicle 
launches  These  satellites planned for the Delta will be 
launched  at a time  providing for at least  launches  
Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation such as a 
planned onorbit spares may also be launched on Delta  Although 
details of the launch services contract were reported to be 
negotiation and not yet final 
   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC bidding a variant of 
their Delta II launcher  This contract is only initially worth  
million but establishes a set of launch options for up to  
launches encompassing launches from  through   These 
launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global 
Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites plus other 
programs  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is 
expected to be exercised this year after which the USAF is expected 
to request launches of up to  Deltas per year for at least  years  
Under this contract the USAF can also request launch on demand 
services from MDC for the  time period with a launch to 
occur within  days of the request 
    Commentary  If these two contracts are fulfilled they should 
provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program 
through the turn of the century  Combined these two contracts have 
a potential for about  launches worth about  M to MDC and 
sustaining a core business base of  Myear  Other contracts 
for international and commercial payloads as well as for NASA 
Medium ELVclass payloads will add to this business base  keeping 
MDC as a viable commerical launch company 
    However it should be noted there are risk elements in these 
contracts  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has 
not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for 
operation in the US nor has Motorola lined up all the financing 
and financial partners for the Iridium venture  Without these 
approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches  
But hopefully these uncertainties will be settled this year 
   Similarly the USAF MLV III program has been the target of 
several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of 
the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III 
program in favor of the USAF NLSSpacelifter program  At this 
time while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed future 
funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts 
is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy 
reviews  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and 
Congress propose cancellation of all ELV upgrade programs 
including the MLV programs in favor of the proposed Spacelifter 
program  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget 
deliberations particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to 
find in the shrinking US Defense budget 
 
 COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC GOAHEAD
   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing 
satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of 
Commerce's Office of Space Commerce  A license was granted to 
WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland California to build and 
operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multispectral 
images of the Earth 
   Commentary  There has been little data released on this venture 
by WorldView and the DoC other than the announcement of the 
operating and construction license  This was reported to be at the 
request of WorldView  Most industry speculation identifies this new 
venture as a Star Wars spinoff using SDItype technology to 
provide digital Earth sensing data and heavily integrated into 
digital GIS databases for remote sensingGIS users  Most probable 
customers for this service include exploration geologists 
agricultural planners and urban planners  
   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 
 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act  The Act as passed last 
November provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote 
sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices  Prior to 
this act remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to 
all users at the same prices and private remote sensing ventures 
would have had to sell at the governmentset Landsat data prices 
   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote 
sensing ventures working their way through the system at different 
stages of development  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite 
systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing 
data market for the next decade or so  In contrast to these large 
governmentsponsored remote sensing systems smaller market ventures 
such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use 
innovative technology and I believe can find profitability on the 
margin  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures 
appearing in the next year or so 
                 
 INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT 
   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General 
Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker 
despite having failed in the last  Atlas launches  In a recent 
analyst's report Morgan Stanley said We are more than ever 
convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 
plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash
generating unit  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate 
management Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are 
cleared up the unit could see  M in earnings per year by  and 
 M per year by   This is based upon GD's projection of 
capturing about  Atlas launches per year on the world market 
   Commentary  Three failures in a row of their launch system has 
hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division  Since GD has 
restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses 
many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might 
be next to be sold  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space 
Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker despite current 
problems  if they can get their act together  Sales are projected 
to be about  M in  which will probably generate a loss of 
about  M  If GD can capture their projected share of the space 
launch market and if they have managed to clean up the reliability 
of their Atlas launchers then they could generate healthy profits 
from those sales  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur 
program is back on track this division will continue to show 
substantial losses 
   In response to the selloff rumors in my opinion this operation 
is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability  
To do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional 
management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm  
In GD SSD's case to get the division back on track the management 
team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with 
the Atlas Centaur as well as in selling Atlas services  This would 
indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch 
operations could find such talent inhouse and be able to convince 
customers to buy their launch services  Optimally the firm would 
have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in 
marketing space technology internationally as well  Candidates for 
this might be TRW Rockwell Lockheed and Martin and possibly 
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing  But most of those firms have cash 
flow problems MDC have had a substantial business contraction 
Boeing and MDC are involved with other launch firms Lockheed 
or have taken on substantial debt Martin  And coming up with the 
 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of 
change for any company 
 
  ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND
   Arianespace the operator of the Ariane launch system is 
projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 's  In early 
February Arianespace released their annual market survey which 
detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the 
next decade 
   Over short run Arianespace expects to retain their dominant 
position and sustain a majority share of the launch market  Of  
international and commercial launches planned through  Ariane 
holds contracts for  General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds  
contracts McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds  and Great Wall's Long 
March vehicle holds  launch contracts 
   Threequarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can 
compete are projected to come from communications satellites with 
the remaining  split between weather Earth observation and 
scientific satellites  Most of the future telecommunications demand 
growth is predicted to come from the AsiaPacific region 
   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of 
individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will 
continue with these groups investing in heavier satellites with 
larger communications payloads carrying more transponders 
Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications 
satellites should increase by   over today's average level to 
about  kg in GEO 
   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain 
strong over the next three years but in the second half of the 
decade Arianespace predicts demand will decrease  Arianespace 
bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder 
demand and supply  particularly as new data compression techniques 
appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing 
or nearterm transponders 
   One of the significant possible changes in the market was 
identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles including Russian 
launch systems  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term 
investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade 
off between launch service quality and price and that Russian and 
other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities 
and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal 
   Commentary  Ariane releases their market surveys annually and 
I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSNSTI  
Comparing the two surveys there aren't outstanding differences in 
the numbers   The most notable change is the consideration of new 
data compression techniques reducing the demand for new physical 
transponders on orbit
   I note that in contrast to some predictions demand for space
based communications transponders appears to be remain strong While 
fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the 
established pointtopoint telecommunications markets growing 
demand for telecommunications services world wide and for pointto
multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space 
transponder demand  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability 
service but only from established point A to established point B 
To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable 
between the points and while there are improved network solutions 
installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost 
millions or billions of dollars  
   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground 
network structure satellites still offer the most cost effective 
solution  And if new services are required into a new region it is 
cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of 
thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite 
network  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services and 
has kept demand high  The replacement market for fiberoptics is 
growing as well since as demand grows between the points serviced 
it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to 
handle the increase in traffic 
   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still 
growing rapidly satellite market projections remain rosy  But 
satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes  Current 
generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at  years of 
onorbit service or more in contrast to  years of service from 
last generation's satellites  This has cut back some of the launch 
demand as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite 
launches over longer intervals 
   And as last note Arianespace didn't flag it this year but it 
looks like the space transportation market will be rather over
supplied by existing launch systems in the near term  The annual 
commercial launch demand is for about  medium sized satellites 
per year  From the supply side Ariane is capable of launching up 
to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year Delta is capable of 
about  per year Atlas is capable of  Long March  
Japan's HVehicle  Russia's Proton capable of  and other 
systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another  medium launches per 
year  That's a lot of capability for a small market 
   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial 
launches

 NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT 
   The  Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has 
spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety 
rules  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt 
the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation 
of range safety rules  
   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown one of 
two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed  Such a failure 
typically scrubs a launchand a NASA range safety officer at 
Wallops Island VA issued a mission abort order about a minute 
before the scheduled Pegasus launch  Somehow this command was 
overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the 
communications channels and the Pegasus was launched despite the 
valid abort call 
   Fortunately the Pegasus functioned as expected and the abort 
command receiver was not needed  But this incident did spark an 
investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreedto 
launch constraint rules and was not obeyed 
   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety 
Board NTSB with support from NASA OSC and the Air Force  This 
investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an 
incident involving a space launch  According to the NTSB their 
investigation will take about  months and is primarily looking at 
lines of authority communications links and safety procedures used 
in the launch 
  Commentary This is the first time that the NTSB has led an 
investigation into a space launch  Their leadership was requested 
by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space 
Transportation who had licensed the commercial launch  
   At the time of writing this column some of the initial 
investigations have been concluded and some of the results are 
starting to leak out into the trade press  Apparently  or four 
different communications channels were in use during the test After 
the abort destruct receiver stopped responding the NASA test 
director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops 
Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch  
According to the mission rules this should have stopped the launch 
Somehow the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed and the 
NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B carrying 
the Pegasus at about  seconds before launch  Differing 
explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed  with the 
best set being that clear lines of communications and clear 
definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team and 
understanding of the mission rules were not established before the 
launch  
   As we see more and more commercial launches more of these 
procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved   
This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has 
been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem as they 
do with commercial aircraft problems  
   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with 
procedures and communications and will be cleared up with issuance 
of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how 
specific lines of authority should be delineated 

 ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED
   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new 
small space launch system based upon converted ICBM components  
Two versions of the launcher are being marketed the Aerokosmos 
winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus and the Severkosmos 
launched from a mobile ground transporter  The Aerokosmos is 
projected to deliver  kg to a  km circular orbit or  kg to 
an  km circular orbit and the Severkosmos to be capable of  
kg to  km orbits and  kg to  km  Also proposed to be used 
with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 
'Sineva'  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a exmilitary 
establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of 
spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the 
Buran shuttle system  They are located near the NPO Energia 
facility in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow 
   Commentary There's very little released information on this new 
venture  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking 
for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their inhouse 
knowledge of exSoviet launch systems  It adds to the list of numerous 
commercial space startups announced from the exSoviet Union 
   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants 
of exSoviet ICBMs but I can't identify any key customers being 
targeted or substantial financial backing

 GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING
   In late January Georgia Tech Research Institute released the 
results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial 
rocket launching site in Camden County Georgia at the old Kingsland 
Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast  The preliminary 
study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch 
site stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected 
low investment returns plus environmental and other geographic 
considerations  However the report did say the site might be ideal 
for other aerospace uses and recommended other potential uses 
   Commentary  This should put the nails in the coffin of the 
Kingsland Commercial Launch Site  While other sites are still 
proceeding with commercial launch site development plans Kingsland 
found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant and if 
substantial infrastructure had to be put in then the expected 
returns were too low to justify the cost of development  
   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the 
feasibility of a commercial launch site  These include
   Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage 
sufficient to recover setup costs
   Is there a market advantage of using the site
   Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site
   Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the 
investment  
   Other commercial launch site ventures  including those at 
Woomera Poker Flat Cape York White Sands Alabama OffShore 
Platform Hawaii and Vandenberg have to also be judged against 
these criteria  In my opinion some of these ventures are flying 
on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds

 SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING
   In one of his last official acts former President Bush 
authorized space technology transfer for several joint space 
ventures between US and other firms  One of these was a proposed 
use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster  With that 
regulatory impediment removed the stage Capricornia launch 
vehicle will start development later this year planning for a first 
launch in the  time period  The Capricornia is described as 
a small stage all solid booster designed to put  Kg into 
LEO  Several launch sites are being examined for the system 
including  on the Iberian peninsula and  on the Canary Islands  
Originated by INTA in Spain the project reports it has   M in 
development funding and will use technology from Argentina's Condor 
launch vehicle as well as from the US 
   Commentary  Several firms have identified a market opportunity 
in providing a small launcher for the European market  Small 
payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either 
Ariane piggyback launches or the USItalian Scout launcher  
However Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited and the Scout 
program is being phased out accompanied by some disarray in the 
Italian government and space industry regarding any followon 
system  
   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch 
system  Surprisingly enough ESA has not supported development of 
such a system within the current space funding structure  Studies 
have been performed by British Aerospace Aerospatiale Deutsche 
Aerospace and Italian organizations but with the exception of the 
SwedishPacAstro system reported below I have not been able to 
find any other European development work with even a rumor of 
funding for hardware 
   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the 
Argentinian Condor launcher  There have been some interesting 
rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space 
launcherIRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled 
the country in the 's and early 's 
   What is known is in Feb  the Argentinian Air Force formally 
transferred control of the Condor  missile program to the new 
civilian Argentinian national space agency Comison Nacional de 
Atividades Espaciales  CNAE  The Condor  program was described 
as originating in  expanding upon the smaller Condor  rocket 
program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German 
firms  The Condor  was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq 
in the mid's  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and 
tested but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package 
lagged that of the propulsion system 
   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first 
scientific satellite in late   The US  M  Kg SACB 
satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes 
cooperative experiments from Italy and the US No launch vehicle has

 PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP
   PacAstro a small launch firm in Herndon Virginia announced in 
late February it had received a  M launch reservation contract 
from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA 
launch vehicle   This will be performed as part of the Polar 
Satellite Service PSS a joint Norwegian Space Center Swedish 
Space Corp program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and 
offering small satellite launches into the polar regions  According 
to PacAstro PSS is also performing an  M upgrade of the Andoya 
launch facilities including a new integration facility and a fully
enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like 
the PacAstro PA  PacAstro has been chosen as the main 
alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service 
to be offered by PSS from Andoya  The date of the launch of the 
Swedish satellite was not specified 
   Commentary  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and 
funding for their launch vehicle for some time now  The PA is a 
small two stage rocket fueled by RP and Liquid Oxygen  From 
PacAstro's literature the engines designed for the PAseries 
rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the Lunar 
MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW and are capable of putting a 
 Kg satellite into a  km circular polar orbit  
   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its 
first three PA vehicles with a first launch planned for  and 
 orbital launches planned for   My records show PacAstro hired 
TRW to provide marketing support and systems design  with primary 
engineering to be done by AeroAstro a small satellite builder 
closely associated with PacAstro headquartered in the same 
building  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering 
launch operations vehicle subsystems and marketing support 
Sumitomo Corp of Tokyo is a first round investor and sits on the 
board of directors  
   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least 
 K  Some sources place this of high as  M but has been 
searching for about a year for the additional  M needed to 
design build and launch their first set of vehicles 
   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help 
bring some investors on board but by my estimate they will need 
much more than the single  M sale to put their venture into real 
hardware 

 CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED
    In early March it was reported a joint satellite communications 
venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works  
As reported in the Taipei press China Development Corp CDC 
headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist 
Party is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China 
Great Wall Industry Corp with the objective of launching a regional 
communications satellite CDC would cover about  of the satellite 
system cost US  M in exchange for rights to  of the 
satellite's communications channels  
   Commentary  This announcement came close on the heels of the 
release of Taiwanese plans for space development released in mid 
January   In those plans the National Space Program Office of 
Taiwan will launch  satellites starting with ROCSAT a  Kg 
scientific spacecraft planned for launch in   Two additional 
satellites are planned both communications satellites   TRW has 
been helping Taiwan plan this program budgeted at T B US  
M through   
   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this 
venture and those of the NSPOT but there might be a connection  
While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures the 
current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two 
separate sastellite ventures 
   The reported name for the TiawaneseChinese system is Asiasat
 but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing 
Hong Kongbased Asiasat program involving Chinese Hong Kong and 
other Asian investors other than using it as an organizational 
model  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing 
venture  it could provide excellent firsthand experience to 
Taiwan for a very low cost which then can be used in later 
satellite ventures  But there are internal political issues between 
Taiwanese and Chinese ventures but putting any joint venture 
through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to 
proceed 
   In any case the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with 
substantially growth projected in space services and revenues  This 
is just another indicator to add to the list 

 SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES
   South Korea's Trade Industry and Resources Ministry recently 
announced plans to invest US B in research and development and 
another US B into manufacturing and research facilities for 
advanced aerospace technologies  Space technologies have been 
specifically targeted as part of this program beginning with 
manufacture and launch of an advanced multipurpose satellite by 
  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's 
aerospace technology to the level of the world's top  countries by 
                                 
   Commentary South Korea has been quietly working to develop its 
national aerospace industry specifically including space 
activities I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are 
coming into the commercial space market 
   As part of their national effort  national telecommunications 
satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct  
on Delta Designated Koreasat  and  the platforms will provide 
television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula 
southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea 
   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on 
Ariane in Aug  called Uribyol Our Star and costing about US 
 M  Uribyol is planned for piggyback launch in October of 
this year again on Ariane and will be entirely made in Korea  
Uribyol projected for a  launch will be an environment
monitoring microsatellite 
   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth 
observation satellites  The KEOS Korean Earth Observation System 
project which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean 
government would use two or three kg spacecraft equipped with 
optical and microwave sensors
   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel 
military effort to establish the capabilities for building and 
launching small military satellites by   Supposedly a 
government panel had been established to oversee such an effort 
funded at US   M between  and  in anticipation of an  
expected pullout of US intelligencegathering systems from the 
Korean peninsula       
   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts South Korean 
is also pursuing production work either as offsets to existing 
aerospace technology contracts for example McDonnell Douglas is 
offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as 
part of the Koreasat launch contracts or for production of 
consumer space items among other products South Korea exports 
satellite receiver television setups to Japan and Samsung has 
announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals  
   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies  
Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector 
for commercial space services primarily for telecommunications a 
South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition 
of commercial space market there over the next decade 

 SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH
   As announced in the last CSNSTI each issue will give the 
results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and 
investments  The table below summarizes results to the end of 
March  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the 
market as a whole as represented by the SP  index  Since  
of the values included in the index are US firms this represents a 
general increase in the market value of spacerelated firms  The 
increase in the first quarter is more than in all of   which 
is a very promising sign although future months may reverse this 
trend The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite 
well but the Pure Play portfolio  consisting of stocks of firms 
which are pure plays in space technologies  has also surpassed its 
results in all of   We'll keep an eye on these

   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to
the forefront in   First in February the Russians deployed a
m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from
the Mir Space Station  While this Banner reflector was blank
NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner
reflectors will be available to advertisers who could use a space
based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV
commercial as filmed from the Mir
   The second development has been that Space Marketing Inc the
same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga
booster and COMET spacecraft is now pushing the Environmental
Billboard  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the
University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory the Environmental
Billboard is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to
x meters  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area
deployed by the inflatable 'frame'
   To help sell the concept the spacecraft responsible for
maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ozone reading
sensors to continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's
delicate protective ozone layer according to Mike Lawson head of
SMI Furthermore the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum
exposure of  days it will be released to reenter the Earth's
atmosphere According to IMI as the biodegradable material burns
it will release ozonebuilding components that will literally
replenish the ozone layer The remaining spacecraft will monitor
the atmosphere for another year before it too reenters and burns
up and adds to the ozone supply
   This would not be a cheap advertisement costing at least several
millions of dollars exact costs were not available  But SMI
estimates that market exposure would be X that of the people who
watched the SuperBowl where a second advertising 'unit' cost
  Since SMI is located in Atlanta Georgia it is being
promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 
Summer Olympics in Atlanta
  
But back to Brian's questions
And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
news blip  How serious is this project  Is this just in the wild
idea stage or does it have real funding
  
    See above As for serious  if they can get  M or so my
estimate of  for development costs and a flight unit plus
 M for a launch then it's probably real  They are claiming to
tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for
optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon
someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated
launch  That's a  M cost they need to raise right there
    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as
well  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use
of launch vehicle advertising already  While I don't think the
legal challenges would win out and yes I am an amateur astronomer
and no I don't really like the idea of this additional light
pollution but I know of no prohibition of it  the legal
challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive
aspects of the advertising  I can imagine several ways to make the
advertisers look like louts for doing this  which would change
positive market exposure to negative market exposure and negate the
space advertising advantage  Would you spend  M to look like an
idiot
   And light pollution might not be too bad  if it's in a low
enough orbit and it relies upon reflected light only it would
only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before
dawn  For maximum market exposure you want to have it visible just
after dusk minimizing impact on astronomy since that's the time
of worse seeing due to daynight thermal turbulence  It might still
be a problem but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this
    As for having real funding  none that I can identify  There
were about  expressions of interest made on the Conestoga
advertising opportunity but that included curious folks and was for
only a  commitment  I haven't heard of any serious funding
for this but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking
for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more  But I
am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time
  
   And if anybody wants to crosspost this to sciastro please be
my guest  I don't have posting privileges to that area or at least
I don't THINK I do

Brian Yamauchi asks Regarding orbital billboards
And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
news blip  How serious is this project  Is this just in the wild
idea stage or does it have real funding
  
    Well I had been collecting data for next edition of the
Commercial Space NewsSpace Technology Investor To summarize
  
SPACE ADVERTISING
    First advertising on space vehicles is not new  it is very
common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the
space launch vehicle  For example the latest GPS launcher had the
very prominent logos on its side of
    McDonnell Douglas the Delta launcher
    Rockwell International who built the GPS satellite
    USAF who paid for the satellite and launch and
    the GPSNavstar program office
   This has not been considered paid advertising but rather
public relations since the restrictions have been such that only
organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the
side and there was no money exchanged for this  However putting
a ' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras
is advertising as much as it is public relations in my
opinion  And by the way I note that the DCX test vehicle has
rather prominent McDonnellDouglas and SDIO logos on the side
   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials
for use of space vehicles for advertising or placing large
advertising signs in orbit  On the shuttle for example I know of
several serious studies in the early and mid 's which looked at
putting logos on the external tank or on the sides of the payload
bay  These ventures would be different than public relations in
that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms
participating on that flight and would involve payment of sums for
the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization  For
example painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can or putting a
Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras
would scan past it
  
ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES
   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about
 when several noninvolved foreign organizations were allowed
to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch  An Italian shoe
company was one of the first advertisers I remember  Similarly
Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last
Olympic games and have gleefully shown banners and other items from
participating firms and organizations  Mars candy bars for
example got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the
British visiting cosmonaut to Mir
   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch
vehicles  The upcoming Conestoga launch in June putting the COMET
recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements
on the side for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie The Last
Action Hero  Besides the usual logos of the participating
organizations Columbia pictures has paid  to put ads on the
main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket its booster
rockets and on the COMET payload which will orbit the Earth for
one month  A concept for this advertising display was published in
Space News magazine a couple of months ago
   As a side note Robert Lorsch an advertising executive is
talking about suing NASA  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he
created with the space agency in  to form corporate advertising
sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the
space program  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on
the upcoming COMET NASA violated an agreement that it would not use
his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and
receiving compensation   This is being disputed since the launch
is a commercial launch and NASA is receiving none of the
advertising revenues but the funding for the COMET program is
coming from NASA
  
ORBITAL BILLBOARDS
   Orbital billboards have been the staple of science fiction for
some time  Arthur C Clarke wrote about one example and Robert
Heinlein described another in The Man Who Sold the Moon  Several
different potential projects have been developed although none have
been implemented but the most real prior to  being the Eiffel
II project which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in
orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bicentennial

That is an idea The most efficient moon habitat 

also the idea of how to get the people off the moon once the prize was won

Also the idea of how to rescue someone who is dying on the moon

Maybe have a area where they can all see each other and can help each other
if something happens 

I liek the idea of one prize for the first moon landing and return by a
nongovernmental body

Also the idea of then having a moon habitat race 

I know we need to do somthing to get people involved

Eccentric millionairebillionaire would be nice We see how old Ross feels
about it After all it would be a great promotional thing and a way to show he
does care about commericalization and the people Will try to broach the
subject to him 

Moonbase on the cheap is a good idea NASA and friends seem to take to much
time and give us to expensive stuff that of late does not work hubble and
such Basically what is the difference between a mil peice of junk and a
multi mil piece of junk I know junk

I like option C of the new space station design 
It needs some work but it is simple and elegant

Its about time someone got into simple construction versus overly complex

Basically just strap some rockets and a nose cone on the habitat and go for
it

Might be an idea for a MoonMars base to

Maybe age Jemison a few years makeup and such and have her as the only

anything can happen 

Imagine a AstronautCrew member to find themselves in the th Century as the

     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution
crudely speaking indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution

   Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are
   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by

   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges   

Now in the good old days before GRO data it was thought the
gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy it was expected that
GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population
within a few hundred light years or that they were in the galactic
halo Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed
also to be fair it was noted that the brightest burster was
probably in the LMC suggesting theorists might be wrong back then
	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo
population should show anisotropy a local disk population is
ruled out completely at this stage  to avoid the anisotropy you
have to push the halo out the energy then gets large the mechanism
of getting NS out that far becomes questionable and we should start
to see for example the Andromeda's bursters
	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution
but only just  but no one can think of a plausible source with
the right spectrum Or it can be a cosmological distances hence
isotropy and the edge is the edge of the Universe 
If at cosmological distances you need very high energy to detect
and a very compact source for spectrum ergo a neutron star
colliding with another neutron star or black hole Even then getting
the spectrum is very hard but conceivable

	If we know anything about physics at that level
the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic
strings wrong spectrum for one thing

The situation is further complicated by recent claims that
there are two classes of sources   in the colliding NS
they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the
NSNS and NSBH collision scenarios respectively

   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering
   hyperspace 

   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes  i just wondered
   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in

If you can think of one remember to invite me to Stockholm

Subject Next standoff
Status R

Redwood City CA API  A tense standoff entered its third week
today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with
charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs

Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound but
some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside
have been terminated  Others claim to be staying of their own free
will but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm

In conversations with authorities Jobs has given conflicting
information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the
industry  At times he has claimed to have hardware which will blow
anything else away while more recently he claims they have stopped
manufacturing their own

Agents from the ATF AppleTaligent Forces believe that the group is
equipped with serious hardware including caliber pieces and
possibly Canon equipment

The siege has attracted a variety of spectators from the curious to
other cultists  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations
including a young man who will identify himself only as Bill and
claims to be the MSiah

Former members of the cult some only recently deprogrammed speak
hesitantly of their former lives including being forced to work
hour days and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies  There were
frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of
interpersonal computing which rejects traditional roles

Latenight vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on
federal marshals  Loud rock and roll mostly Talking Heads blares
throughout the night  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own
apocalyptic prophecies a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers
carry Jobs' own speeches  typically beginning with a chilling I
want to welcome you to the 'Next World'

largest in the world until the the start of the th century

The Astronomy of Birr Castle was written by Patrick Moore who now sits on
the committee which is going to restore the telescope The remains are on
public display all year round  the massive support walls the  foot long
tube and other bits and pieces This book is the definitivie history of
how one man the Third Earl of Rosse pulled off the most impressive
technical achievement perhaps ever in the history of the telescope and
the discoveries made with the instrument

Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the book's sale to help restore
the telescope Astronomy Ireland is making the book available world wide by
mail order It's a fascinating read and by ordering a copy you bring the day
when we can all look through it once again that little bit nearer

   I'm on a factfinding mission trying to find out if there exists a list of
   potentially worldbearing stars within  light years of the Sun
   Is anyone currently working on this sort of thing  Thanks

   Dan
    

In principle any star resembling the Sun mass luminosity might have planets
located in a suitable orbit There several within  ly of the sun They are
single stars for double or multiple systems might be troublesome There's a
list located at amesarcnasagov somewhere in pubSPACE I think it is called
starsdat By the way what kind of project if I may know

to create a dark sky zone  where in all light emissions are protected

they have a  mile EMCON zone  Theoretically they can prevent

In practice they use it mostly to  control  large radio users

 In answer
to a question from Hawking Chahine described a proposed
dragfree satellite but confirmed that at this point it's only
a concept

SO what's a drag free satellite   coated with WD


     TRIAD the first dragfree satellite was designed and built by the 
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched  Sept   The 
satellite was in three sections separated by two booms  The central section 
housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System which consisted of a proof 
mass of special nonmagnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity  The 
proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit free from drag and radiation 
pressure  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered 
around the proof mass thereby flying the entire satellite drag free

     TRIAD was one of the APLdesigned Navy Navigation Satellites  The 
ndgeneration operational navigation satellites flying today NOVA use a 
singleaxis version of DISCOS  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be 
powered by an RTG APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space in 

     Further info on TRIAD DISCOS etc can be found in Spacecraft Design

in Mead's The Big Ball of Wax where the lovers are watching 
the constellation Pepsi Cola rising over the horizon and noting
the some 'stars' had slipped cause the Teamsters were on strike

This was the inspiration for my article on orbiting a formation

 Graydon

That would not explain why widely separated detectors such as on Ulysses
and PVO and Ginga et al would see a burst at the same time  In fact be
fore BATSE having this widely separated Interplanetary Network was the
only sure way to locate a random burst  With only one detector one cannot
locate a burst except to say It's somewhere in the field of view  With
two detectors one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector
to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky  With three detectors
one gets intersecting annuli giving two possible locations  If one of these
locations is impossible because say the Earth blocked that part of the 
sky voila you have an error box

BATSE by having  detectors of its own can do its own location determination
but only to within about  degrees would someone at GSFC like David like
to comment on the current state of location determination  Having inde
pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty

You did touch on something that you didn't mean to though  Some believe
in a reference that I have somewhere that absorptionlike features seen
in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector  It would be
a mean nasty God though that would have a NaI crystal act like a  Gauss
neutron starbut this is getting too far afield

I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers
have the right to a dark uncluttered night sky

Let me give you an example  When you watch TV they have commercials to pay
for the programming  You accept that as part of watching  If you don't like
it you can turn it off  If you want to view the night sky and there is a
floating billboard out there you can't turn it off  It's the same 
reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas

civil rights

I say 
	Any reasonably indepth perusal of American history will show
	you that many WASPs have continued the practices of prejudice
	discrimination and violence against others of different
	races religions and beliefs despite the law

Pat says
If you really are annoyed   get some legislation
to create a dark sky zone  where in all light emissions are protected
in the zone  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone  Did you
know about that  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia
they have a  mile EMCON zone  Theoretically they can prevent
you from running light AC motors like air conditioners and Vacuums
In practice they use it mostly to  control  large radio users

I say
What I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that presumably
would move around in the sky  I for one am against legislating
at all  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy and
would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
aesthetic values that make us human  This includes the need for wild
and unspoiled things including the night sky

Seen that movie already Or one just like it
Come to think of it they might send someone on
a quest to get rid of the dang thing

Actually the idea like most good ideas comes from Jules Verne not
The Gods Must Be Crazy  In one of his lesser known books I can't
remember which one right now the protagonists are in a balloon gondola
travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon when
one of them drops a fob watch  They then speculate about the reaction
of the natives to finding such a thing dropped straight down from heaven
But the notion is not pursued further than that

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff  Do you know

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff if you assume
no new launcher development  If you assume new launcher development with
lower costs as a specific objective then you probably don't want to
build something HLVsized anyway

Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans  It
doesn't take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large
gas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster all of which
would have far better costeffectiveness

Henry I made the assumption that he who gets there firstest with the mostest
wins 

Ohhh you want to put in FINE PRINT which says Thou shall do wonderous RD
rather than use offtheshelf hardware Sorry didn't see that in my copy
Most of the Pournellesque proposals run along the lines of some dollar
amount reward for some simple goal  

You go ahead and do your development I'll buy off the shelf at higher cost or
even Russian but I also assume that there'd be some Buy US provos in there
and be camped out in the Moon while you are launching and assembling little
ittybitty payloads in LEO with your laser or gas gun  And working out the
bugs of assembly  integration in LEO 

Oh hey could I get a couple of CanadARMs tuned for the lunar environment  I
wanna do some teleoperated prospecting while I'm up there

Voyager  has the unusual  luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the

There are no Mariner craft from which we are still receiving data  I believe
you are referring to one or more of Pioneers  through  launched from

Two and a half years ago I purchased a set of CD ROMs from the

were Space Sciences Sampler and Voyagers to the Outer Planets

With Pixel Pusher we could never get past messages something like
This file has no PDS label please fill in the following info
a bunch of slots with most zeros  Yet we could open the
image file in Word and see the label file at the beginning

The compressed image format used for the Voyager disks is not yet
supported by any Macintosh display software that I know of However
there does exist a program that can convert the images to a format that
is recognized by recent versions of both Pixel Pusher and NIHImage It
is called PDS Decompress and is available via anonymous ftp from the
pub directory on delcanomitedu  This is a Binhex
Stuffit archive and contains the application itself ThinkC source
and a very brief description

The most recent version of NIHImage  may be downloaded from
starhawkjplnasagov where it is located in imagehqx in the
pub directory This archive also contains source code but not the
documentation which is located in the imagehqx archive in the
same directory

                      LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics

               Orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists 
          CLAIM to be looking for a Unified Field Theory in which all 
          of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single 
          set of laws or equations  But they have been systematically 
          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for  years 

               The late Physicist Dewey B Larson's comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe which he 
          calls the Reciprocal System is built on two fundamental 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of 
          space and time 
    
                The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component MOTION existing in THREE dimensions in DISCRETE 
          UNITS and in two RECIPROCAL forms SPACE and TIME 
    
                The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics its magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN 
    
               From these two postulates Larson developed a COMPLETE 
          Theoretical Universe using various combinations of 
          translational vibrational rotational and vibrational
          rotational MOTIONS the concepts of INward and OUTward 
          SCALAR MOTIONS and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light 
          which Larson called UNIT VELOCITY and THE NATURAL 
          DATUM 
      
               At each step in the development Larson was able to 
          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the 
          REAL physical universe photons subatomic particles 
          INCOMPLETE ATOMS charges atoms molecules globular star 
          clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white 
          dwarf stars pulsars quasars ETC even objects NOT YET 
          DISCOVERED THEN such as EXPLODING GALAXIES and GAMMARAY 
          BURSTS 
          
               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom 
          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter
          atomic distances in crystals and molecules compressibility 
          and thermal expansion of solids and other properties of 
          matter 

               All of this is described in good detail withOUT fancy 
          complex mathematics in his books

               The following is a complete list of the late Physicist

          should be available via interlibrary loan if your local 
          university or public library doesn't have each of them 

               Several of them INCLUDING the last one are available 
          from The International Society of Unified Science ISUS 
           E Atkin Ave Salt Lake City Utah    This is the 
          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory  
          They have other related publications including the quarterly 
          journal RECIPROCITY 

          

          Physicist Dewey B Larson's Background
    
               Physicist Dewey B Larson was a retired Engineer 
          Chemical or Electrical  He was about  years old when he 
          died in May   He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
          Engineering Science from Oregon State University  He 
          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE 
          chemical properties based only on the elements used 
    
               Larson's lack of a fancy PHD degree might be one 
          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is 
          NOT A VALID REASON  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider 
          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES  At the same 
          time it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX 
          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer 
          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS AD HOC 
          ASSUMPTIONS PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE INCONSISTENCIES ETC 
     
               Larson did NOT have the funds etc to experimentally 
          test his Theory  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so  
          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER 
          researchers' experimental and observational data  And in 
          many cases HIS explanation FIT BETTER 
    
               A SELFCONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX 
          physicists and astronomers have  They CLAIM to be looking 
          for a unified field theory that works but have been 
          IGNORING one for over  years now 
    
               Modern physics does NOT explain the physical universe 
          so well  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of 
          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who 
          agree  And remember that epicycles crystal spheres 
          geocentricity flat earth theory etc ALSO once SEEMED 
          to explain it well but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG 
    
    
               Prof Frank H Meyer Professor Emeritus of UWSuperior 
          wasis a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory and was or 
          still is President of Larson's organization THE 
          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE and Editor of 
          their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY  He moved to 
          Minneapolis after retiring 
    


          Super Collider BOONDOGGLE
          
               I am AGAINST contruction of the Superconducting Super 
          Collider in Texas or anywhere else  It would be a GROSS 
          WASTE of money and contribute almost NOTHING of scientific 
          value 
    
               Most physicists don't realize it but according to the 
          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist 
          Dewey B Larson as described in his books the strange GOOFY 
          particles mesons hyperons ALLEGED quarks etc 
          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders Fermi Lab 
          Cern etc are really just ATOMS of ANTIMATTER which are 
          CREATED by the highenergy colliding beams and which quickly 
          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible 
          with their environment 
    
               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a 
          few more elements of antimatter that the physicists have not 
          seen there before and the physicists will be EVEN MORE 
          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW 
    
               Are a few more types of antimatter atoms worth the  
          BILLION cost  Don't we have much more important uses for 
          this WASTED money 
    
     
               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed 
          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some 
          kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground 
          cables  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water 
          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of 
          the Supercollider 
    
          
               Naming the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon as 
          proposed is TOTALLY ABSURD  If it is built it should be 
          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST 
      


          LARSONIAN AntiMatter
          
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe antimatter is NOT a simple case of 
          opposite charges of the same types of particles  It has more 
          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the 
          photons of which they are made in relation to the 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light 
          which Larson calls Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum 
     
               In Larson's Theory a positron is actually a particle of 
          MATTER NOT antimatter  When a positron and electron meet 
          the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their 
          respective photons of which they are made neutralize each 
          other 
      
               In Larson's Theory the ANTIMATTER half of the physical 
          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME and ONLY ONE dimension 
          of space and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our 
          MATERIAL half 
       


          LARSONIAN Relativity
          
               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury 
          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the 
          rate of  seconds of arc per century   seconds of this 
          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational 
          perturbations from the other planets Venus Earth Jupiter 
          etc  The remaining  seconds of arc are being used to 
          help prove Einstein's General Theory of Relativity 
    
               But the late Physicist Dewey B Larson achieved results 
          CLOSER to the  seconds than General Relativity can by 
          INSTEAD using SPECIAL Relativity  In one or more of his 
          books he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH 
          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury 
    
               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED General Relativity as another 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY  He also REJECTED most of Special 
          Relativity including the parts about mass increases near 
          the speed of light and the use of the Lorentz Transform on 
          doppler shifts Those quasars with redshifts greater than 
           REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME 
     
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe there are THREE dimensions of time instead 
          of only one  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured 
          from our material half of the physical universe  The one 
          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time  At low 
          relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are 
          NEGLIGIBLE but at high speeds they become significant and 
          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR 
          Larson often used the term COORDINATE TIME when writing 
          about this 
    
     
               In regard to mass increases it has been PROVEN in 
          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near 
          the speed of light  But the formula for acceleration is 
          ACCELERATION  FORCE  MASS a  Fm  Orthodox physicists 
          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR FORCE  In Larson's Theory 
          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero  FORCE is 
          actually a MOTION or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS or RELATIONS 
          BETWEEN MOTIONS including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS  
          The expansion of the universe for example is an OUTward 
          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of 
          the socalled Big Bang which is yet another MATHEMATICAL 
          FANTASY 
    
                                    
          
          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION

               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book THE UNIVERSE 
          OF MOTION by Dewey B Larson  North Pacific 
          Publishers PO Box  Portland Oregon    
          pages indexed hardcover 
    
               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL 
          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that 
          author an UNrecognized GENIUS more than thirty years ago 
    
               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical 
          mysteries including the FORMATION of galaxies binary and 
          multiple star systems and solar systems the TRUE ORIGIN of 
          the degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma
          ray bursts and the TRUE NATURE of quasars pulsars white 
          dwarfs exploding galaxies etc 
    
               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL 
          looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with 
          OPEN MINDS 
    
               The following is an example of his Theory's success 
          In his first book in  THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL 
          UNIVERSE Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING 
          GALAXIES several years BEFORE astronomers started finding 
          them  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's 
          comprehensive Theory  And when QUASARS were discovered he 
          had an immediate related explanation for them also 
    

 
          GAMMARAY BURSTS

               Astrophysicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about the mysterious GAMMARAY BURSTS  They were 
          originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the 
          disc of our galaxy  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in 
          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions 
          uniformly and their source locations in space do NOT 
          correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of 
          directional coincidence 
    
               Gammaray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B Larson  According to page  of 
          his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION published in  the 
          gammaray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the 
          ANTIMATTER HALF of the physical universe which Larson calls 
          the Cosmic Sector  Because of the relationship between the 
          antimatter and material halves of the physical universe and 
          the way they are connected together the gammaray bursts can 
          pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at 
          random  This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do 
          not correspond with known objects and come from all 
          directions uniformly 
    
               I wonder how close to us in space a source location 
          would have to be for a gammaray burst to kill all or most 
          life on Earth  There would be NO WAY to predict one NOR to 
          stop it 
    
               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past which 
          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were 
          actually caused by nearby GAMMARAY BURSTS 
    


          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation
          
               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the 
          vicinity of the sun are binary or double  But orthodox 
          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory 
          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them 
    
               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY 
          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of 
          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey 
          B Larson 
    
               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation which is 
          detailed in Chapter  of his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION 
          and in some of his other books 
    
               First of all according to Larson stars do NOT generate 
          energy by fusion  A small fraction comes from slow 
          gravitational collapse  The rest results from the COMPLETE 
          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements heavier than IRON  Each 
          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT  The heavier the 
          element is the lower is this limit  A star's internal 
          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and 
          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually 
          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and 
          lighter elements 
    
               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the 
          destructive temperature limit of IRON there is a Type I 
          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION  This is because there is SO MUCH iron 
          present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms 
          and the atom building process which Larson explains in some 
          of his books better than I can 
    
               When the star explodes the lighter material on the 
          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less 
          than the speed of light  The heavier material in the center 
          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to 
          the speed of light because of the high temperature  The 
          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light and 
          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME which is equivalent to INWARD IN 
          SPACE and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while 
    
               Over long periods of time both masses start to fall 
          back gravitationally  The material that had been blown 
          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star  The 
          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a 
          WHITE DWARF star  BOTH stars then start moving back toward 
          the MAIN SEQUENCE from opposite directions on the HR 
          Diagram 
    
               The chances of the two masses falling back into the 
          exact same location in space making a single lone star 
          again are near zero  They will instead form a BINARY 
          system orbiting each other 
     
               According to Larson a white dwarf star has an INVERSE 
          DENSITY GRADIENT is densest at its SURFACE because the 
          material at its center is most widely dispersed blown 
          outward in time   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about degenerate matter neutron 
          stars black holes etc 
    


          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation

               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the 
          exploding star is relatively SMALL then instead of a single 
          white dwarf star there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf 
          stars revolving around the red giant star but probably 
          still too far away in threedimensional TIME to be affected 
          by its heat etc  These will become PLANETS 
      
               In Chapter  of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION Larson used all 
          this information and other principles of his comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe to derive 
          his own version of Bode's Law 
          


          Black Hole FANTASY

               I heard that physicist Stephen W Hawking recently 
          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO black 
          holes merging together into a SINGLE black hole and 
          concluded that the new black hole would have MORE MASS than 
          the sum of the two original black holes 
    
               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED 
          FLAG causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of black 
          holes etc 
    
               After reading Physicist Dewey B Larson's books about 
          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe especially his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION it is 
          clear to me that black holes are NOTHING more than 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES  The strange object at Cygnus X is 
          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR NOT the black 
          hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want 
          to prove their theory 
    
    
               By the way I do NOT understand why so much publicity is 
          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking  The physicists and 
          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical 
          problem somehow makes him wiser  It does NOT 
    
               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist 
          Dewey B Larson while he was still alive  Widespread 
          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's 
          Theory books and organization The International Society of 
          Unified Science 
          
          
          
          ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPULSION

               I heard of that concept many years ago in connection 
          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors but I never was able to 
          find out how or why they work or how they are constructed 
    
               I found a possible clue about why they might work on 
          pages  of the book BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B Larson which describes part of 
          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe  I quote one paragraph 
    
               As indicated in the preceding chapter the development 
          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally 
          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance  
          The electrons we find are derived from the environment  It 
          was brought out in Volume I Larson's book NOTHING BUT 
          MOTION that there are physical processes in operation which 
          produce electrons in substantial quantities and that 
          although the motions that constitute these electrons are in 
          many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities 
          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are 
          limited  It follows that there is always a large excess of 
          free electrons in the material sector material half of the 
          universe most of which are uncharged  In this uncharged 
          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension 
          space because they are inherently rotating units of space 
          and the relation of space to space is not motion  In open 
          space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently 
          in the same location with respect to the natural reference 
          system in the manner of a photon  In the context of the 
          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron 
          like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by 
          the progression of the natural reference system  All 
          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons 
          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation  
          Meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later 
          whereby electrons are returned to the environment  The 
          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth 
          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level 
          
               Note that in Larson's Theory UNcharged electrons are 
          also massLESS and are basically photons of light of a 
          particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning 
          around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate  
          Unit velocity is the speed of light and there are 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light 
          according to Larson's Theory  I might have the above and 
          below labels mixed up 
    
               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass
          LESS UNcharged electrons flying around at the speed of 
          light 
    
               If this is true then the ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPULSION 
          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these 
          electrons or other particles in space perhaps GIVING them a 
          charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to 
          achieve propulsion In Larson's Theory an electrical charge 
          is a onedimensional rotational vibration of a particular 
          frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the 
          rotation of the particle 
      
               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to 
          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is 
          generated in clouds 



          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics

               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B Larson has 
          been available for more than  YEARS published in  in 
          his first book THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE 
    
               It is TOTALLY UNSCIENTIFIC for Hawking Wheeler Sagan 
          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call 
          science or physics or astronomy etc as well as 
          the scientific literature and the education systems to 
          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have 
    
               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many 
          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such 
          as gammaray bursts and the nature of quasars 
    
               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY 
          discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals 
          in the US and elsewhere  And at least the basic principles 
          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses 
          at UWEC UWMadison Cambridge Cornell University and 
          elsewhere so that students are not kept in the dark about a 
          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed 
    
          

               For more information answers to your questions etc 
          please consult my CITED SOURCES especially Larson's BOOKS 



               UNaltered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this 
          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff  Do you know

Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans  It
doesn't take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large
gas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster all of which
would have far better costeffectiveness

Henry I made the assumption that he who gets there firstest with the mostest
wins 

Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it since the
prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort  You can
spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches

What's more if you buy Titans the prize money is your entire return on
investment  If you develop a new launch system it has other uses and
the prize is just the icing on the cake

I doubt very much that a billiondollar prize is going to show enough
return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current
US launchers  There would surely be a buyAmerican clause in the rules
for such a prize since it would pretty well have to be governmentfunded
You're going to have to invest your front money in building a new launch
system rather than pissing it away on existing ones  Being there first is
of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it

 could I get a couple of CanadARMs tuned for the lunar environment  I
wanna do some teleoperated prospecting while I'm up there

I'm sure Spar would offer to develop such a lunartuned system and deliver
a couple of them to you for only a couple of hundred million dollars

there be a large static electricity build up around the puncture

George William Herbert sez

Hmm   billion lesse I can probably launch  tons to LEO at
 million in five years which gives about  tons to the lunar
surface oneway  Say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its
fuel a bigger Mercury or something might get that as low as two
tons leaving fifteen tons for a oneman habitat and a year's supplies
Gee with that sort of mass margins I can build the systems off
the shelf for about another hundred million tops  That leaves
about  million profit  I like this idea   Let's see
if you guys can push someone to make it happen  

I like your optimism George  I don't know doots about raising that kind
of dough but if you need people to split the work and the M you just
give me a ring   Living alone for a year on the moon sounds horrid but
I'd even try that if I got a bigger cut

   On April  a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
  hours its planned value during this mission phase

 This activity is regularly reported in Ron's interesting posts Could
 someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is

The name is rather descriptive  It's a command to the spacecraft that tells
it If you don't hear from Earth after  hours assume something is wrong
with your the spacecraft attitude and go into a preprogrammed search mode
in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth

The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other
Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft and if everything is fine
there's no reason to send it any new information  But from the spacecraft's
point of view no information from Earth could mean either everything is
fine or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition  Just how long
should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and
begins to take corrective action  That how long is the command loss timer
During relatively inactive cruise phases the command loss timer can be set
to rather long values  In this case Earth is telling Galileo expect to
hear back from us sometime within the next  hours

I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the
event and the r law  So if the r law is incorrect assume
some unknown material dark matter inhibits Gamma Ray propagation
could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
events happening much closer to us  The even distribution could
be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
being shorter then  the thickness of the disk of the galaxy

        To the North Pole

        On June  and   two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON 
    rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan 
    Republic  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe 
    for the planet Venus 

        Designated VENERA  and  the probes were meant not for landing
    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the
    planet in detail from orbit  To accomplish this task the basic
    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas  The central bus core
    was made one meter  inches longer to carry the two tons of
    propellant required for braking into orbit double the fuel carried by
    the VENERA  and  orbiters eight years earlier  Extra solar panels
    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large
    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging  The
    dishshaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger 
    to properly transmit this information to Earth 

        Atop the buses where landers were usually placed were installed
    the  by meter  by foot kilogram pound
    POLYUS V sidelooking radar antennae  The radar system possibly a
    terrainimaging version of the nuclearpowered satellites used by 
    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance would be able to map Venus'
    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers  to  miles 

        The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over
    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter which could reveal objects 
    no smaller than  kilometers  miles in diameter  And while the
    VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations 
    made by the meter foot Arecibo radio telescope on the 
    island of Puerto Rico the orbiters would be examining the northern
    pole of Venus  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or 
    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially 
    interesting geological features worthy of investigation

        On October   after an interplanetary journey of  
    million kilometers  million miles and two midcourse corrections 
    VENERA  fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a 
    polar orbit  by  kilometers  by  miles around 
    the planet completing one revolution every twentyfour hours  VENERA 
     followed suit four days later  The twin probes thus became Venus' 
    first polarcircling spacecraft

        Radar operations began on October  for VENERA  and October  
    for VENERA   For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north
    pole the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface  kilometers 
    ninety miles wide and nine thousand kilometers  miles long  
    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over 
    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back 
    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth  Each strip of information took 
    eight hours to process by computer  By the end of their main missions 
    in July of  the VENERAs had mapped  million square kilometers 
     million square miles thirty percent of the entire planet

        VENERA  and  revealed that Venus has a surface geology more
    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late s  Numerous hills 
    mountains ridges valleys and plains spread across the landscape 
    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the 
    last one billion years  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean 
    surface rather young  Hundreds of craters were detected as well the 
    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites planetoids 
    would be a better term here at least fourteen kilometers  miles 
    across due to Venus' very dense atmosphere

        There were some disagreements between US and Soviet scientists
    on the origins of certain surface features  For example the probes' 
    owners declared that the kilometer mile wide crater at the 
    summit of meter foot high Maxwell Montes the tallest 
    mountain on the planet was the result of a meteorite impact  American 
    scientists on the other hand felt the crater was proof that Maxwell 
    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern continent of Ishtar Terra  

        In any event the US decided to wait on making verdicts about
    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe scheduled for later
    in the decade  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar
    VOIR its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig
    nated the Venus Radar Mapper VRM  Eventually the machine would be 
    called MAGELLAN after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan 
    circa   This vehicle would map the entire planet in even 
    finer detail than the VENERAs  For the time however the Soviet 
    probes maintained that distinction

        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs  Bolted
    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the 
    Fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measuring the world's
    temperatures  The majority of the areas covered registered about
    five hundred degrees Celsius  degrees Fahrenheit but a few
    locations were two hundred degrees hotter possibly indicating 
    current volcanic activity  The probes also found that the clouds 
    over the poles were five to eight kilometers three to  miles 
    lower than at the equator  In contrast the polar air above sixty 
    kilometers thirtysix miles altitude was five to twenty degrees 
    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights

        When the main mapping mission ended in July of  there were 
    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at 
    more southernly latitudes  Unfortunately this idea did not come to 
    pass as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitudecontrol
    gas to perform the operation  

        VENERA  and  ceased transmission in March of  leaving 
    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six 
    hundred kilometers  miles of radar data tape to sort into an 
    atlas of twentyseven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus

        Venus by Balloon

        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting 
    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of 
    air with balloonborne instruments  Professor Jacques Blamont of 
    the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales CNES
    had proposed such an idea as far back as  only to have a joint 
    FrenchSoviet balloon mission canceled in   Nevertheless 
    late in the year  such dreams would eventually come true

        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December  and  
    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear full 
    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe 
    since   This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission

        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named
    VEGA  and  a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI  Gallei
    being the Russian word for Halley  Not only did the spacecraft 
    have more than one mission to perform they also had more than one 
    celestial objective to explore namely the comet Halley  

        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to 
    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 
    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from
    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago scientists 
    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such 
    bodies which actually come close to Earth  

        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar 
    system  Some like Halley are perturbed by various forces and fall 
    in towards the Sun where they circle for millennia spewing out ice 
    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar 
    encounter

        The Soviet Union along with the European Space Agency ESA and
    Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science ISAS did not
    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a
    close examination of Halley  The ESA would be using the cylindrical
    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the 
    comet while Japan's first deep space craft  SAKIGAKE Pioneer and 
    SUISEI Comet  would view Halley from a much safer distance 

        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet
    from the vantage of a space probe at one time envisioning a vessel
    powered by solar sails or ion engines  However government budget
    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts  The US would have to
    make do primarily with Earthbased observations and the sharing of 
    data from other nations though an instrument named the Dust Counter 
    and Mass Analyzer DUCMA designed by Chicago University Professor 
    John Simpson was added on the Soviet mission in May of 

        The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs  Instead of building
    an entirely new craft for the mission the Soviets decided to modify
    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an 
    advanced Venus mission along the way  As VEGA  and  reached Venus
    the buses would drop off one landerballoon each and use the mass of 
    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley much as the 
    US probe MARINER  used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier 
    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley helping to pinpoint the 
    location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive 
    in only  kilometers  miles away in March of 

        As planned the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of   VEGA
     released its payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander
    making a twoday descent towards the planet  The craft touched the
    upper atmosphere on the morning of June   Sixtyone kilometers
     miles above the Venerean surface a small container was released
    by the lander which produced a parachute at  kilometers  miles
    altitude  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had
    successfully arrived 

        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute helium gas was
    pumped into the Tefloncoated plastic balloon inflating it to a
    diameter of  meters  feet  Dangling on a tether thirteen
    meters  feet below was the instrument package properly known as
    an aerostat  The top part of the kilogram pound aerostat
    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment
    point to the balloon  Beneath it was the transmitter electronics
    and instruments  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for
    measuring cloud particles  The aerostat was painted with a special
    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which
    permeated the planet's atmosphere 

        The VEGA  balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just
    north of the equator  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag 
    would burst in the heat of daylight so they placed it in the darkened 
    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data  
    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as 
    well effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions  
    The author wonders though if they could have used floodlights similar 
    to the ones attached to VENERA  and  in  when Soviet scientists 
    had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight 
    due to the permanently thick cloud cover

        The first balloon transmitted for  hours right into the day
    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed covering 
    kilometers  miles  The threat of bursting in the day heat did
    not materialize  The VEGA  balloon was stationed at a kilometer
    mile altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers
    thirty miles for this was considered the most active of the three
    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in   Indeed the
    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to  kilometers
     miles per hour  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and
    down two to three hundred meters  to  feet through most of the
    journey  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius
     degrees Fahrenheit and pressure was a mere  Earth atmosphere
    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds 

        Early in the first balloon's flight the VEGA  lander was already
    headed towards the Venerean surface  Both landers were equipped with
    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA  
    and  in   However VEGA  would become unable to report the
    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia the
    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra  While still ten to fifteen
    minutes away from landing a timer malfunction caused the drill to 
    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers  
    miles above the surface 

        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before
    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing  This was unfortunate not
    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of
    Venus was covered with such smooth lowlevel lava plains and had never 
    before been directly examined  Nevertheless the surface temperature 
    and pressure was calculated at  degrees Celsius  degrees 
    Fahrenheit and  Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's 
     minutes of ground transmissions  A large amount of background 
    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site

        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA  and 
     had failed in December of  the Soviets focused on the data
    returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere  The
    FrenchSoviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur chlorine 
    and possibly phosphorus  It is the sulfur  possibly from active 
    volcanoes  which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color
    The Sigma  gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air
    between an altitude of  and  kilometers  and  miles
    contained one milligram  grain of sulfuric acid

        The VEGA  data on the overall structure of the cloud decks 
    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS
    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 's results
    nearly matched its twin  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers 
    instead of the three reported by the US probes  The layers were 
    three to five kilometers  to  miles thick at altitudes of  
    and  kilometers  and  miles  The clouds persisted like a
    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of  kilometers  miles 
    much lower than the PV readings  One possibility for the discrepan
    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air 
    over the last seven years

        When the lander and balloon finally went silent the last 
    functioning part of the VEGA  mission the flyby bus sailed on
    for a  millionkilometer  millionmile journey around
    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley  On March
      the bus made a kilometer mile pass at the 
    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space
    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial
    bodies with one space vessel

        On June  VEGA  released its landerballoon payload for
    a twoday fall towards Venus  Like its duplicate the VEGA 
    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking
    it on Earth for  hours before battery failure on the morning
    side of the planet  During its kilometer mile
    flight over Venus the second balloon entered in a rather still
    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission
    After  hours mission time the air became even more turbulent 
    for a further eight hours  When the balloon passed over a five
    kilometer threemile mountain on the continent of Aphrodite 
    Terra a powerful downdraft pulled the craft  kilometers  
    miles towards the surface

        Temperature sensors on the VEGA  balloon reported that the air 
    layer it was moving through was consistently  degrees Celsius 
     degrees Fahrenheit cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 
    balloon  This was corroborated by the VEGA  lander as it passed 
    through the balloon's level  No positive indications of lightning
    were made by either balloon and the second aerostat's nephelometer 
    failed to function

        The VEGA  lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite
    Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June  kilometers 
    miles southeast of VEGA   The lander's resting place was smoother
    than thought indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a
    relatively young one covered in fresh lava  The soil drill was in
    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthositetroctolite 
    rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands  This rock is rich in 
    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium  A high degree 
    of sulfur was also present in the soil  The air around VEGA  measured 
     degrees Celsius  degrees Fahrenheit and  Earth atmospheres
    essentially a typical day or night on Venus

        Far above the VEGA  lander its carrier bus sped past Venus at
    a distance of  kilometers  miles and followed its twin 
    to comet Halley making a closer flyby on March   at just  
    kilometers  miles  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet 
    is a very dark and irregularshaped mass about fourteen kilometers 
     miles across rotating once every  hours give or take three 
    hours

        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley
    encounters Soviet scientists considered an option to send the 
    probes to other celestial objects  One prime target was the near
    Earth planetoid  Adonis which VEGA  could pass at a distance 
    of six million kilometers  million miles  Sadly the Soviets 
    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly 
    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was 
    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned  
    VEGA  and  were quietly shut down in early 

        Future Plans Diverted

        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous 
    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second 
    world from the Sun  One example was the VESTA mission planned for
    the early s

        This SovietFrench collaboration called for the launch of multiple 
    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either  or   The craft 
    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon 
    probes  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's 
    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over 
    the VEGA balloons' two days  The mission would then head out to 
    investigate several planetoids and comets including a possible 
    landing on Vesta thus the mission name the most reflective Main 
    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth

        Unfortunately for Venus exploration plans began to change in
    the Soviet Union  In  the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA
    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus keeping the comet
    and planetoid aspects intact  By this time in the Soviet space 
    program interest was focusing on Mars  Already under construction 
    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS  Two members of this 
    class were planned to leave Earth in  and orbit Mars the next 
    year  PHOBOS  and  would then place the first instruments on
    Mars' largest moon Phobos 

        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions
    including balloon probes rovers soil sample return craft and 
    eventually human explorers in the early TwentyFirst Century
    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious
    consideration of human colonization in the near future

        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars
    exploration  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions
    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in  and the other
    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon
    landing in March of  

        In  a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to
    ten penetrators around the planet in   Several years later the
    mission launch date was moved to the year  and has now been put 
    on indefinite hold  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have
    since been put forth a sad commentary after twentyfive years of
    continuous robotic exploration of the planet 

        During the late s a drastic political and economic change
    was taking over the Soviet Union  President Mikhail Gorbachev began 
    to open up his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with 
    the rest of the nations particularly those in the West  While the 
    culture became less oppressive than in the past the economy was taking 
    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a free market

        These effects hit everywhere including the space program
    Missions at all levels were cut back  The Soviets began making
    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other spacefaring
    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to 
    make money  

        In early  it was reported that the Soviets were offering for 
    sale several fullyequipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price 
    of  million dollars each an incredibly low price for any planetary 
    probe  No nation took them up on the bargain  Meanwhile the United 
    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own

        MAGELLAN and GALILEO 

        The US reactivated their longdormant planetary exploration
    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May  
    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft a combination of
    spare parts from other US probes designed to make the most 
    detailed and complete radarmapping of Venus in history  When
    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of  it would be
    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 
    meters  feet surpassing the abilities of VENERA  and 

        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space 
    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit 
    the giant planet Jupiter in   On October   the Shuttle 
    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space 
    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the 
    probe's primary target's major moons in 

        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on
    a direct flight to the Jovian planet the probe was sent around
    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach
    Jupiter  As a result Venus became GALILEO's first planetary
    goal in February of   The probe radioed back images of the
    planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in
    that violent atmosphere

        On the Drawing Boards

        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years
    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus  Scien
    tists in the US have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet 
    Union  now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January  
      of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions 
    within in the next decade  Japan India and the ESA have also
    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades

        In February of  NASA came up with several new Venus projects 
    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes
    throughout the solar system  For Venus two missions were selected
    for further study  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing
    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds air
    temperature and pressure and the Venus Composition Probe designed
    to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air
    with the aid of a parachute much as the Soviets had done since 
    Final project decisions will be made in 

        Humans on Venus      

        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus
    At present the leadmelting temperatures and crushing air pressure
    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something
    even tougher than a VENERA lander  Plans have been looked into
    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like
    Earth's  However it should be noted that any such undertaking
    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide 
    atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability 
    to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster
    than once every  Earth days  Such a project may take centuries
    if not millennia

        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand
    Venus as its exists today  We still have yet to fully know how
    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became
    instead such a deadly place  Will Earth ever suffer this fate
    Perhaps Venus holds the answers  Such answers may best be found
    through international cooperation including the nation which 
    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus

Having read in the past about the failsafe mechanisms on spacecraft I had
assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function  However I
always find disturbing the oxymoron of a NOOP command that does something
If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
a NOOP command

Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has
nothing to do with jet propulsion

Actually both numbers are correct  The difference is in the direction
of the acceleration  For pilots accelerations tend to be transverse to
the direction you're facing pulling out from a steep dive the
acceleration will force blood toward your feet for instance  In this
case you can only put up with about  g's even with a pressure suit  

The record for acceleration though is measured along the direction
you're facing for lack of a better term  As I recall this record
was set in rocket sleds back in the 's  and was about  g's or so

lan

Apart from the fact that you get G in the pullout not the dive that
figure is about right for sustained G no protection
The duration of G it's rate of onset body position and support aids are
all critical parts of the equation I remember one note about instrumented
gridiron players recording peaks about G Stapp the aviation doctor
either by accident or design took a shortperiod G in a rocketsled
decelleration eyeballsout against a standard 's harness It had
to be short calculate the stopping time even from   mph at that
G A bangseat can get up to about  G and you'd better be sitting
straight Find the book by MartinBakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
it can get if the rate of onset is too high A reclining position and a
good Gsuit can keep a pilot functioning at around G

A flotation tank should be a good bet since you can treat the body as a
fluid and highpressure situations are not new Anyone have any figures

     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution
crudely speaking indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution

How can you tell the difference between an intensity distribution which
is due to an edge in the spatial distribution and an intensity
distribution which is due an a sharp dropoff of intrinsic luminosities
below a certain threshold  Could you describe roughly what the
intensity distribution is like

    A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland
    on April  At  UT two people saw a bright luminous
    pillarshaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near
    Mikkeli The head of the pillar was circular The lower part
    was a little winding It was like a monster they told They
    were little frightened Soon the yellowish pillar became
    enlarged A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle
    of the phenomenon At last the light landed behind the nearby
    forest Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were
    visible till morning sunrise

    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in
    Lappeenranta At  UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in
    the low northeastern horizont The altitude of the trail was
    only about  degrees Soon the trail began to grow taller
    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail It was like a
    spoon This lasted only  seconds Now the altitude was about
    five degress above horizont He noted a bright spot at the
    upper stage of loop The spot was at magnitude  The loop
    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of
    the loop A cartwheelshaped trail was appeared round the bright
    spot After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails
    were only visible in the low horizont Luminous trails were still
    visible at  UT in the morning sky

    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket I don't know if
    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near
    Arkhangelsk but this may be a rocket experiment too Since 
    we have observed over  rocket phenomena in Finland Most of
    these are rocket experiments military missile tests barium
    experiments and other chemical releases During these years we
    have observed  satellite launches

      Hmmm I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record
players and radios in the s wasn't better performance but lower
perunit cost than vacuumtube systems

I'd buy that for two reasons  The tubes for TV's and radios if you can
still find them are usually x or more expensive than comparable transistors

Also ask any electricguitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer and
they'll tell you tubetype since tubes have lower distortion and noise
than transistors  'Course most of your electric guitar types just say
Tubes sound better dude 

Also transistors have the advantage in both wasteheat and energyuse
mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes

 If all of these things have been detected in space has anyone
 looked into possible problems with the detectors
 
 That is is there some mechanism cosmic rays whatever that
 could cause the dector to think it was seeing one of these
 things
 
 Graydon
 
 That would not explain why widely separated detectors such as on Ulysses
 and PVO and Ginga et al would see a burst at the same time  In fact be
 fore BATSE having this widely separated Interplanetary Network was the
 only sure way to locate a random burst  With only one detector one cannot
 locate a burst except to say It's somewhere in the field of view  With
 two detectors one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector
 to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky  With three detectors
 one gets intersecting annuli giving two possible locations  If one of these
 locations is impossible because say the Earth blocked that part of the 
 sky voila you have an error box
 
 BATSE by having  detectors of its own can do its own location determination
 but only to within about  degrees would someone at GSFC like David like
 to comment on the current state of location determination  Having inde
 pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty
 
 You did touch on something that you didn't mean to though  Some believe
 in a reference that I have somewhere that absorptionlike features seen
 in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector  It would be
 a mean nasty God though that would have a NaI crystal act like a  Gauss
 neutron starbut this is getting too far afield
 
 Peter
 peterfoddjobuchicagoedu
 

        All of this is VERY valid and very true  But to add to this
explaniation each individual detector also has a built in failsafe just so
the detector does not read the background radiationie cosmic rays 
if I remember right the detectors go off about  to  sigma above the 
background  This is so they don't catch particularly energetic cosmic rays
that would normally set it off Even with this buffer they still have to throw
out something like  of the bursts that they DO get because of the Earth's
Van Allen Belts the South Atlantic Anomaly the Sun  if I remember right
there is either a radar station or a radio station in Australia and there are
a couple other sources as well

   Finally this isn't the Bronze Age 
   please try to remember that there are more human activities than
   those practiced by the Warrior Caste the Farming Caste and the
   Priesthood

F Baube responds
   Right the Profiting Caste is blessed by God and may
    freely blare its presence in the evening twilight 

  Steinn Sez
  The Priesthood has never quite forgiven
  the merchants aka Profiting Caste sic
  for their rise to power has it

If we are looking for evidence of belessedbyGodness I'd say the ability
to blare lights all over the evening sky is about the best evidence you
could ever hope to get  No wonder the preistly classes are upset

 If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic would absorption from the

 How much energy does a burster put out  I know energy depends on
 distance which is unknown  An answer of the form X ergs per
 megaparsec is OK
 
 
 
     John Carr jfcathenamitedu
        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this
little problem  I don't have a calculator but I DO have the problem set that
we did not too long ago so I'll use that and hope it's what you wanted  
This is a highly simplified problem with a very simple burst  Bursts are
usually more complex than this example I will use here
        Our burst has a peak flux of E ergs cm sec and a duration
of  seconds  During the frst second of the burst and the last  seconds
its flux is half of the peak flux  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the
time  Assume that the background flux is E erg cm sec
        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst for several
different spheres RpcOort Cloud Radius Rpcat the edge of the
galaxy Rpc or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a
RMpc  
        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence then used the
old standby formula
                        LuminositypirFpeak
        For a radius of  pc we found an L around  ergsec  Pretty
energetic for close by  for the coronal model we found around  ergsec
And lastly for the cosmological model an L That's what you'd call
moderately energetic I'd say  Any suggestions about what could put out that
much energy in one second

Question what is the power spectrum of the bursts Are their sharp lines
If so can they be interpreted as blueshifted atomic or molecular lines

Can electronpositron annihilation gammas be seen in the bursts Are they
red shifted or blue shifted

Since the bursts are isotropic and maybe in the galactic halo they may
be saying something about dark matter in the halo

If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation from
way back then where are the red shifts  I mean cosmological red shifts

Consider a wild idea  what if the bursts are advanced photons from the
future rather than retarded ones from the past Would advanced photons
from far future when universe was considerably more expanded get
blue shifted as they propagate to younger states of the universe

catalog  These tests all  show that the bursts have an isotropic
distributionevenly spread out in a radial direction and they show signs of
homogeneity ie they do not clump in any one direction  So unless we are
sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy we are sampling the UNIVERSE
Not cool if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things  Now I
suppose you are saying Well we stil only may be sampling from inside the
disk  Well not necessarily  Remember we have what is more or less an
interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out
to beyond Plutopioneer  so we should be able with all of our detectors de
tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite  Here's an 
analogy  You see a plane overhead  You measure the angle of the plane from
the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system  One of your friends a mile
away sees the same plane and measures the angle from the zero point of his
arbitrary system which is the same as yours  The two angles are different
and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe
find a source  To my knowledge no one has been able to do this  

Uh no These burst detectors are just that burst detectors
They have no angular resolution

Now a network of burst detectors could have angular resolution
but we do not have a decent set of different networks at the distances
neccesary from each other to determine if they're happening in the oort
cloud or not

We have one network and trying to make two networks out of it
degrades what angular resolution we have

          Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress
                          The Next Step
                          
        The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase 
Act is introduction of the Act in Congress At this point  many
congresspersons have been approached about the bill However
for a successful effort to pass the bill we need the best
possible congressperson to introduce the bill Due to his
position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science
Congressman George Brown is the logical choice He has a long
record of support and interest in space development and helped
pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements
Act                      
        There is a small group of activists in southern California 
who have assisted George Brown in his recent reelection campaigns
We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown
about the Back to the Moon bill We are also asking prospace
constituents to let him know that they care about getting
America back to the Moon
        Finally there is a good chance that a nationwide alert 
for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him
introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late
spring 
        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's
office As more is known it will be passed on
        However even if we are successful in getting him to support
the bill  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill For
any bill to become law one of three conditions must exist
either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an
issue such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits be
propelled by highpriced lobbyists we're out of luck there or
have widespread support within Congress due to small but
widespread constituent support The latter is the path that we
by necessity must choose                    
        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources 
Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number
of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill  To accomplish
this we need activists to ask their congressperson to support
the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act  now To wait until the
bill is introduced is simply too late  it takes time to have a
congressperson's staff review a bill
        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet
introduced please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently
written We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists
and politicians
        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill please
request a copy by Email please include your US postal service
address or contact your local chapter of the National Space
Society

 Apart from the fact that you get G in the pullout not the dive that

 it can get if the rate of onset is too high A reclining position and a

Wm Hathaway comments
I'd like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for
research activities by professional astronomers  Some of what I
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics  Many readers may
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine  sacred 
unsullied by the actions of humans  The space between the stars
as profoundly black as an abyss can be  With full horizons and
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time
 none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man
Any lights were supplied solely by nature uncorruptable by men
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there
and becoming immortal as the stars whether by apotheosis or a belief
in an afterlife

The Space Age changed all that  more on man's effect on the environment

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't
fouled in some way
 I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved

I agree that the desire for beauty is valid but I think your desire to
impose your vision of beauty is not  You mention the ageold desire to
somehow get up there but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment
of that vision  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky not impeded
by the effects of humans but ignore the beauty of the asdarkascanbe
sky that is only visible from space a vision that we or at least
our descendents may one day be able to see in part because of efforts
that others call ugly  One day I hope humans will be able to look out
not upon half the heavens with only naturecreted lights but upon all
of the heavens with no lights  If advertising in space can help us reach
that goal it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it than the
'pristine' sky of yesteryear or yestercentury which is totally
unreachable  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern
sculpture was a human form in the effort of striving to reach a goal
I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that
just because it has changed the way we strive

BTW there are places that people haven't fouled  Sometimes they make
it better

A young French skeptic who reads skeptically the UFO review OVNI
Presence OP sent me the following excerpt from an August 
issue of this review RG  Robert Galley French minister of
defense in  answering about the Belgian UFO wave

OP  Can you conceive that the US could allow themselves to send
 their most modern crafts over foreign territory with the Belgian
 hierarchy ignoring that 
RG  Absolutely  The best proof which I can give is that some time
 ago without informing the French authorities the US based in
 Germany sent a plane to make photos of Pierrelatte  We followed
 this plane and after its landing on the Ramstein airport Colonel X
 got back the shots of Pierrelatte The US had not informed us
 There is an important military plant of enrichment of uranium at
Pierrelatte Drome

What kind of plane could it be  Surely not an SR which our planes
could not follow and still can't

I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans
I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
of physical aspects of the planet  The question is what physical aspects
simply disallow earth like conditions

eg Temperature range of K to K where temp is purely dependant on dist
     from the sun and the suns temperature
   Atmospheric presure   I know nothing of human tolerance
   Planetary Mass   again gravity at surface is important how much
     can human bodies take day after day  Also how does the mass effect
     atmosphere  I thinking of planets between  and  times mass of the
     earth  I suppose density should be important as well

Climate etc does not concern me nor does axial tilt etc etc  Just the above
three factors and how they relate to one another

jfc If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic would absorption from the
jfc galaxy be expected  How transparent is the galactic core to gamma
jfc rays

and later
 Jim Batka  JBATKADESIREWRIGHTEDU  said

JB So if the r law is incorrect assume
JB some unknown material dark matter inhibits Gamma Ray propagation
JB could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
JB events happening much closer to us  The even distribution could
JB be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
JB being shorter then  the thickness of the disk of the galaxy


 

 Well maybe not zero but very little  At the typical energies for 
 gamma rays the Galaxy is effectively transparent 

 Hans Bloemen had a review article in Ann Rev Astr Astrophys a few 
 years back in which he discusses this in more depth

 Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges   
 
   David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic
'edged' distribution to whit they are either part of the Universe or
part of the Oort cloud

Why couldn't they be Earth centred with the edge occuring at the edge
of the gravisphere I know there isn't any mechanism for them but there
isn't a mechanism for the others either

   Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled
Habitable Planets for Man I think in   It should be available
in most good libraries or through interlibrary loan

   It answered the questions you ask speculatively of course along
with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies
length of day for daynight temperature variation and agricultural
concerns partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses ever hear of
xenon narcosis  neither did I density of particulates in the atm and
their composition ever hear of silicosis  not much fun etc

   Climate isn't a global phenomenon and probably needn't concern you
but axial tilt ought to  It plays a large part in determining the
severity of seasonal differences and a lesser but still significant
part in determining the speed of prevailing winds

 Don't remember the spectra but have seen some autocorrelation functions
 recently  The ACFs show correlation times of milliseconds to s of 
 seconds interestingly the higher energies show a shorter correlation 
 time

js red shifted or blue shifted

 I believe there were claims from an earlier satellite Ginga of 
 detection of cyclotron absorption lines  These lines were taken as 
 strong evidence for neutron stars being the objects responsible for 
 GRBs since the magnetic field indicated was E fairly typical

 If the bursts are in the halo they most certainly are saying something 
 about dark matter there  However if they are in the halo in order 
 that they appear isotropic the core radius of the halo ie the

 The halo itself would stretch much further than this  Since the 
 Andromeda Galaxy is only  kpc away we should be seeing bursts
 from that galaxy's halo which we aren't

js If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation from
js way back then where are the red shifts  I mean cosmological red shifts

 Remember to get a redshift one needs some type of emission or 
 absorption line so one can compare the observed line frequency 
 to the rest line frequency  Since no lines are seen in GRB spectra 
 that comparison cannot be made

had to send the women to a lower altitude when they were pregnant in order
to insure sucessful childbirth

Another factor you should consider is the Xray opacity of the atmosphere 
in case of stellar flares the uv opacity is also important because uv 
radiation can kill or damage microbes plants and animals

The following is what they feed to us most has been posted already
but there are a number of items not seen here yet

Redesign Activities Update  Following is the weekly status on redesign
based on information provided by NASA headquarters

The station Redesign Team SRT provided a detailed status report to the
Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April   The
daylong meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City VA topics
covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for
the space station science technology and engineering research the
assessment process and the design approach Discussions on management
options and operations concepts also were held

The Design Teams then presented the three options under study

 Option A  Modular Buildup  Pete Priest presented the A option Priest
said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has
identified three distinct phases of evolution  power station human tended
and permanent presence The team will define the minimum capability needed
to achieve each phase the total cost of each phase and the achievable
capability for budget levels The A option uses current or simplified
Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing
systems such as the socalled Bus spacecraft the orbiter and Spacelab

The Power Station Capability could be achieved in  flights with Freedom
photo voltaic modules providing  kW of power day ShuttleSpacelab
missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase

Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the US
Common Module Module which adds subsystems and  payload racks and docking
ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories day missions with the orbiter
docked to the station are assumed for this phase Different
operationutilization modes are being studied for this phase

 Option B  Freedom Derived  Mike Griffin presented the status of Option
B activities Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedomderived option
from initial Research Capability to HumanTended Capability to Permanent
Human Presence Capability to Two Fault Tolerance and finally Permanent
Human Capability Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the
baseline program with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking
system Crew Health Care System and ECLSS and a major change to the Data
Management System

Initial Research Capability would be achieved with  flights to  degree
inclination  flights to  degrees and consist of an extended duration
orbiterSpacelab combination docked to a truss segment with  photo voltaic
arrays providing  kW of power

HumanTended Capability would be achieved in  flights and add truss
segments and the US lab

Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in  flights with two
orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return

Two Fault Tolerance achieved in  flights would build out the other
section of truss with another set of PV modules thermal control and
propulsion systems

The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete
state with  flights  Three more flights to bring up the habitat module
a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles ACRV would complete
the Permanent Human Capability with International stage

Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware
would not by itself meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived
option  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including
program management contractor nonhardware early utilization and
operations costs he said

 Option C  Singe Launch Core Station  Chet Vaughn presented Option C
the Single Launch Core Station concept  A Shuttle external tank and solid
rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit  Shuttle
main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch
and jettisoned after ET separation

The module  feet in diameter and  feet long would provide 
cubic feet of pressured volume separated into  decks connected by a
centralized passageway  Seven berthing ports would be located at various
places on the circumference of the module to place the international
modules and other elements  This can would have two fixed photo voltaic
arrays producing approximately  kW of power flying in a solar interial
attitude

In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee Bryan O'Connor
said a design freeze would be established for the  options on April  so
that detailed costing of the options can begin  The next meeting with the
Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 

Russian Consultants Arrive in US  A delegation of  Russian space
experts arrived in the US on April  and briefings to the SRT by members
of the Russian team began on the nd  The group includes Russian Space
Agency General Director Y M Koptev and V A Yatsenko also of the RSA 
Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense
the Design Bureau SALYUT the Institute of Biomedical Problems the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH  The Russian team
briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system docking
systems the Proton launch vehicle Mir operations and utilization and the
Soyuz TM spacecraft

The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities
of the Mir space station and the possible use of Mir and other Russian
capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign  They will
be available to the SRT through May 

Management and Operations Review Continues   Work continued in the SRT
subgroups  The Management Group under Dr Walt Brooks is working to
develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a
foundation for the transition to development and operations  Various
management options have been developed including

 Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of
command

 Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate
Administrator

 Skunk WorksDedicated Program Office with a small dedicated colocated
handpicked program office

 Combine Space Station with Shuttle with the space station becoming an
element of the current program

 Major Tune Up to Current Organization with current contracts and
geographical distribution maintained but streamlined

The Operations Group under Dr John Cox is building on the work of the
Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASAJSC which had
already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its
preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible

As part of its work  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency
experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of
assembly and operations utilization maintenance and logistics and testing
and ground operations

What's in the Week Ahead  The Design Support Teams will provide a
comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday
and Tuesday at which point the design will be frozen to begin the
detailed cost assessment   Also this week the team will begin preparing
for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee to
be held May 

Dr Shea Steps Down   Dr Joe Shea stepped down as director of the
Station Redesign Team on April  and Bryan O'Connor will take over the
activities of the team  Dr Shea submitted his resignation as assistant
deputy administrator for space station analysis but will continue to serve
as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to
consult with the SRT Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request
from Dr Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated

Key Milestones  The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being
carried on the schedule are

April 
Design Freeze on Options for Costing

April 
Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT

May 
Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee

May 
Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee

Summary Gamma Ray Bursts are still a mystery
Keywords GRBs  cyclotron lines  cosmological bursts
Inreplyto sarfattinetcomcom's message of Tue  Apr   GMT

 On Tue  Apr   GMT sarfattinetcomcom Jack Sarfatti said

js Question what is the power spectrum of the bursts Are their sharp lines
js If so can they be interpreted as blueshifted atomic or molecular lines

 Don't remember the spectra but have seen some autocorrelation functions
 recently  The ACFs show correlation times of milliseconds to s of 
 seconds interestingly the higher energies show a shorter correlation 
 time

js Can electronpositron annihilation gammas be seen in the bursts Are they
js red shifted or blue shifted

 I believe there were claims from an earlier satellite Ginga of 
 detection of cyclotron absorption lines  These lines were taken as 
 strong evidence for neutron stars being the objects responsible for 
 GRBs since the magnetic field indicated was E fairly typical 
 for a neutron star  However Compton GRO has not seen any of these 
 lines and I get the impression that many are beginning to doubt whether
 these lines were ever real

js Since the bursts are isotropic and maybe in the galactic halo they may
js be saying something about dark matter in the halo

 If the bursts are in the halo they most certainly are saying something 
 about dark matter there  However if they are in the halo in order 
 that they appear isotropic the core radius of the halo ie the 
 innermost region of the halo has to be greater than about  kpc
 The halo itself would stretch much further than this  Since the 
 Andromeda Galaxy is only  kpc away we should be seeing bursts
 from that galaxy's halo which we aren't

js If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation from
js way back then where are the red shifts  I mean cosmological red shifts

 Remember to get a redshift one needs some type of emission or 
 absorption line so one can compare the observed line frequency 
 to the rest line frequency  Since no lines are seen in GRB spectra

Also ask any electricguitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer and

Of course  they then  turn up the REverb the Gain  add in the analog
delay line  and the Fuzz box  I'd think they wouldn't notice the

Also transistors have the advantage in both wasteheat and energyuse

Ah  but how do they compare to Mechanical systems

In CnACnewscsouiucedu George F Krumins writes
I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers
have the right to a dark uncluttered night sky
  Sorry you have a wish for an uncluttered night sky but it
isn't a right When you get down to it you actually have no rights
that the majority haven't agreed to give you and them in the process
It's a common misconception that being born somehow endows you with
rights to this that and the other Sadly this is not true
  Now if you want to talk about the responsibility that should go with
the power to clutter the night sky then that's a different matter
 
Greg Nicholls           Vidi
nichovnetibmcom or      Vici
nichoolympusdemoncouk  Veni

According to this reasoning there are no rights at least none that I can think 
of

Let's see  Do I have a right to unpolluted air  No because the majority
drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process

Do I have the right to clean water  I guess not by the same reasoning
I could go on with these examples for a long time

Look at Nazi Germany  Because of the majority Jews homosexuals blacks
and others that were different had no rights  In fact they were terrorized 
imprisoned and slaughtered  In this country did blacks have the right to be
free from slavery  I guess not because the majority said that slavery was 
good for them

I think that a right has a moral imperative  If a law imposed by the majority
is immoral one should not follow it  In fact one should do everything in
hisher power to stop it Of course that doesn't mean that I would lose all
common sense to break the law just because I thought it was immoral  I pay
my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the US Government
taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism
This is precisely the point I am trying to make  We should persude people 
by logic pointing out that it is in their selfinterest to let all have
equal rights in all aspects of life including adequate housing food and
medical care  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of
beauty and joy is also necessary  That is why I consider an uncluttered
night sky a right

Have you ever been out in the desert away from local lights and most people
The sky is dark and transparent  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail
than you thought possible  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away

Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto say in LA Due to light pollution
you have never seen a dark sky  You might in fact never not in your whole
life ever see the majesty of the night sky  Every where around you you see
squalor and through your life runs a thread of dispair What is there to live
for  

I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples but I have seen both
I for one need dreams and hopes and yes beauty as a reason for living
That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right

Reboost may not be a problem if they have enough fuel  If they don't do a 
reboost this time they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing
mission  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
back and you could have problems  The shuttle just isn't designed to land 
with that much weight in the payload

 Is it because two shuttle flights would be required adding to the alredy
 horrendous expense
 

of course that is a concern too and the loss of science during the time
that it is on the ground  plus a fear that if it comes down some
bigwig might not allow it to go back up  but the main concern I
believe is the danger of the landing  Just to add another bad vibe
they also increase the risk of damaging an instrument  Finally 
this is a chance for NASA astronanuts to prove they could build and
service a space station  Hubble was designed for in flight servicing

bringing the telescope down to my understanding was considered
even very recently but all these factors contribute to the 
decision to do it the way it was planned in the beginning

Subject Re Vandalizing the sky


My apologies if this is a repost  I submitted it on Friday but 
got a message that my post might not have gone out  Considering 
the confusing spitting contest over 'rights' there are TOO 
inalienable rights damn it  The majority can be just as destructive 
of liberty as a despot I suspect that my post did not get out 
of my site    I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these 
rights although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them 



Anyway here are my thoughts on this 


I'd like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine  sacred  
unsullied by the actions of humans  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
 none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature uncorruptable by men  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife  

The Space Age changed all that  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo etc on this view could only happen once  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome  even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky 

Yes I know aircraft are almost always in sight  I have to live 
in a very populated area  miles from an international airport 
currently where light pollution on the ground is ghastly  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here  virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped sculpted modified trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans cockroaches and squirrels 
or rats  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend getting away from it all paved roads indoor plumbing 
malls  and it felt good for a while  then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles   
miles to the east  Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic  So I know the skies are rarely perfect 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way  I mean they've been TRYING this forever  
like concerning Tesla's idea to banish night  wow  I don't watch 
commercial television but I can imagine just how disgusting beer 
truck or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high  
If ya' gotta make a buck on it displaying products in heaven at 
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life  

To be open about this though I have here my listing of the passage 
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend  tonight Friday at 
 pm EDT it will reach an altitude of  degrees on the 
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity  I'll be trying to see it 
if I can  it is my mealticket after all  So I suppose I could 
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky 
while complaining about billboards proposed by others  Be that 
as it may I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid 
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved 

Regards 
Wm Hathaway 
Baltimore MD 


PS added Tuesday  this again is not a rightsvsreality tome 
just a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know 
that other people may not accept it without a complaint

Having read in the past about the failsafe mechanisms on spacecraft I had
assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function  However I
always find disturbing the oxymoron of a NOOP command that does something
If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
a NOOP command

Using your argument the NOOP operation in a computer isn't a NOOP since it
causes the PC to be incremented

Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has
nothing to do with jet propulsion

Of course the complaint comes from someone who hasn't a clue as to what he's
talking about

   I didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently I
just wanted to add a point

   The whole question of a right to a dark sky revolves around the
definition of a right  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and
good but as far as I can see a right is whatever you or someone
representing you can enforce  In most civilizations the government or
the church or both defines what the rights of the citizens are and
then enforces those rights for them  Here in the US the constitution
provides a Bill of Rights from which most if not all legal rights are
considered to derive  I'm sure that most other countries have
comparable documents  If you can persuade a court that you have a right
to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights in the
US you can prevent maybe these billboards from being launched  To
keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law
and the International Court of Justice correct name in the Hague
something I know little about

The European Space Agency has involvement with remote earth 
observation and I presume this includes surveillance optical etc
So it's not just the USUSSRex who are in the game

But what is the game What can be done with space observation
The military functions of missile spotting troop spotting etc are well
documented but what about anything else

The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a
paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals

More importantly if radar can spot water vapour clouds presumably
a radar based sat will be capable of spotting riversopen water and 
underground water from space This would be a positive life saver
for African or other drought affected countries Implementing a
clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such
countries and should cut down mortalities considerably

So how about it Is there a charity or government agency that would
pay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits
mapped

Or is this still scifi

Mail replies would be great

Mr Hathaway's post is right on the money if a little lengthy  In short
an orbiting billboard would be trash in the same way that a billboard on
the Earth is trash  Billboards make a place look trashy  That is why there
are laws in many places prohibiting their use  The light pollution
complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain
on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky

Regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect since they are
more like abstract entities but a billboard in space would be like a beer
can somebody had thrown on the side of the road just trash

Come on this is scispace  An orbital billboard won't
do any permanent damage in a few years it will reenter
and probably hit Los Angles anyway 

The boost to space commerce orbital advertising might
provide might speed the day it is possible for those with a 
yen for dark skies to get some really dark skies beyond
the dust producing the zodiacal light 

Now if they wanted to paint the CocaCola symbol on the
moon in lampblack that would give me pause  It would
be very difficult to reverse such a widespread application

      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away

    Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are
    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by

    Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges   

      David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic
   'edged' distribution to whit they are either part of the Universe or
   part of the Oort cloud

   Why couldn't they be Earth centred with the edge occuring at the edge
   of the gravisphere I know there isn't any mechanism for them but there
   isn't a mechanism for the others either

What on Earth is the gravisphere
Anyway before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter
had a gamma ray detector as does Ulysses they 
detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors
do so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances
In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would
see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin

The problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
no plausible mechanism has been proposed It would have
to involve new physics as far as I can tell Closest to
conventional Oort sources is a model of Bfield pinching
by comets it's got too many holes in it to count but at
least it was a good try

Subject Words from the Chairman of Boeing on SSTO type stuff

  Yesterday I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting  It was a bit shorter
than I expected  Last year when the stock was first down they made a big
presentation on the  and other programs  This year it was much more
barebones

In any case I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would
hear and so I got there early and figured that If I didn't get to the mike
maybe they would read mine off of a card and so I wrote it down and handed it
in

After the meeting started Mr Shrontz said that he would only answer written
questions in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only
had monitors downstairs  Naturally I was crushed

So when question and answer time came I was suprised to find my question
being read and answered  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took
Presumably getting there early and getting the question in early made all
the difference

So on to the substance The question was 

Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport such
as a commercial space launch system and if not how will Boeing compete
with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed
by Mcdonnell Douglass

Well he read it without a hitch and without editing with impressed me
then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question last
part first

This is to the best of my recollection what he said

As far as single stage to orbit technology we think that we have a better
answer in a two stage approach and we are talking to some of our customers 
about that  As far as commercialization that is a long ways off  The High
speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at
this point

So this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a noncommercial
arena and for the most part this is true however it also tells me that 
they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them
to persue work on their own

Now I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing  Actually
this is a misnomer as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this
guy is doing however he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space
lifter contracts  He won't tell me what he is doing but maybe this is where
the TSTO action is taking place at boeing  At the very minimum the chairman
of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind and they are
trying to do something with it  

Anybody know anything further
Is this really news
Does this threaten further work on DC

Although the  billion scheme is a fantasy it's an old canard in the space
business called trolling for billionaires there is a good chance that a
much smaller program  million will pass the rd Congress This is the
Back to the Moon bill put together by the people who passed the Launch
Services Purchase Act The bill would incent private companies to develop
lunar orbiters with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding
There is an aggregate cap on the bids of  million
 
Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably
worse than having the government bankroll a  million program as the Delta
Clipper program has shown DCX was funded by SDIO at  million We have a
clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade  as opposed to
simply wishing for our dreams to come true Please support the Back to the
Moon bill

    I didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently I

 then enforces those rights for them  Here in the US the constitution
 provides a Bill of Rights from which most if not all legal rights are
 considered to derive  I'm sure that most other countries have

These seem hardly like the groups to discuss this in but HUH 
All legitimate power to enforce these rights derives from the consent 
of the governed not from no steenkin' piece of paper  Civilized gov'mnt 
is not an autonomous computer program it's interactive  The Constitution 
was made by the people and can be trashed by us  it ain't no sacred 
scripture from which rights flow  Our 'rights' come from our souls 
And I sure didn't see any request to vote on trashing the sky  
Again  my opinion only  we keep our rights by using them not going to 
some court  

 comparable documents  If you can persuade a court that you have a right
 to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights in the
 US you can prevent maybe these billboards from being launched  To
 keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law
 and the International Court of Justice correct name in the Hague
 something I know little about

Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it since the
prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort  You can
spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches

Fine I'll buy from George GEORGEEE

That assumes I can't weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort cut me a
break on the launcher I'll cut you in on the proceeds if it works  Only the
government pays higherthanlist price 

What's more if you buy Titans the prize money is your entire return on
investment  If you develop a new launch system it has other uses and
the prize is just the icing on the cake

Unless you're Martin Marietta since as I recall they bought out the GD line
of aerospace products 

If MMGD does it as an inhouse project their costs would look much better
than buying at list price  Does anyone REALLY know the profit margins built
in to the Titan  C'mon Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
or that 

I doubt very much that a billiondollar prize is going to show enough
return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current
US launchers  

Oh please  How much of a profit do you want  Pulling  million after
all is said and done wouldn't be too shabby  Not to mention the other goodies
I'll collect in

	a  Movie  TV rights say  million conservatively
	b  Advertising       Look Mommie they're drinking Coke
	c  Intangibles	      Name recognization experience  data 
				acculumated

You're going to have to invest your front money in building a new launch
system rather than pissing it away on existing ones  Being there first is
of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it

If you want lean fine  A  million prize would be more than adequate for a
prize

Maybe Wales would be kind enough to define what a company would consider
a decent profit

If you want RD done you'll have to write in RD clauses  I suppose you could
make it a SBIR setaside

Better yes but we're not talking order of magnitude  Especially if you
want to use Titan IV which belongs to the USAF not MM

 C'mon Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
or that 

Sure you can get a heavylift launcher fairly cheap if you do it privately
rather than as a gummint project  But we're still talking about something
that will cost nine digits per launch unless you can guarantee a large
market to justify volume production

clear since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance 
rather than space surveillance 

     What I meant was not which countries use satellites to look at 
the Earth satellite reconnaissance  but was which countries have 
programs to detect and track ie determine the orbital elements of 
satellites as they pass overhead space surveillance 

    The US uses missiledefense radars supplemented by a fascinating 
quasiradar operated by the Navy to do this for satellites in LEO and 
electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above  km or so 
The FEE I understand does much the same thing 

    Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs binoculars stopwatches 
and PCs for objects out to around  km enabling them to keep track 
of satellites for which ah official element sets aren't available 
See the fascinating books by Desmond KingHele for details as well as 
the files in the molczan directory on kilroyjplnasagov  The 
material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in 
optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree and it may be 
that other countries do also 

    Which was the question I meant to ask who are they how do they do 
it and why do they do it

 Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a exmilitary 
 establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection 
 of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of 
 the Buran shuttle system  They are located near the NPO Energia 
 facility in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow 

If this facility is in Kaliningrad this is not near Moscow

Correction and some more info The Kaliningrad that Mr Larrison
writes about is indeed near Moscow I've read that it may also be known by
the name Podlipk and is a short distance from Zvezdny Gorodok Star 
City and the Cosmonaut Training Center there I read that the Tsniimach
Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building est  
Enterprise was also responsible for creating the NKIK Ground Command and 
Measurement Complex including the Kaliningrad Flight Control Center
which has controlled all SovietRussian manned spaceflights since its
completion in  However it appears to have been a part of the 
Ministry of General Machine Building which was not part of the military

radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups  If I
remember things correctly the models involved contributions from three
different BB sources so there's no obvious temperature of background
radiation in our local area

Indeed the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully
enough in particular its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a
bit higher than you would see from a black body  MorganGordon's fat
Communications Satellite Handbook has a graph of sky temperature vs
wavelength in fact for communications design

However in terms of energy content the RF frequencies are negligible
For thermal purposes at very large distances from the Sun the sky
looks like a black body at K Allen Astrophysical Quantities
I haven't found a number for nonlarge distances since solar radiation
tends to be something you can't just ignore  but MG says about K
in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem

          Book Review
          
          
          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION by Dewey B Larson  North 
          Pacific Publishers Portland Oregon  pages indexed 
          hardcover 
          

               THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to 
          most ALL astrophysical mysteries 
          
               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged 
          edition of THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE   
          Volume I is NOTHING BUT MOTION  and Volume II is 
          THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER  
          
               Most books and journal articles on the subject of 
          astrophysics are bristling with integrals partial 
          differentials and other FANCY MATHEMATICS  In this book by 
          contrast mathematics is conspicuous by its absence except 
          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text  
          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical 
          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual 
          validity 
          
               Dewey B Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor 
          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State 
          University  He developed the Theory described in his books 
          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the 
          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements 
          they contain 
          
               THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION describes the astrophysical 
          portions of Larson's CONSISTENT INTEGRATED COMPREHENSIVE 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe a kind of 
          grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and 
          astrophysicists CLAIM to be looking for  It is built on two 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of 
          space and time 
          
                The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component MOTION existing in THREE dimensions in DISCRETE 
          units and with two RECIPROCAL aspects SPACE and TIME 
          
                The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics its primary magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN 
          
               From these two postulates Larson was able to build a 
          COMPLETE theoretical universe from photons and subatomic 
          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies by combining the 
          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with 
          translational vibrational rotational and rotational
          vibrational motions  At each step in the development he was 
          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with 
          corresponding parts in the real physical universe including 
          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED  For example in his  
          book he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES 
          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them  They 
          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory  And 
          when quasars were discovered he had a related explanation 
          ready for those also 
          
               As a result of his theory which he called THE 
          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the 
          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists 
          including black holes neutron stars degenerate matter 
          quantum wave mechanics as applied to atomic structure 
          nuclear physics general relativity relativistic mass 
          increases relativistic Doppler shifts nuclear fusion in 
          stars and the big bang all of which he considered to be 
          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES  He was very 
          critical of the AD HOC assumptions uncertainty principles 
          solutions in principle no other way declarations etc 
          used to maintain them 
          
               THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION is divided into  chapters  
          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from 
          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters 
          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that 
          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in 
          from the ANTIMATTER HALF of the physical universe  Galaxy 
          formation from the MYTHICAL big bang is a big mystery to 
          orthodox astronomers  He then goes on to describe life 
          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and 
          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of 
          SINGLE stars 
          
               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which according 
          to Larson are denselypacked clusters of stars that have 
          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies 
          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
          although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME 
          
               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against 
          observations that contradict their theories would find 
          Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an 
          OPEN MIND  For example they used to believe that GAMMA RAY 
          BURSTS originated from pulsars which exist primarily in the 
          plane or central bulge of our galaxy  But the new gamma ray 
          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from 
          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any 
          visible objects except for a few cases of directional 
          coincidence  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray 
          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTIMATTER 
          HALF of the physical universe which Larson calls the cosmic 
          sector  Because the antimatter universe exists in a 
          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe with the speed 
          of light as the BOUNDARY between them and has THREE 
          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space the 
          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly 
          at random 
          
               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from 
          books journal articles and leading physicists and 
          astronomers  In this book  of them are superscripted 
          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the 
          end of the book  For example a quote from the book 
          Astronomy The Cosmic Journey by William K Hartmann 
          says Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if 
          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars 
          form Unfortunately we cannot  Larson's book contains 
          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are 
          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists 
          astronomers and astrophysicists 


               For more information answers to your questions etc 
          please consult my CITED SOURCES Larson's BOOKS 


               UNaltered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this 
          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED

Mike Adams suggested discussions on longterm effects of spaceflight
to the human being  I love this topic as some of you regulars know

So having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk
about it I shall

I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources
to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate
on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent 
as medical intensive care agriculture environmental protection and 
probably more  I do not believe that the general public understands
the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society  In the absence
of such knowledge we see dwindling support of the world's space effort

I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only
communicate amongst ourselves but also with others through print media

A wellorchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science
variables required to support longduration spaceflight like long
expenditions to the moon or Mars would be entertaining and educational
to the general public  The objective of such an effort would be to 
compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical
journals which would address each major life science area  In addition
ideas for further research and development could be put forward for
the general public to ponderallowing the general public to take
part in the excitement of exploration

Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week
to running literature searches and finding journal articles  In addition
we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls
of NASA and industry

I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally
eager to start this project  Perhaps we could start with debate regarding
how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application
to spaceflight

BATSE by having  detectors of its own can do its own location determination
but only to within about  degrees would someone at GSFC like David like
to comment on the current state of location determination  Having inde
pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty
 

Well I'll avoid your question for now got some learnin' to do with a
promise to come back with more info when I can find it  I do know that
BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the allsky map of
longterm sources  Given that fact and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
of approx  arcmin we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can
determine the location rotational of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge
of the allsky map's accuracy  PR material for the other three instruments
give accuracies on the order of fractions of a degree if that's 
any help

Speaking of GRO the networld probably was happy to see that the preps
for orbit adjust appear to be going well  Our branch guy who's helping
out says that things have gone smoothly with the isovalve preps and the
burns will take place in midJune

Anyway I'm off to find out more  'Be back when I get some info

ANNOUNCEMENT	The HyperKnowledge PROJECT for NeXTSTEP

Motivation

We are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our  
work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by  
incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages too often  
claiming to do everything  Rather than being able to use different tools  
together in a flexible interactive system we find ourselves spending too  
much time converting between different data formats writing throwaway  
tools and IO parsers and worrying about how to get to a particular goal  
rather than what it means to have attained it

What we need is an objectoriented scientific environment where the tools  
we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system  
highly interactive and extendable both by the addition of our own  
specialized objects and by combining the available tools  graphically   
The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work  
requiring a very short learning phase and practically no  
userdocumentation  The user should feel encouraged to explore different  
possibilities testing hisher own scientific ideas without worrying too  
much about whether the system is able to cope within reason of course   
By building an open and objectoriented system each user should be able  
to draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a  
particular task we all need to organize and archive our data display  
results and combine information from many different sources

Currently the group consists of people from very different fields  
Molecular Biology Computer Science Physics and Astronomy and Geography   
While many of our needs for such an environment diverge the underlying  
motivation is the same no matter what you want to call it we need a  
system which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific  
data and daily work


Why NeXTSTEP

What else is there  No other system offers the same power a totally  
objectoriented developers environment UNIXcompatibility  
highlyinteractive and standardized userinterface  With the advent of  
NS and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range  
of hardware platforms such a system will soon be nearly universally  
available  Classical workstation vendors SUN IBM HP and the rest now  
have little to offer no similar tools exist for the standard XWindows  
GUI if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware and the  
massmarket WindowsDOS world is a developer's nightmare either despite  
or more probably because of OLE

In order to progress we need an open discussion of how best to develop  
such an environment  In NeXTSTEP parlance do we simply have to put  
together a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our  
Hyperknowledge servers Should be use distributed objects  What  
minimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the  
environment  What toolneeds do we all have in common and which ones are  
best developed by specialized subgroups  How many already existing tools  
canshould be integrated into the system eg Mathematica  Do we need  
an AVSlike tool for dataflow manipulation

 Does anyone have a reference something I can look up not just your own
 recollections  I have a few of those myself on the temperature of the
 night sky as seen from space

     You'll find that in Allen CW Astrophysical Quantities Athlone
Press Dover NH rd edition pp    To the accuracy it can
be calculated see specific references in Allen about how it is
calculated the temperature is  degrees K

     Lots of people have remarked on this temperature  The first may have
been in Eddington's book Internal Constitution of Stars Ch  
reprinted  where he gives the temperature of space as  degrees

     The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight

 My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is
 substantially higher than that of the MBR once you figure in things like
 stars and the zodiacal light but I'd like numbers

     To the accuracy of measurement it's the same temperature  Some of us
think this may not be a coincidence  Tom

Well I seem to have struck an  interesting discussion off  Given that I
am not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist  i'll have to boil it
down a bit

  ALl the data on bursts to date  shows a smooth random distribution

  that means they aren't concentrated in  galactic cores our or someone
elses

 If the distribution is smooth  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLY
large phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomena
being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena
	OR
we are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud  but then it needs
some potent little energy source  that isn't detectable  by any other
current methods

  we know it's not real close  like  slightly extra solar  because
we have no parallax measurements on the bursts

  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or
super string  impacts or something like that

So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile

what i am wondering  is this in people's opinion  A NEW Physics problem

Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect   

Copernicus  started looking at  irregularities in planetary motion

Is this a big enough problem to create a new area of physics
just a little speculative thinking folks

      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away

    Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are
    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by

    Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges   

      David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic
   'edged' distribution to whit they are either part of the Universe or
   part of the Oort cloud

   Why couldn't they be Earth centred with the edge occuring at the edge
   of the gravisphere I know there isn't any mechanism for them but there
   isn't a mechanism for the others either

What on Earth is the gravisphere
Anyway before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter
had a gamma ray detector as does Ulysses they 
detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors
do so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances
In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would
see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin

The problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
no plausible mechanism has been proposed It would have
to involve new physics as far as I can tell Closest to
conventional Oort sources is a model of Bfield pinching
by comets it's got too many holes in it to count but at
least it was a good try

   This does not propose a mechanism for GRBs in the Oort and no
   antimatter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
   as I understand annihilation spectra Big difference
   That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
   known  in particular comet aphelia which are not well known
   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution

Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right
energy except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation
with galaxies or galaxy structure there is no mechanism for getting
all the energy out in gamma rays with any significant amount of
baryons around there will be a lot of pair production which makes a
plasma which thermalizes the energy it has trouble generating
enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts  ergs it
happens too fast compared to the burst duration and it is hard to
make tightbinaries of neutron stars

Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a
neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars but
that uses pretty farout physics

My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance so
GRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism so we can't
rule out the Oort cloud  What would be the spectrum of an event which
converts a comet to strange matter  The spectra for primordial black
holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets
aren't quite right but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which
modifies the spectrum  The energy matches very well for both of these
mechanisms  According to Trevor Weeks if the Tunguska Meteorite
was a miniblack hole collision with the earth then there are likely
to be enough miniblack holes around that the rate for BHcomet
collisions matches the GRB rate well

The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort
cloud isn't a reason to rule them out it makes it harder to rule them
out  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the
right distribution for the Oort cloud it is hard but not impossible
to match that up with the distribution of GRB's  If they got the
wrong distribution for the Oort cloud they can't constrain any Oort
cloud GRB's at all

Executive summary we don't know enough to rule out out the Oort
cloud

Given that fact and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
of approx  arcmin we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can
determine the location rotational of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge
of the allsky map's accuracy  PR material for the other three instruments
give accuracies on the order of fractions of a degree if that's 
any help
 
 But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here  The other x
 three instruments are focusing instruments that more or less form
 an image so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
 resolving power of the optics  BATSE is an altogether different
 beast effectively just  coincidence counters one on each corner of 
 the craft  Positional information is triangulated from the 
 differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors
 Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors
 and errors in craft attitude Since none of the  BASTE detectors have
 any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be used to
 determine parallax  Indeed parallax would just add a very small 
 component to the positional error  
 
 Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would 
 require resolution on the order of arcseconds since the oort 
 cloud is postulated to extend to about  parsec all together 
 now Parallax ARc SECond a parsec is the distance of an object 
 that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a  AU base line
 If the  degree accuracy reported above is true we're going to 
 have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline
 
 The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and
 watches the entire sky simultaneously a realy handy combination
 when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from
 
 Kevin
        Batse alone isn't always used to determine position  WHen a
particularly bright burst occurs There are a couple of other detectors that
catch it going off  Pioneer  or  is the one I'm getting at here  This
puppy is far enough away that if a bright burst happens nearby the huge
annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given
by BATSE and we can get a moderately accurate position Say oh  or 
degrees That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it  
        Actually my advisor another classmate of mine and me were talking
the other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites 
THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like 
pounds of eq  Well a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it and 
alone weighs about  pounds itself

        We decided against it

My guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost

why not  grapple  do all said fixes   bolt a small  liquid  fueled
thruster module  to  HST   then let it make the reboost  it has to be
cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug   that way now that
they are going to need at least   spacewalks  then they can carry
an EDO pallet  and  sit on station and even  maybe do the  solar array
tilt  motor  fix


	As Herny pointed out you have to develop the thruster
Also while much lighter you still have to lift the mass of
the thruster to orbit and then the thruster lifts its own 
weight into a higher orbit  And you take up room in the payload

 Note I am not talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background
 Radiation  There are more things in the sky than just the MBR what I'm

   Henry if I read you correctly you may be asking If I put a blackbody
in interstellar space 'disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'
what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient
radiation field

   If that's the case let me point out that interstellar dust and 
molecules provide many instances of things that are well nottoofar
from being blackbodies  Many different observations including IRAS
and COBE have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
can range from K to K  You might look in a conference proceedings

   could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
   events happening much closer to us  The even distribution could
   be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
   being shorter then  the thickness of the disk of the galaxy

I believe the problem with this theory is that we see gammaray
sources at that energy range and their energy doesn't seem to be
significantly absorbed

You should have heard Prof McNally  from my days as an astronomy
undergraduate denouncing photon pollution It was easy to imagine him
taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street
outside Mill Hill observatory with a gauge shotgun 

However seriously it is possible to limit the effects of
streetlights by adding a reflector so that the light only
illuminates the ground which is after all where you need it As a
bonus the power consumption required for a given illumination level
is reduced Strangely enough astronomers often seek to lobby elected
local authorities to use such lighting systems with considerable
success in the desert areas around the major US observatories At
least thats what McNally told us all those years ago
 British local authorities couldnt care less as far as I can see 

I suppose that the right to dark skies is no more than an aspiration
but it is a worthwhile one Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially
yukky and are presumably in the area of international law if any although
I do find the idea of a right to bear antisatellite weapons intriguing

You can do a whole hell of a lot better than  or  degrees with
the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network
Ignore the directional information from BATSE just look at the time
of arrival  With three detectors properly arranged one can often
get positions down to arc minutes

BTW about Oort cloud sources shouldn't this be testable in the
fairly near future  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times  
ms  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a
distance of on the order of bt c where b is the detector spacing
and t the time resolution  For t   ms and b   AU this is on the
order of  light years  I understand statistics will reduce this
number considerably as would geometry if the burst is coming from the
wrong direction

 I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for
 Humans  I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere
 evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet  The question
 is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions

This is a good question  There are major blind spots in our understanding
of what makes the earth habitable  For example why does the earth's
atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does  The naive
answer is photosynthesis but this is clearly incomplete  Photosynthesis
by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated as the oxygen produced
is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten  What is needed
is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of
the resulting reduced material

On earth this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic
matter mostly from oceanic sources  However this burial requires
continental sediments in the deep ocean the burial rate is so slow
that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered

This suggests that a planet without large oceans or a planet without
continents undergoing weathering will have a hard time accumulating
an oxygen atmosphere  In particular an allocean planet may have a
hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere

There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere
has been relatively stable over geological time for a period at least
 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O to
weathering in the absence of replenishment  No convincing feedback
mechanism has been identified  Perhaps the reason is the weak
anthropic principle if during the last  MYr or so the oxygen
level had dropped too low we wouldn't be here to be wondering about
it

    I didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently I
 just wanted to add a point
 
 
 then enforces those rights for them  Here in the US the constitution
 provides a Bill of Rights from which most if not all legal rights are
 considered to derive  I'm sure that most other countries have

These seem hardly like the groups to discuss this in but HUH 
All legitimate power to enforce these rights derives from the consent 
of the governed not from no steenkin' piece of paper

   We don't disagree on this  All I said was that a right is whatever
you or somebody acting for you can enforce  The Bill of Rights didn't
come into effect until it was ratified by the states and indirectly
the people from that point it defined legal rights  Common law
rights are vague and situational that's why the people insisted on a
Bill of Rights in the Constitution spelling out exactly what they
demanded from the government  Legitimate or illegitimate power is
power  That's why the federal government can force states to grant
their citizens rights they don't wish to In a slugging match the feds
win  Period

   And you're right this doesn't belong in scispace  I've said my
peace  No more frome me on rights at least not here

Most gracious regards

I have often thought about if its possible to have a powerfull laser
on earth to light at the Moon and show lasergraphics at the surface
so clearly that you can see it with your eyes when there is a new
moon

How about a Coca Cola logo at the moon easy way to target billions of
people

Do you know if its possible

 Mike Adams suggested discussions on longterm effects of spaceflight
 to the human being  I love this topic as some of you regulars know

 So having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk
 about it I shall

 I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources
 to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate
 on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent 
 as medical intensive care agriculture environmental protection and 
 probably more  I do not believe that the general public understands
 the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society  In the absence
 of such knowledge we see dwindling support of the world's space effort

Just a few contributions from the space program to regular society

	Teflon So your eggs don't stick in the pan

ps  To all the regular contributors to scispacenews and
scispaceshuttle thanks for all your hard work keeping us informed
as to the doings down in NASA and other spacetype agencies  I don't
have much time to read USENET but I ALWAYS read these two groups

    Hello All

  I apologize I haven't published my astro FTP list since March
  Now I haven't tested all the sites included into the list  I
  would notified all the people you have stored some older issues
  of my there are now lots of changes  Many sites have gone away
  They either do not exist any more or all the astro stuff have
  removed
 
  The job keep this list is very hard so all the notes and informat
  ion of changes new sites new contents etc is welcome

  I would thank all the net people who give me information for the
  newest version

 This  is  a  short  description  of  anonymousftp  file  servers  containing
 astronomy  and space research related material  I have  included only  those
 servers  where  there are  special subdirectories  for  astro stuff  or  much
 material  included into  a general  directories  This list is not a complete
 data set of possible places  so I would be very happy of all kind of notices
 and information depending on this listing

 The newest version of this file is available via anonymousftp as

 I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought 
 down for refurbishment  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting

Back in January and February there were several articles Wash Post Time
saying that NASA was considering the option just as it is now considering
a followup mission  months after the servicing mission  However the
down time was estimated to be a year servicing checkout sceheduling
and training another shuttle orbit verification and to be quite
expensive  I think it may have been more a mental exercise than a
real plan  Don't know

Much of Cook's later exploration was privately funded by Joseph Banks
among others eg in Resolution  the earlier Endeavour  Colnett's voyage
to the Galapagos was substantially privately funded by the owners of
British whaling vessels  Chancellor and Willoughby were privately funded
by London merchant companies in their voyages to Muscovy  The list is
almost endless  Those doing the funding were about eighty percent
motivated by potential profit ten percent by potential glory and ten
percent by the desire to advance the sum of human knowledge

 Are breathable liquids possible
 
 I remember seeing an old Nova or The Nature of Things where this idea was
 touched upon it might have been some other TV show  If nothing else I know
 such liquids ARE possible because
 
 They showed a large glass full of this liquid and put a white mouse rat in
 it  Since the liquid was not dense the mouse would float so it was held down
 by tongs clutching its tail  The thing struggled quite a bit but it was
 certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid  It never
 did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top
 
 Now this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations but it certainly
 shows breathable liquids can be made

to breath so maybe it is possible for a rat but not a human

Summary Ron Miller book on history of spaceships from Krieger Publishing
Keywords spaceships spacecraft astronautics history SF Miller

Ron Miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career  
I've admired both his paintings remember the USPS Solar System
Exploration Stamps last year and his writings on the history of
spaceflight  For several years he's been working on a big project
which is almost ready to hit the streets  A brochure from his
publisher has landed in my mailbox and I thought it was cool enough
to type in part of it it's rather long  Especially given the Net's
strong interest in vaporware spacecraft

                 

                         The Dream Machines
An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art Science and Literature

                            By Ron Miller
                  with Foreword by Arthur C Clarke

This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a
technological phenomenon  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the
space betwen worlds did not spring fullblown into existence in the
tlatter half of theis century  The need preceded the ability ot make
such a device by several hundred years  As soon as it was realized
that there were other worlds than this one human beings wanted to
reach them   

Tracing the history of the many imaginative and often prescient
attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of
technology science astronomy and engineering  Once space travel
became feasible there were many more spacecraft concepts developed
than ever got off the drawing board or off the ground for that
matter  These also are described in theis book for the same reason
as the prespaceage and preflight ideas are  they are all accurate
reflections of their particular era's dreams abilities and
knowledge  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since  as
well as selected events important in developing the idea of
extraterrestrial travel is listed chronologically  The chronological
entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and
speculative ventures  They also allow comparisons between
simultaneous events taking place in different countries  They reveal
connections influences and evolutions hitherto unsuspected  Every
entry is accompanied by at least one illustration  Nearly every
spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing  This
allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss to visualize
differences similarities and influences

This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history
and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic
diagrams   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and
historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating  The
unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and
very interesting history of the spaceship

SPECIAL FEATURES

Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft both real and
fictional

Contains scores of illustrations artwork drawings and photos
contemporary with the subject  This includes extremely rare
illustrations from scarce books and novels exclusive photos and
drawings fromSoviet spacecraft rare stills from both famous and
obscure science fiction films and unpublished photographs from NASA
archives

An index bibliography and appendices are included

   Henry if I read you correctly you may be asking If I put a blackbody

what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient
radiation field

Basically the right question although I was interested in cases closer
to home where the Sun is behind either a natural object or effective
shielding

   If that's the case let me point out that interstellar dust and 
molecules provide many instances of things that are well nottoofar
from being blackbodies
   Inside the disk of the galaxy the temperature varies quite a bit
from place to place

    If that's the case let me point out that interstellar dust and 
 molecules provide many instances of things that are well nottoofar
 from being blackbodies  Many different observations including IRAS
 and COBE have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
 can range from K to K  

Yes but that's because interstellar grains are very poor radiators not
remotely black bodies  As a consequence they are a lot warmer than the
ambient
 
    Inside the disk of the galaxy the temperature varies quite a bit

Actually would you need the shielding  My understanding is that it's
mostly there to give the detectors some directionality  No point in
doing that if you've only got one  I'm sure the burst detectors that

Mind you they're probably still too heavy  the PFF people would put
more Plutospecific instruments on first if they had any mass to spare

  That's Five Weeks In A Balloon  And if anyone can tell me where to
get it I sure would like a reply  I've been looking for that book for
TEN YEAR and never found it  Note that I am not looking for a 
collector's item I'm hoping that someone has published it in modern
times either in paperback or hardcover  I'm willing to spend  or
so to get a copy

I too am a Jules Verne collector and can tell you that though tough 
to find it is out there  I keep my eyes open all the time for his
books at various Bay Area used book stores and every once in a while
get very lucky  You just need diligence  I don't know if the book
store situation near JSC is as good as the Bay Area but good luck
I have also had excellent luck at the Antiquarian Book Fair which comes
to SF every other year though the prices are more in the  range
than the  you want to spend  My guess is that if you find it
you won't need to spend even that much since most people don't care 
about it  I think I paid about  for my dustjacketless but otherwise
good condition copy which I found one day at a small bookshop that happened
to have just bought a lot of random books at an estate sale  

Of course if you re willing to buy blind you can put a  advertisement
in the Antiquarian Bookseller's newsletter the exact title of which escapes
me at the moment  Five Weeks in a Balloon is not the rarest of Jules
Verne books  Someone has it for sale somewhere and the AB is the way to 
find it  In fact I would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers
of sale  Of course that takes the fun out of hunting for it yourself

Good luck

 I understand the when one is in orbit the inward force of gravity at
one's center of mass is exactly balanced by the outward centrifugal
force from the orbiting motion resulting in weightlessness

 I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like For example is
there a constant sensation of falling And what is the motion sickness
that some astronauts occasionally experience 

 Please reply only if you are either a former or current astronaut or 
someone who has had this discussion firsthand with an astronaut

 Is HST really that much heavier than a Spacelab 
 

I hate to belabor the obvious once again but if there had been an Orbiter
emergency in the early stages of the original HST deployment mission they
would have HAD to land with HST in the bay 

Indeed they were worried about that  One concern was the possibility that
they would lose a motor or something on the way up and make orbit but one
that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag  
I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was
as short as six months  In fact we got an excellent orbit on the upper
envelope of what the Shuttle can do

I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought 
down for refurbishment  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting
cleaning retesting and recertifying all the hardware on the ground in
addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment 
mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second 
time  And you would probably STILL need a third servicing mission in a 
few years as gyros and other components wear out  Better to have two 
servicing missions in space which could well happen than to bring HST down 
and take it up again

I can't speak to sheer mass but part of the problem is that HST
wasn't built to ever be brought back down  It's not built for those
kinds of 'jolt' forces and there is no support cradle for it which is
additional weight that would be required

I vote for a later on scispacemedicine or similar newsgroup fro the
discussion of long term missions into space and there affects on humans and
such Adams

Why bother with a new newsgroup  If you want to discuss the subject
start discussing it  If there is enough traffic to annoy the rest of
us we will let you know and then it will be time for a new newsgroup

Well here goes

The first item of business is to establish the importance space life
sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind  I mean compared
to football and baseball the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested
or even curious about spaceflight  I think that this forum can
make a major change in that lack of insight and education

All of us in our own way can contribute to a comprehensive document
which can be released to the general public around the world  The
document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long
term human habitation in space

I believe that if any longterm space exploration program is to 
succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld
ie the spacecraft  Only through the careful analyses of engineering
chemical biological and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created
to facilitate human life on a longduration flight

So I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective
methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies
which can be applied to longduration spaceflight  Such a detailed
literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates
and clearly important to existing space programs

In essence we would be dividing the space life science issues into
various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies
This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the
basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet isunet
and any other source

It may be a NEW Physics problem ie a problem involving new

models which use old physics  New physics is a big step and is only
tolerated when there is no alternative  For example  the Dark Matter
Problem there's more to the universe than meets the eye is a question
of comparable mystery to GRBs but we have much better data regarding
it  Theoreticians postulate new particles all the time to explain it
but no one will actually believe that these particles are real until an
experimentalist or several detects them in the lab

ANNOUNCEMENT	The HyperKnowledge PROJECT for NeXTSTEP
 
Motivation
 
We are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our  
work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by  
incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages too often  
claiming to do everything  

What we need is an objectoriented scientific environment where the tools  
we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system  
highly interactive and extendable both by the addition of our own  
specialized objects and by combining the available tools  graphically   
The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work  
requiring a very short learning phase and practically no  
userdocumentation  


I know this is kinda off the subject of scispace but not really I want to
answer this for their as well as everyone else's information  What these
people are proposing by and large already exists and can be purchased today

It is called labview by National Instruments  IT is a wonderful object
oriented graphical programming language  IT has been implemented on
both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes  IT is fare superior to any programming
approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software
development time for our shuttle payloads by  percent  This program is
not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis 
capability

Why reinvent the wheel on a platform that may not exist It is a great
idea but look out there at what is available today  The Hydrogen leak on
the Shuttle was found using this software All SSME control and simulation
studies along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW  There
are tons of applications with the ability to create virtual instruments
that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires  With the
addition of IEEE support the computer becomes a virtual control station
allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation With serial
IO support that instrument can be anywhere  The ground control software
for the main control of SEDSAT  will utilize this approach

Well pat for once I agree with you and I like your first idea that you had
IT probably is the gamma ray signature of the warp transitions of interstellar
spacecraft 

Well it makes as much sense as some things I was at the first Gamma Ray
Burst conference here at UAH and had great fun watching the discomfiture
of many of the Gamma Ray scientists Much scruitiny was given to the
data reductions I remember one person in particular who passionately declared
that the data was completely wrong as there were no explanation for the
phenomena of the smooth sky distribution heck it even shoots down the
warp transition theory  The next conference is soon and I will endeavour
to keep in touch with this fun subject

Given that fact and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
of approx  arcmin we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can
determine the location rotational of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge
of the allsky map's accuracy  PR material for the other three instruments
give accuracies on the order of fractions of a degree if that's 
any help

But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here  The other x
three instruments are focusing instruments that more or less form
an image so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
resolving power of the optics  BATSE is an altogether different
beast effectively just  coincidence counters one on each corner of 
the craft  Positional information is triangulated from the 
differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors
Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors
and errors in craft attitude Since none of the  BASTE detectors have
any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be used to
determine parallax  Indeed parallax would just add a very small 
component to the positional error  

Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would 
require resolution on the order of arcseconds since the oort 
cloud is postulated to extend to about  parsec all together 
now Parallax ARc SECond a parsec is the distance of an object 
that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a  AU base line
If the  degree accuracy reported above is true we're going to 
have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline

The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and
watches the entire sky simultaneously a realy handy combination
when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from

I'm not sure if this is a big issue but it seems to me like it
might be  up till now all g forces applied to the mirror and
its mounting and nearly all g forces have been applied along the
telescope's optical axis and against the mirror's base  Reentry
would apply forces along roughly the same axis but tending to pull
the mirror away from the mount and the landing would apply onedge
forces to both the mirror and mount  It could be that one or both

Obviously not  Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long
for this to be possible  The CGRO is what  meters long  You'd
need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this

What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of
the detectors also as a function of photon energy  Each of the
detectors does not have isotropic response  To do this right one must
model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector
and even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back onto
the spacecraft  I believe they have now reduced the error to about 
degrees

And what is the motion sickness
that some astronauts occasionally experience 

It is the body's reaction to a strange environment  It appears to be induced
partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress  Some people are 
more prone to it than others like some people are more prone to get sick 
on a roller coaster ride than others  The mental part is usually induced by 
a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down ie the Shuttle is 
normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth so the Earth 
or ground is above the head of the astronauts  About  of the astronauts 
experience some form of motion sickness and NASA has done numerous tests in

    Power allocation   watts
    Required instruments
	Visible imaging system x CCD  mm fl f optics
	IR mapping spectrometer x HgCdTe array  energy resolution
	UV spectrometer  nm  nm resolution
	Radio science ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system
		ultrastable means 

This doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated
to the  mission of the spacecraft  In addition the power will come
from a radioisotope thermal generator and the whole space craft will
be about  feet in diameter with no booms which means there will be
strong gammalines from Pu and associated schmutz in the
background which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat

It would still be nice and our group here at Goddard is looking
in to it

   But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
 back and you could have problems  The shuttle just isn't designed to land 
 with that much weight in the payload
 
 Is HST really that much heavier than a Spacelab 
 
 I can't speak to sheer mass but part of the problem is that HST
 wasn't built to ever be brought back down  It's not built for those
 kinds of 'jolt' forces and there is no support cradle for it which is
 additional weight that would be required

Just to throw it out there  The mass of the telescope is  kg 
 lb  I do not know what Space lab weighs but I believe it is
less  Can anyone verify

Also remember that weight was not the only concern as many others have 
noted just one possible concern  I was responding to a statement that
if you can boost it why can't you land it  Those are too different
problems

 If you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in

I disagree with what to tout although I agree that the space program is
inherently a good thing  Most people today only care about what will it
cost me and what's in it for me and could care less about whether
something is simply worthwhile in and of itself  Our society has become
increasingly geared toward the shortterm which you could read as NOW 
They couldn't care less about next week much less next century  They want
something to show for the expenditure and they want it now

I think we should tell them about the things that they are using now that
are spinoffs of the space program  That is the only way you can prove
its worth to them  and they vote and pay taxes too  The continued
existence of the space program relies upon that money

In article STEINLYAprtopazucscedu steinlytopazucscedu Steinn Sigurdsson writes

   The problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
   no plausible mechanism has been proposed It would have
   to involve new physics as far as I can tell Closest to
   conventional Oort sources is a model of Bfield pinching
   by comets it's got too many holes in it to count but at
   least it was a good try

So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances
Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
hypothesis which had a lot of problems anyhow  We have to look for
implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
models

A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came
through the astrophysics abstract service  To get a copy of this
paper send a message to astrophbabbagesissait with the subject
line 
  get 


Here is the abstract of that paper

   The currently favored explanation for the origin of GRBs puts them
   at cosmological distances
   but as long as there is no distance
   indicator to these events all possible sources which are
   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration This is
   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list
   although there is no known mechanism for generating GRBs
   from cometary nuclei Unlikely as it may seem the possibility that GRBs
   originate in the solar cometary cloud
   cannot be excluded until it is disproved

   We use the available data on the distribution of GRBs the BATSE
   catalogue up to March  and
   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams  to
   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations
   between the angular distributions of GRBs and comets' aphelia
   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect
   at least to some extent true variations
   in the column density of the Oort cloud We also apply the vov
   test to both distributions

   We have  performed a variety of statistical tests a KolmogorovSmirnov
   test for the distributions in galactic latitude a
   chi test for the spherical multiple moments and a D
   crosscorrelation analysis including testing subsamples for
   isolating the effect of possible observational biases
   These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree but
   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any
   connection with complete confidence We performed MonteCarlo simulations
   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds sim 
   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions
   Currently
    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement
   found for the vov parameter which makes the Oort
   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to GRBs

 Does anyone have a reference something I can look up not just your own
 recollections  I have a few of those myself on the temperature of the
 night sky as seen from space

 Note I am not talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background
 Radiation  There are more things in the sky than just the MBR what I'm
 after is total blackbody temperature  what a thermal radiator would see
 disregarding or shielding against the Sun and nearby large warm objects


I'm not sure if this will help you but the local interstellar
radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups  If I
remember things correctly the models involved contributions from three
different BB sources so there's no obvious temperature of background
radiation in our local area  However the following references give the
interstellar radiation density as a function of wavelength and you can
integrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an effective
temperature if you like

Witt and Johnson  Astrophys J    
Henry et al  Astrophys J    
Mathis et al  Astron Astrophys    

As you can see the references are out of date but they might get you
started

Hope this helps

This does not propose a mechanism for GRBs in the Oort and no
antimatter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
as I understand annihilation spectra Big difference
That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
known  in particular comet aphelia which are not well known
are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution

I'm wondering if vandalize is the proper word to use in this situation  My
dictionary defines vandalism as the willful or malicious destructuion of 
public or private property especially of anything beautiful or artisitc I
would agree the sky is beautiful but not that it is public or private property

I personally prefer natural skies far from city lights and sans aircraft  
However there is also something to be said for being able to look up into the
sky and see a satellite  Many people get a real kick out of it especially if
they haven't seen one before

  Subject RE Level  Shuttle Software Work

  Bret

  If you are familiar with the software work that received the Level 
  rating could you post a description of it andor some references  I
  think many people would be interested to know just what the IBM team
  on that effort is doing differently from most other organizationsprojects
  that earned them that rating

I am familiar with the project  It is the Onboard Shuttle Flight
Software Project  This software controls the Space Shuttle During
all dynamic phases as well as onorbit
It has ultrahigh reliability and extremely
low error rates  There have been several papers published on the
subject and I'll collect some references  There may be an
article in the IBM Systems Journal Late ' early '

There is no magic formula  We did it with dedicated and disciplined
folks who worked to put together a process that finds and removes errors
and is corrected based on errors that escape  We present a
one day overview of our process periodically to interested folks
The next one is May th in Washington DC  I can fax specifics
to those who are interested

 But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here  The other x
 three instruments are focusing instruments that more or less form
 an image so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
 resolving power of the optics  BATSE is an altogether different
 beast effectively just  coincidence counters one on each corner of 
 the craft  Positional information is triangulated from the 
 differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors

This is not quite right  The differential arrival time techinique
requires interplanetary baselines to get good positions  The
differential arrival at the eight detectors differ by 's of nanoseconds
This is smaller than BATSE's microsecond timing capabilities
BATSE Ulysses and Mars Obsverver are used for this technique

Each BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view
The sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing 
angle of incidence  The burst position on the sky is determined by
comparing the count rates in different detectors

I know its semantics but the noop doesn't do anything  The

noop is simply a spacecraft command that drops bits into the big

If reboosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it
then why couldn't HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done
here
 
Is it because two shuttle flights would be required adding to the alredy
horrendous expense
 

I don't think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landinglaunch
in terms of stressesmisalignmentsetc  I would think of the reboost as
a gentile push where a landing then launch as two JOLTS which would
put more mechanical stress on the instruments  Additionally there might
be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden
landing  Finally probably some thought went into possible contamination 
problems if the instruments came back to earth

Of course the cost of two shuttle launches is a good reason to avoid
something that might be done in one shuttle launch  Here's hoping
Cepi's gang gets the job done right the first time

  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the

with that much weight in the payload

Is HST really that much heavier than a Spacelab 

HST is about  lbs  kg  That doesn't include the cradle that
would have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed  SpacelabJ on STS
was  lbs according to the presskit 

As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some
reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this
was a planned for contingency  This is not a problem for the shuttle
though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site they still have to go to
Edwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay

   scispace readers can skip the first paragraph

  Yesterday in response to Henry Spencer's question about the 
temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space I said Dust grains
acts as blackbodies and they're at  K  Well I was dead
wrong  Our local interstellar dust expert Bruce Draine has
informed me that dust grains aren't good radiators in the far IR
which is why they are so warm actually the ambient radiation field
from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only  or  Kelvin
Sorry Henry and anyone else I misled  Obviously time for me to
take another ISM class 

  In other news Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave
a talk on the PlutoCharon binary system yesterday  He gave a brief
overview of the currentlyaccepted system parameters volume ratio of
about  mass ratio about  or so plus lots more and then
gave his thoughts on the formation of PlutoCharon  His idea is 
that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer
solar system with masses distributed as a power law of some kind
over time the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies  Most got
scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter
and Saturn but many accreted into the gas giants especially
Uranus and Neptune  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune 
we call it Triton captured how  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller
alreadyexisting Neptunian moon perhaps by a very close passage through
Neptune's atmosphere  mondo aerobraking

  He notes that the two recently discovered Kuiper Belt objects
 QB and  FW plus Chiron and Pholus are all about the same 
mass and he identifies this group as oneaccretiondown from the
larger bodies of Triton and PlutoCharon  PlutoCharon he thinks
formed when an impacting body hit protoPluto knocking some material
into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon similar to
ideas about the formation of Earth's moon  There is good evidence
from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different
Pluto has methane frost Charon doesn't which can be used as evidence
for the impact theory

  He believes that there may be around  PlutotoChironsized objects
remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's 
orbit beyond  AU or so   QB and  FW are the first members
of this population to be found in his model  Note that such bodies
will be very dark since if their surfaces are covered with methane 
frost it will have photolyzed into very dark longchain hydrocarbons
by now  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo around  I think
is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate
and when the atmosphere freezes out again thirty years later it forms
bright new frost  So any bodies much farther away than  AU are going
to be very hard to see

  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription if you see
a howling mistake it's undoubtedly mine not his

  By the way he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby
mission I think and said that the current plans are to use a
Titan  to send the probe on just about a rectilinear trajectory
to Pluto we were speaking loosely at the time  He'd like
to use a Proton which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs
MUCH less  His figures  Million for  Titan  launches there
will be two separate probes launched separately or  Million
for  Proton launches  He told a story about how the Soviets originally
offered to sell Proton launches for  Million each but were forced
to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the
marketplace

  I'm just telling you what he said

                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                               POSTLAUNCH
                           April    

SPACECRAFT

  On April  and  delta Differenced Oneway Range DOR passes were
performed over DSS GoldstoneMadrid  meter antennas and DSS
GoldstoneCanberra  meter antennas respectively  Initial results 
indicate the delta DOR pass on April  was unsuccessful due to ground
station hardware problems but the one on April  was successfully performed

  On April  a cruise science Memory Readout MRO was performed for the
Magnetometer MAG instrument  Analysis indicates the data was received
properly

  On April  the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the
spacecraft stored sequence  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS
Command Data Subsystem prior to launch and were again commanded closed to
preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relayswiring being a
source of internal electrostatic charge IESD

  On April  cruise science Memory Readouts MRO were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV Dust Detector DDS and Magnetometer
MAG instruments  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly

  During the period from April  to April  a navigation cycle was
performed  This navigation cycle provided nearcontinuous acquisition of
twoway doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the
spacecraft over DSS DSS and DSS

  On April  realtime commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay
Antenna RRA in preparation for the minisequence slew test on April 
The RRA was slewed from approximately  degrees from stow to approximately
 degrees  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 
degrees which was well within the predicted range  The RRA was commanded back
to approximately  degrees from stow  Preliminary analysis indicated the
antenna reached about  degrees also well within the predicted range  The
RRA motor temperature was at  degree C at the start of the activity and had
increased to  degrees C at its completion

     After verifying proper RRA slewing the RRA slew test minisequence was
uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April   Upon successful uplink
a Delayed Action Command DAC was sent which will reposition the stator on
May  to its initial pretest position  Also a DAC was sent to turn the
TwoWay Noncoherent TWNC on April  prior to the start of the RRA slew test
minisequence

  On April  a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
 hours its planned value during this mission phase

  On April  the RRA slew test executed nominally  The spacecraft under
stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about  degrees
from stow and going to  degrees back to  degrees then to  degrees
back to  degrees then to  degrees and then back to  degrees  All of
the slews were well within the predicted range  The RRA motor temperature was
at  degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 
degrees C at its completion  After completion of the RRA slews realtime
commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pretest configuration

  The ACDC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change
greater than  DN throughout this period  The AC measurement reads  DN
 volts  The DC measurement reads  DN  volts  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ACDC special
anomaly team

 The Spacecraft status as of April   is as follows

       a  System Power Margin    watts
       b  Spin Configuration  DualSpin
       c  Spin RateSensor  rpmStar Scanner
       d  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately  degrees

       e  Downlink telemetry rateantenna bpscodedLGA
       f  General Thermal Control  all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g  RPM Tank Pressures  all within acceptable range
       h  Orbiter Science Instruments powered on are the PWS
           EUV UVS EPD MAG HIC and DDS
       i  ProbeRRH  powered off temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j  CMD Loss Timer Setting   hours
           Time To Initiation   hours


GDS Ground Data Systems

  The first GalileoGDS test of the MGDS V Command System CMD took
place April   with DSS Madrid  meter antenna  The test went
well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN
Deep Space Network Group  Command Processor Assembly CPA  The test was
successful and the next test for V CMD is scheduled for May   with
DSS Goldstone  meter antenna

  The April System Engineers Monthly ReportSEMRGround System Development
Office GSDO MMR was conducted Thursday April    A review of current
Project and Institutional DSN and MOSO system status was conducted  Ongoing
cruise development plus the GSDO Phase  and  delivery schedules past months
accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed  No significant
schedule changes or significant problems were reported


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday April   the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows

	Distance from Earth          km  AU
	Distance from Sun            km  AU
	Heliocentric Speed           km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter        km
	Round Trip Light Time        minutes  seconds

SPECIAL TOPIC

  As of April   a total of  realtime commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch  Of these   were initiated in the
sequence design process and  initiated in the realtime command process
In the past week  real time commands were transmitted  were initiated
in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command
process  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial
RRA slew test uplink the RRA slew test minisequence DACs to reposition the
stator and turn the TWNC on reset the command loss timer and execute the
RRA slew test

 ANNOUNCEMENT	The HyperKnowledge PROJECT for NeXTSTEP
 
 I know this is kinda off the subject of scispace but not really I want to
 answer this for their as well as everyone else's information  What these
 people are proposing by and large already exists and can be purchased today
 
 It is called labview by National Instruments IT is a wonderful object
 IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language
 some lines deleted

I am afraid you are misdirected NeXTSTEP is an operating system as opposed to 
a package I have read a little about it but since Steve Jobs does not seem to 
have the marketing capabilities of Bill Gates my info is limited Probably why
the far inferior Windows NT is going to be more widely distributed but that
is another flameridden story Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are
binary compatibility across platforms eg you can just copy your program from
a Sparc to a PC and it would run as opposed to buying the version of the package
ported to a PC graphical objectoriented design its all WSIWIG postscript 
supports parallel hetrogeneous processing and best of all it is based around 
the Mach microkernel so you can make it look like Unix with X or DOS or NT or 
even VMS if you feel the need No package out there comes even close I hope 
people will subscribe to the HyperKnowledge project and NeXTSTEP finally
takes off in my lifetime

	   Alsoif they did come from the Oort cloud we would expect to
   see the same from other stars Oort Clouds

That's a very good point  Perhaps none of the nearby stars have Oort
clouds  Alphacentauri is a multiplestar system you wouldn't expect
an Oort cloud in it

Sure about that Maybe Proxima might cause problems but at Oort
Cloud distances AC a and AC b together look like a point source

Besides even the solar system's Oort cloud is unstable over
geologic time right and needs to be replentished from somewhere
else like the short period comets of the Kupier Belt

Or maybe I'm misremembering something I read or heard somewhere

  What's the nearest singlestar that is likely to
have a planetary system

Until we're able to perform a broadband survey of nearby stars
to detect planets we won't know enough to say whether or not
a single star has planets And we're likely to find out about the
close ones first

Heck if neutron stars can have planets anything can have planets
Or was that discovery disconfirmed

Are you talking about a single BATSE component or
the whole thing

You could propose a BATSE probe launch two or three with ion

the more they're spaced apart You could probably cheaply eject them
from the solar system with enough flybys and patience

Things would start out slow then slowly get better and better

Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and
relaunching it

Caution speculation mode engaged
There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet
I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay  Most of the deployed
items antennas and especially the solar arays probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position even by hand  They would
have to be removed by the astronauts  The only advantage that this
might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due
to thermal cycle stresses

I also expect that as has been discussed the landing loads on the
HST optics structure is a big issue but that the reentry loads are
much less so  Can the moveable optical components even be recaged
I assume that they were caged for launch

The first item of business is to establish the importance space life
sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind  I mean compared
to football and baseball the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested
or even curious about spaceflight 

I disagree  It think the average joe is interestedcurious about spaceflight
but sees it as an elitist activity  Not one which he is ever going to
participate in

All of us in our own way can contribute to a comprehensive document
which can be released to the general public around the world  The
document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long
term human habitation in space

Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details
of long term space habitation  I like the idea of the study but it should
be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it
If you want a general public document you'll need a more general publication

I believe that if any longterm space exploration program is to 
succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld
ie the spacecraft  Only through the careful analyses of engineering
chemical biological and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created
to facilitate human life on a longduration flight

As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems engineering
the microworld isn't the problem  The problem is understanding the basic
chemical biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them
efficiently  For example the only way we know how to produce food is from
plants and animals  Food synthesis is not very far advanced  So we have
to orbit a farm  Well that's obviously not very efficient so we use 
technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of 
using dirt  This is where the engineering comes in  But new technologies
bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to  Like in 
dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other but in 
hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that  The lettuce growth is 
stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes  So 
now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar
interactions  This means some basic applied scientific research  And that's
what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far
We also need to find out how they interact together  That's where we are now

So I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective
methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies
which can be applied to longduration spaceflight 

First you need to do the literature search  There is a lot of information
out there  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation
This could be useful especially if we make it available on the net  Then
we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies

Such a detailed
literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates
and clearly important to existing space programs
In essence we would be dividing the space life science issues into
various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies
This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the
basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet isunet
and any other source

Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net
I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search 
first  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis  The data
base itself could be useful for future engineers

That's my response Ken what do you think

                Obtain a good sample of plant seeds all of the same 
                   kind  Some kinds might work better that others

                Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight

                Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper 
                   for three or four weeks

                Separately incinerate both groups

                Weigh the residue from each group  The residue of 
                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least 
                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group

                Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for 
                   mineral content  Some of the mineral atoms of the 
                   sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier

          oxygen hydrogen etc 
          
               The two reactions Si  C  Ca by microorganisms

There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask

  If we encounter a life form during our space exploration how do we
determine if we should capture it imprison it and then discect it

  If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly will
we expend resources from earth to help them

  With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable
what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought
back or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere

I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans
I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
of physical aspects of the planet  The question is what physical aspects
simply disallow earth like conditions

eg Temperature range of K to K where temp is purely dependant on dist
     from the sun and the suns temperature
   Atmospheric presure   I know nothing of human tolerance
   Planetary Mass   again gravity at surface is important how much
     can human bodies take day after day  Also how does the mass effect
     atmosphere  I thinking of planets between  and  times mass of the
     earth  I suppose density should be important as well

Climate etc does not concern me nor does axial tilt etc etc  Just the above
three factors and how they relate to one another

Jonathan

Jonathan interesting questions  Some wonder whether or not the moon could
have ever supported an atmosphere  I'd be interested in knowing what
our geologyenvironmental sciences friends think

As for human tolerances the best example of human endurance in terms
of altitude ie low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure
is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt Everest without oxygen assistance
This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high
altitudes for quite awhile I think a few months and then were flown by
helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on
Mount Everest where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak
without oxygen tanks  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance because
if you or I tried to go to  feet and exert ourselves we would probably
pass out get altitude sick and could even die from cerebral edema So
this is the limit of low pressure  High pressure situations would be
limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher
pressure  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and
could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the
bends  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of
pressure not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in
front of me  Usually at a certain point the nitrogen in the air becomes
toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic  Divers call this nitrogen
narcosis  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things like
taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at  feet
under water  Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter as I
am not a diving expert

Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere
is too thin  th  our Earth's atmospheric density  In addition
the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide  Basically you would need a 
pressure suit there or you'd die from the low pressure  Interesting huh

Did anybody see this program

It would be nice if someone here from the HST program was talking instead
of all the speculation that is going on here From what I understand from
Dr Frank Six of the Marshall Space Flight Center there is no insrmountable
problem in bringing HST back IT was designed that way to begin with

Also it is my understanding that the solar arrays WILL be one of the items
replaced on this mission The originals were built by Brit Aerospace and
I think the new ones are too I am currently working with the guys at MSFC
that are in charge is the HST power system although I have not spoken with
them in a long time about HST

INTRODUCTION

     From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for
untold thousands of years Ancient astronomers observed points of
light that appeared to move among the stars They called these
objects planets meaning wanderers and named them after Roman
deities  Jupiter king of the gods Mars the god of war
Mercury messenger of the gods Venus the god of love and
beauty and Saturn father of Jupiter and god of agriculture The
stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails and meteors
or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky

     Science flourished during the European Renaissance
Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were
discovered and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were
calculated In the th century astronomers pointed a new device
called the telescope at the heavens and made startling
discoveries

     But the years since  have amounted to a golden age of
solar system exploration Advancements in rocketry after World
War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity
and travel to the Moon and to other planets

     The United States has sent automated spacecraft then
humancrewed expeditions to explore the Moon Our automated
machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars explored the
Sun's environment observed comets and made closerange surveys
while flying past Mercury Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune

     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and
understanding of the solar system Through the electronic sight
and other senses of our automated spacecraft color and
complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared
to Earthbound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light
And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered

     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights
through the solar system as some of the most remarkable
achievements of the th century
     

AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT

     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's NASA's
automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many
shapes and sizes While they are designed to fulfill separate and
specific mission objectives the craft share much in common

     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments
selected for a particular mission supported by basic subsystems
for electrical power trajectory and orientation control as well
as for processing data and communicating with Earth

     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft
instruments and systems NASA uses both solar energy from arrays
of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its
solar system missions Rechargeable batteries are employed for
backup and supplemental power

     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed
millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a
planet only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments
pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target To help
prevent such a mishap a subsystem of small thrusters is used to
control spacecraft

     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a
constant gaze at selected stars Just as Earth's early seafarers
used the stars to navigate the oceans spacecraft use stars to
maintain their bearings in space With the subsystem locked onto
fixed points of reference flight controllers can keep a
spacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body
and the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth The
thrusters can also be used to finetune the flight path and speed
of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at
the planned distance and on the proper trajectory

     Between  and  NASA spacecraft were dispatched to
study the Moon and the solar environment they also scanned the
inner planets other than Earth  Mercury Venus and Mars These
three worlds and our own are known as the terrestrial planets
because they share a solidrock composition

     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions NASA
employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the
Mariners Their flights helped shape the planning of later
missions Between  and  seven Mariner missions conducted
the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space

     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power
source The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had
two wings covered with photovoltaic cells Other Mariners were
equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal
bodies

     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner  Venus
spacecraft weighing in at  kilograms  pounds to the
Mariner  Mars Orbiter weighing in at  kilograms 
pounds their basic design remained quite similar throughout the
program The Mariner  Venus spacecraft for example had
originally been a backup for the Mariner  Mars flyby The
Mariner  spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components
left over from the Mariner  Mars Orbiter program

     In  NASA launched Pioneer  a Jupiter spacecraft
Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets  Jupiter
Saturn Uranus and Neptune  giant balls of dense gas quite
different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed

     Four NASA spacecraft in all  two Pioneers and two Voyagers
 were sent in the s to tour the outer regions of our solar
system Because of the distances involved these travelers took
anywhere from  months to  years to reach their destinations
Barring faster spacecraft they will eventually become the first
human artifacts to journey to distant stars Because the Sun's
light becomes so faint in the outer solar system these travelers
do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity
generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes

     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit
our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late s Twin
Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather
stations and as biology laboratories Two advanced orbiters 
descendants of the Mariner craft  carried the Viking Landers
from Earth and then studied martian features from above

     Two drumshaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 
The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument
that allowed it to see through the planet's dense cloud cover
to study surface features The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried
four probes that were dropped through the clouds The probes and
the main body  all of which contained scientific instruments 
radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their
descent toward the surface

     A new generation of automated spacecraft  including
Magellan Galileo Ulysses Mars Observer the Comet
RendezvousAsteroid Flyby CRAF and Cassini  is being
developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed
examinations that will increase our understanding of our
neighborhood and our own planet
     

The Sun

     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start
with the Sun The Sun dwarfs the other bodies representing
approximately  percent of all the mass in the solar system
all of the planets moons asteroids comets dust and gas add up
to only about  percent This  percent represents the
material left over from the Sun's formation One hundred and nine
Earths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk and its
interior could hold over  million Earths

     As a star the Sun generates energy through the process of
fusion The temperature at the Sun's core is  million degrees
Celsius  million degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure there
is  billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level The Sun's
surface temperature of  degrees Celsius  degrees
Fahrenheit seems almost chilly compared to its coretemperature
At the solar core hydrogen can fuse into helium producing
energy The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams
of charged particles both extending far beyond the planets

     The Sun appears to have been active for  billion years
and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or
so At the end of its life the Sun will start to fuse helium
into heavier elements and begin to swell up ultimately growing
so large that it will swallow Earth After a billion years as a
red giant it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf 
the final end product of a star like ours It may take a trillion
years to cool off completely

     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment but
none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately
twothirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun Pioneers 
the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Voyagers  and  and other spacecraft
have all sampled the solar environment The Ulysses spacecraft
launched on October   is a joint solar mission of NASA and
the European Space Agency After using Jupiter's gravity to
change its trajectory Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar
regions during  and  and will perform a wide range of
studies using nine onboard scientific instruments

     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is If
it were different in almost any way life would almost certainly
never have developed on Earth
     

Mercury

     Obtaining the first closeup views of Mercury was the
primary objective of the Mariner  spacecraft launched on
November   from Kennedy Space Center in Florida After a
journey of nearly five months which included a flyby of Venus
the spacecraft passed within  kilometers  miles of the
solar system's innermost planet on March  

     Until Mariner  little was known about Mercury Even the
best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct
object lacking any surface detail The planet is so close to the
Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare When the planet is
visible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn it
is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere Only radar
telescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to
the voyage of Mariner 

     The photographs Mariner  radioed back to Earth revealed an
ancient heavily cratered surface closely resembling our own
Moon The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the
planet These apparently were created when Mercury's interior
cooled and shrank buckling the planet's crust The cliffs are as
high as  kilometers  miles and as long as  kilometers 
miles

     Instruments on Mariner  discovered that Mercury has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere  a trillionth the
density of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon neon
and helium When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun
surface temperatures range from  degrees Celsius  degrees
Fahrenheit on Mercury's sunlit side to  degrees Celsius
 degrees Fahrenheit on the dark side This range in surface
temperature   degrees Celsius  degrees Fahrenheit 
is the largest for a single body in the solar system Mercury
literally bakes and freezes at the same time

     Days and nights are long on Mercury The combination of a
slow rotation relative to the stars  Earth days and a rapid
revolution around the Sun  Earth days means that one Mercury
solar day takes  Earth days or two Mercury years  the time
it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the
Sun 

     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like
that of Earth Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy ironrich
core making up slightly less than half of its volume That would
make Mercury's core larger proportionally than the Moon's core
or those of any of the planets

     After the initial Mercury encounter Mariner  made two
additional flybys  on September   and March   
before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted
and the mission was concluded Each flyby took place at the same
local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was
illuminated as a result we still have not seen onehalf of the
planet's surface
     

Venus

     Veiled by dense cloud cover Venus  our nearest planetary
neighbor  was the first planet to be explored The Mariner 
spacecraft launched on August   was the first of more
than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the
mysterious planet As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus
plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface
romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to
rest

     On December   Mariner  passed within 
kilometers  miles of Venus and became the first
spacecraft to scan another planet onboard instruments measured
Venus for  minutes Mariner  launched in June  flew much
closer to the planet Passing within  kilometers 
miles of Venus on the second American flyby Mariner 's
instruments measured the planet's magnetic field ionosphere
radiation belts and temperatures On its way to Mercury Mariner
 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth
showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere

     In the spring and summer of  two spacecraft were
launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus On December 
of the same year the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first
spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet

     Five days later the five separate components making up the
second spacecraft  the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe  entered the
Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet The
four small independent probes and the main body radioed
atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the
surface Although designed to examine the atmosphere one of the
probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to
transmit data for another hour

     Venus resembles Earth in size physical composition and
density more closely than any other known planet However
spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well For
example Venus' rotation west to east is retrograde backward
compared to the easttowest spin of Earth and most of the other
planets

     Approximately  percent of Venus' atmosphere  times as
dense as Earth's is carbon dioxide The principal constituent of
Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen Venus' atmosphere acts like a
greenhouse permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but
trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into
space As a result the planet's average surface temperature is
 degrees Celsius  degrees Fahrenheit hot enough to melt
lead

     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the
first means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and
determining surface features over almost the entire planet
NASA's Magellan spacecraft launched on May   has been in
orbit around Venus since August   The spacecraft uses
radarmapping techniques to provide ultrahighresolution images
of the surface

     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic
features faults and impact craters Huge areas of the surface
show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows
lying on top of previous ones An elevated region named Ishtar
Terra is a lavafilled basin as large as the United States At
one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes a mountain the size
of Mount Everest Scarring the mountain's flank is a
kilometer mile wide kilometer mile deep
impact crater named Cleopatra Almost all features on Venus are
named for women Maxwell Montes Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are
the exceptions Craters survive on Venus for perhaps  million
years because there is no water and very little wind erosion

     Extensive faultline networks cover the planet probably the
result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics
on Earth But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to
weaken the rock which cracks just about everywhere preventing
the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like
the San Andreas Fault in California

     Venus' predominant weather pattern is a highaltitude
highspeed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid At
speeds reaching as high as  kilometers  miles per hour
the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days The
circulation is in the same direction  west to east  as Venus'
slow rotation of  Earth days whereas Earth's winds blow in
both directions  west to east and east to west  in six
alternating bands Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified
laboratory for the study of our weather
     

Earth

     As viewed from space our world's distinguishing
characteristics are its blue waters brown and green land masses
and white clouds We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting
of  percent nitrogen  percent oxygen and  percent other
constituents The only planet in the solar system known to harbor
life Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of  million
kilometers  million miles Earth is the third planet from the
Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system with a diameter
just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus

     Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickeliron core give
rise to an extensive magnetic field which along with the
atmosphere shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation
coming from the Sun and other stars Earth's atmosphere protects
us from meteors as well most of which burn up before they can
strike the surface Active geological processes have left no
evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon
after it formed  about  billion years ago Along with the
other newly formed planets it was showered by space debris in
the early days of the solar system

     From our journeys into space we have learned much about our
home planet The first American satellite  Explorer   was
launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January   and
discovered an intense radiation zone now called the Van Allen
radiation belts surrounding Earth

     Since then other research satellites have revealed that our
planet's magnetic field is distorted into a teardrop shape by
the solar wind  the stream of charged particles continuously
ejected from the Sun We've learned that the magnetic field does
not fade off into space but has definite boundaries And we now
know that our wispy upper atmosphere once believed calm and
uneventful seethes with activity  swelling by day and
contracting by night Affected by changes in solar activity the
upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth

     Besides affecting Earth's weather solar activity gives rise
to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere When charged
particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic
field they collide with air molecules above our planet's
magnetic poles These air molecules then begin to glow and are
known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights

     Satellites about  kilometers  miles out in
space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting These
watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms Continuous
global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and
contributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather
systems

     From their unique vantage points satellites can survey
Earth's oceans land use and resources and monitor the planet's
health These eyes in space have saved countless lives provided
tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our
planet in dangerous ways
     

The Moon

     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite The first
human footsteps on an alien world were made by American
astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless lifeless
companion In preparation for the humancrewed Apollo
expeditions NASA dispatched the automated Ranger Surveyor and
Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between  and 

     NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials
and data Six twoastronaut crews landed on and explored the
lunar surface between  and  carrying back a collection
of rocks and soil weighing a total of  kilograms  pounds
and consisting of more than  separate samples

     From this material and other studies scientists have
constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy
Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 
billion years old The first few million years of the Moon's
existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain
As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into
different kinds of rock the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids
and smaller objects Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode
Island or Delaware and their collisions with the Moon created
basins hundreds of kilometers across

     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four
billion years ago leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge
overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken
rock Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to
melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about  kilometers
 miles below the surface Then for the next  million
years  from about  to  billion years ago  lava rose
from inside the Moon The lava gradually spread out over the
surface flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas
that Galileo Galilei an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance
called maria meaning seas

     As far as we can tell there has been no significant
volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years
Since then the lunar surface has been altered only by
micrometeorites by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars
by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and
astronauts If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion
years ago they would have seen a landscape very similar to the
one today Thousands of years from now the footsteps left by the
Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear

     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery Four theories
attempt an explanation the Moon formed near Earth as a separate
body it was torn from Earth it formed somewhere else and was
captured by our planet's gravity or it was the result of a
collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars
The last theory has some good support but is far from certain
     

Mars

     Of all the planets Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life
Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what
appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface These
observations  later determined to be optical illusions  led
to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a
system of irrigation canals on the planet In  when Orson
Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction
classic War of the Worlds  by HG Wells enough people believed
in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic

     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to
do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's
surface This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might
support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months
and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods

     So far six American missions to Mars have been carried out
Four Mariner spacecraft  three flying by the planet and one
placed into martian orbit  surveyed the planet extensively
before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived

     Mariner  launched in late  flew past Mars on July 
 coming within  kilometers  miles of the
surface Transmitting to Earth  closeup pictures of the
planet the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring
channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water
Mariners  and  followed with their flybys during the summer of
 and returned  pictures Mariners   and  showed a
diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin cold dry
atmosphere of carbon dioxide

     On May   the Mariner  Orbiter was launched on a
mission to make a yearlong study of the martian surface The
spacecraft arrived five and a half months after liftoff only to
find Mars in the midst of a planetwide dust storm that made
surface photography impossible for several weeks But after the
storm cleared Mariner  began returning the first of 
pictures these revealed previously unknown martian features
including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across
the surface etching river valleys and flood plains

     In August and September  the Viking  and  spacecraft
 each consisting of an orbiter and a lander  lifted off from
Kennedy Space Center The mission was designed to answer several
questions about the red planet including Is there life there
Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities but it was
hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at
least find evidence of primitive life  past or present

     Viking Lander  became the first spacecraft to successfully
touch down on another planet when it landed on July  
while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial Photos
sent back from the Chryse Planitia Plains of Gold showed a
bleak rustyred landscape Panoramic images returned by the
lander revealed a rolling plain littered with rocks and marked
by rippled sand dunes Fine red dust from the martian soil gives
the sky a salmon hue When Viking Lander  touched down on Utopia
Planitia on September   it viewed a more rolling landscape
than the one seen by its predecessor  one without visible
dunes

     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking
Lander were inconclusive Small samples of the red martian soil
were tested in three different experiments designed to detect
biological processes While some of the test results seemed to
indicate biological activity later analysis confirmed that this
activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil
chemistry Is there life on Mars No one knows for sure but the
Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist
there

     The Viking Landers became weather stations recording wind
velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and
pressure Few weather changes were observed The highest
temperature recorded by either craft was  degrees Celsius 
degrees Fahrenheit at the Viking Lander  site in midsummer

     The lowest temperature  degrees Celsius  degrees
Fahrenheit was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 
site during winter Nearhurricane wind speeds were measured at
the two martian weather stations during global dust storms but
because the atmosphere is so thin wind force is minimal Viking
Lander  photographed light patches of frost  probably
waterice  during its second winter on the planet

     The martian atmosphere like that of Venus is primarily
carbon dioxide Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small
percentages Martian air contains only about  as much
water as our air but even this small amount can condense out
forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around
the slopes of towering volcanoes Local patches of early morning
fog can form in valleys

     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian
atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet Physical
features closely resembling shorelines gorges riverbeds and
islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet

     Mars has two moons Phobos and Deimos They are small and
irregularly shaped and possess ancient cratered surfaces It is
possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too
close to Mars and were captured by its gravity

     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins
their design lifetimes of  and  days respectively The
first to fail was Viking Orbiter  which stopped operating on
July   when a leak depleted its attitudecontrol gas
Viking Lander  operated until April   when it was shut
down because of battery degeneration Viking Orbiter  quit on
August   when the last of its attitudecontrol gas was
used up Viking Lander  ceased functioning on November  

     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology
experiments we know more about Mars than any other planet except
Earth NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft to be launched in
September  will expand our knowledge of the martian
environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet 
     

Asteroids

     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic
objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be
considered fullfledged planets These objects are known as
asteroids or minor planets Most but not all are found in a
band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter Some have
orbits that cross Earth's path and there is evidence that Earth
has been hit by asteroids in the past One of the least eroded
best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near
Winslow Arizona

     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the
solar system One theory suggests that they are the remains of a
planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago More
likely asteroids are material that never coalesced into a
planet In fact if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was
gathered into a single object the object would be only about
 kilometers  miles across  less than half the
diameter of our Moon 

     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth It
is estimated that  are bright enough to eventually be
photographed through Earthbased telescopes

     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from
examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of
Earth Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are
called meteoroids When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at
high velocity friction causes this chunk of space matter to
incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor If the
meteoroid does not burn up completely what's left strikes
Earth's surface and is called a meteorite One of the best places
to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica

     Of all the meteorites examined  percent are composed of
silicate stone and  percent are composed of iron and
nickel the rest are a mixture of the three materials Stony
meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much
like terrestrial rocks

     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar
system scientists are interested in their composition
Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found
that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are
separated by very large distances

     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids
for closer examination The Galileo Orbiter launched by NASA in
October  will investigate mainbelt asteroids on its way to
Jupiter The Comet RendezvousAsteroid Flyby CRAF and Cassini
missions will also study these farflung objects Scheduled for
launch in the latter part of the s the CRAF and Cassini
missions are a collaborative project of NASA the European Space
Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy as
well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy
One day space factories will mine the asteroids for raw
materials
     

Jupiter

     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt in the outer regions of
our solar system lie the giant planets of Jupiter Saturn
Uranus and Neptune In  NASA dispatched the first of four
spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these
colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock Jupiter
was the first port of call

     Pioneer  which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in
March  was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid
belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system In
December  it returned the first closeup images of Jupiter
flying within  kilometers  miles of the planet's
banded cloud tops Pioneer  followed a year later Voyagers 
and  were launched in the summer of  and returned
spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites
during flybys in 

     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of
liquid hydrogen and helium topped with a colorful atmosphere
composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium Ammonia ice
crystals form white Jovian clouds Sulfur compounds and perhaps
phosphorus may produce the brown and orange hues that
characterize Jupiter's atmosphere

     It is likely that methane ammonia water and other gases
react to form organic molecules in the regions between the
planet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying
below Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics however these
organic compounds  if they exist  are probably shortlived

     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through
telescopes on Earth This hurricanelike storm in Jupiter's
atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet As a
highpressure region the Great Red Spot spins in a direction
opposite to that of lowpressure storms on Jupiter it is
surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and
are sometimes consumed by it The Great Red Spot might be a
million years old

     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's
northern lights at the Jovian polar regions Voyager  returned
the first images of a faint narrow ring encircling Jupiter

     Largest of the solar system's planets Jupiter rotates at a
dizzying pace  once every  hours  minutes  seconds The
massive planet takes almost  Earth years to complete a journey
around the Sun With  known moons Jupiter is something of a
miniature solar system

     A new mission to Jupiter  the Galileo Project  is under
way After a six year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once
past Venus twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two
asteroids the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into
Jupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth The Galileo
Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close
to Jupiter's large moons exploring in detail what the two
Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed
     

Galilean Satellites

     In  Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and
spotted four points of light orbiting the planet For the first
time humans had seen the moons of another world In honor of
their discoverer these four bodies would become known as the
Galilean satellites or moons But Galileo might have happily
traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs
returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these
planetsized satellites

     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission
was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io
Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world
other than Earth The Voyager cameras identified at least nine
active volcanoes on Io with plumes of ejected material extending
as far as  kilometers  miles above the moon's surface

     Io's pizzacolored terrain marked by orange and yellow
hues is probably the result of sulfurrich materials brought to
the surface by volcanic activity Volcanic activity on this
satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the
gravitational tugofwar between Io Jupiter and the other three
Galilean moons

     Europa approximately the same size as our Moon is the
brightest Galilean satellite The moon's surface displays a
complex array of streaks indicating the crust has been
fractured Caught in a gravitational tugofwar like Io Europa
has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt 
apparently producing a liquidwater ocean This ocean is covered
by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the
cold of space Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its
center

     Like Europa the other two Galilean moons  Ganymede and
Callisto  are worlds of ice and rock Ganymede is the largest
satellite in the solar system  larger than the planets Mercury
and Pluto The satellite is composed of about  percent water or
ice and the rest rock Ganymede's surface has areas of different
brightness indicating that in the past material oozed out of
the moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the
surface

     Callisto only slightly smaller than Ganymede has the
lowest density of any Galilean satellite suggesting that large
amounts of water are part of its composition Callisto is the
most heavily cratered object in the solar system no activity
during its history has erased old craters except more impacts

     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be
performed by the Galileo Orbiter
     

Saturn

     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn Its
exquisite ring system is unrivaled Like Jupiter Saturn is
composed mostly of hydrogen But in contrast to the vivid colors
and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds Saturn's atmosphere
has a more subtle butterscotch hue and its markings are muted
by highaltitude haze Given Saturn's somewhat placidlooking
appearance scientists were surprised at the highvelocity
equatorial jet stream that blows some  kilometers 
miles per hour

     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn Pioneer 
sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 
returning the first closeup images Voyager  followed in
November  sending back breathtaking photographs that
revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring
system and moons Voyager  flew by the planet and its moons in
August 

     The rings are composed of countless lowdensity particles
orbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive
distances from the cloud tops Analysis of spacecraft radio waves
passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely
in size ranging from dust to housesized boulders The rings are
bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock

     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body
ventured too close to Saturn The unlucky object would have been
torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its
interior Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin
with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity A
third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions
with larger objects orbiting the planet

     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each
other individual ring particles appear to be held in place by
the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites These
complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets
that make up the major rings

     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM
car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager
spacecraft These emissions are typical of lightning but are
believed to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its
atmosphere where no lightning was observed As they had at
Jupiter the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near
Saturn's poles

     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several
satellites that share the same orbit We learned that some moons
shepherd ring particles maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps
in the rings Saturn's th moon was discovered in  from
images taken by Voyager  in  

     Voyager  determined that Titan has a nitrogenbased
atmosphere with methane and argon  one more like Earth's in
composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and
Venus Titan's surface temperature of  degrees Celsius 
degrees Fahrenheit implies that there might be waterice islands
rising above oceans of ethanemethane liquid or sludge
Unfortunately Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's
dense clouds

     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be
converting Titan's methane to ethane acetylene and  in
combination with nitrogen  hydrogen cyanide The latter
compound is a building block of amino acids These conditions may
be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth
between three and four billion years ago However Titan's
atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit
progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry

     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini
mission The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will
also deploy a probe called Huygens which will be dropped into
Titan's atmosphere and fall to the surface Cassini will use the
probe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will
spend years examining the Saturnian system
     

Uranus

     In January  four and a half years after visiting
Saturn Voyager  completed the first closeup survey of the
Uranian system The brief flyby revealed more information about
Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from
ground observations since the planet's discovery over two
centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel

     Uranus third largest of the planets is an oddball of the
solar system Unlike the other planets with the exception of
Pluto this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and
south poles alternately facing the sun during an year swing
around the solar system During Voyager 's flyby the south pole
faced the Sun Uranus might have been knocked over when an
Earthsized object collided with it early in the life of the
solar system

     Voyager  found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow
the usual northsouth axis found on the other planets Instead
the field is tilted  degrees and offset from the planet's
center a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one
magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of
Djakarta on the island of Java in Indonesia

     Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen with some 
percent helium and small amounts of ammonia methane and water
vapor The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its
atmosphere absorbs all other colors Wind speeds range up to 
kilometers  miles per hour and temperatures near the cloud
tops average  degrees Celsius  degrees Fahrenheit

     Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of
photochemical smog believed to be a combination of acetylene
ethane and other sunlightgenerated chemicals Surrounding the
planet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into
space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as electroglow

     Approximately  kilometers  miles below Uranus'
cloud tops there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and
dissolved ammonia some  kilometers  miles deep
Beneath this ocean is an Earthsized core of heavier materials

     Voyager  discovered  new moons  kilometers 
miles in diameter orbiting Uranus The five previously known 
Miranda Ariel Umbriel Titania and Oberon  range in size from
 to  kilometers  to  miles across Representing
a geological showcase these five moons are halfice halfrock
spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past
activity including faulting and ice flows

     The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda Its surface
features high cliffs as well as canyons craterpocked plains and
winding valleys The sharp variations in terrain suggest that
after the moon formed it was smashed apart by a collision with
another body  an event not unusual in our solar system which
contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments
from large impacts What is extraordinary is that Miranda
apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in
its interior exposed on its surface

     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings Voyager  imaged
 In contrast to Saturn's rings which are composed of bright
particles Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark
bouldersized chunks
     

Neptune

     Voyager  completed its year tour of the solar system
with an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons On
August   the spacecraft swept to within  kilometers
 miles of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton
During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's
atmosphere was more active than Uranus' 

     Voyager  observed the Great Dark Spot a circular storm the
size of Earth in Neptune's atmosphere Resembling Jupiter's
Great Red Spot the storm spins counterclockwise and moves
westward at almost  kilometers  miles per hour Voyager
 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fastmoving cloud dubbed
the Scooter as well as highaltitude clouds over the main
hydrogen and helium cloud deck The highest wind speeds of any
planet were observed up to  kilometers  miles per
hour

     Like the other giant planets Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen
and helium upper layer over a liquid interior The planet's core
contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the
other gas giants Neptune's distinctive blue appearance like
Uranus' blue color is due to atmospheric methane

     Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's
spin axis and is not centered at the core This phenomenon is
similar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of
the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores
where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the
electrical properties of a metal Earth's magnetic field on the
other hand is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only
slightly tilted and offset relative to its center

     Voyager  also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings
Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of
material in orbit around the giant planet It was not clear how
Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from
spreading out into even unclumped rings Voyager  detected
these arcs but they were in fact part of thin complete rings
A number of small moons could explain the arcs but such bodies
were not spotted

     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in
 and Nereid in  Voyager  found six more One of the new
moons  Proteus  is actually larger than Nereid but since
Proteus orbits close to Neptune it was lost in the planet's
glare for observers on Earth

      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six
days Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly
towards the planet In  to  million years a short time in
astronomical terms the moon will be so close that Neptunian
gravity will tear it apart forming a spectacular ring to
accompany the planet's modest current rings

     Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of
Io and Miranda The moon has more rock than its counterparts at
Saturn and Uranus Triton's mantle is probably composed of
waterice but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and
methane The moon shows two dramatically different types of
terrain the socalled cantaloupe terrain and a receding ice
cap 

     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap These streaks are the
fallout from geyserlike volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas
and dark finegrained particles to heights of  to  kilometers
 to  miles Triton's thin atmosphere only th as
thick as Earth's has winds that carry the dark particles and
deposit them as streaks on the ice cap  the coldest surface yet
found in the solar system  degrees Celsius  degrees
Fahrenheit Triton might be more like Pluto than any other
object spacecraft have so far visited
     

Pluto

     Pluto is the most distant of the planets yet the
eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside
Neptune's orbit where it has been since  and where it will
remain until March  Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined 
tilted  degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets

     Discovered in  Pluto appears to be little more than a
celestial snowball The planet's diameter is calculated to be
approximately  kilometers  miles only twothirds the
size of our Moon Groundbased observations indicate that Pluto's
surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin
atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet
moves away from the Sun Observations also show that Pluto's spin
axis is tipped by  degrees 

     The planet has one known satellite Charon discovered in
 Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's the
moon appears to be covered with waterice rather than methane
ice Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto so both
bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other Pluto's
and Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution
are all  Earth days 

     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto NASA is
currently exploring the possibility of such a mission
     

Comets

     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a
visit to the inner planets As asteroids are the rocky and
metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system comets
are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only
far from the Sun Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud a
loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching
perhaps halfway to the nearest star

     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are
gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close
to the Sun As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer
planets the volatile elements of which it is made gradually
warm by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner
planets these volatile elements are boiling The nucleus itself
is irregular and only a few miles across and is made principally
of waterice with methane and ammonia  materials very similar
to those composing the moons of the giant planets

     As these materials boil off of the nucleus they form a coma
or cloudlike head that can measure tens of thousands of
kilometers across The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the
Sun The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes
on this cloud blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving
rise to the comet's tails Gases and ions are blown directly
back from the nucleus but dust particles are pushed more slowly
As the nucleus continues in its orbit the dust particles are
left behind in a curved arc

     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun in
effect the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun
The tails can reach  million kilometers  million miles in
length but the total amount of material contained in this
dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase Comets 
from the Latin cometa meaning longhaired  are essentially
dramatic light shows

     Some comets pass through the solar system only once but
others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close
encounter with one of the giant outer planets These latter
visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return
to the inner solar system

     Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively
short period comet returning on an average of once every 
years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit
Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to  BC This regular
visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley
because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return
based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion His name
became part of astronomical lore when in  the comet
returned on schedule Unfortunately Sir Edmond did not live to
see it

     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes
comparatively close to Earth Unfortunately on its most recent
appearance Halley's Comet passed no closer than  million
kilometers  million miles from our world The comet was
visible to the naked eye especially for viewers in the southern
hemisphere but it was not spectacular Comets have been so
bright on rare occasions that they were visible during daytime
Historically comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens
and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky

     The Comet RendezvousAsteroid Flyby CRAF spacecraft will
become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and
remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun CRAF
will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing
sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and
form a coma and tails Several spacecraft have flown by comets at
high speed the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer
in  An armada of five spacecraft two Japanese two Soviet
and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency flew by
Halley's Comet in 
     

Conclusion

     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of
space through an obscuring atmosphere scientists of the past had
only one body they could study closely  Earth But since 
spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our
neighbors in space 

     We have learned more about our solar system and its members
than anyone had in the previous thousands of years Our automated
spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets
beyond our world except Pluto they have observed moons as large
as small planets flown by comets and sampled the solar
environment Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of
bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for
generations We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange
and beautiful places and objects

     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar
system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and
meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called
comparative planetology By studying the geology of planets
moons asteroids and comets and comparing differences and
similarities we are learning more about the origin and history
of these bodies and the solar system as a whole

     We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather
systems By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by
investigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the
solar system we can better understand climatic conditions and
processes on Earth

     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated
spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space One current mission
is mapping Venus others are flying between worlds and will reach
the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments Future
missions are planned for Mars Saturn a comet and the asteroid
belt

     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once
again set foot on an alien world Although astronauts have not
been back to the Moon since December  plans are being
formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the
human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian
outposts One day taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a
lunar base or a martian colony

I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay  Most of the deployed
items antennas and especially the solar arays probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position even by hand

No the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch  Indeed this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays since they had to be
retractable as well as extendable and may thus have indirectly contributed
to the arrayflapping problems

The retrieval problems are exactly as stated  it would be costly would
involve extensive downtime and the worry of someone finding a reason not
to relaunch it and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot
of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination

Sorry to split hairs but I just read in The making of the atomic
bomb that teflon was developed during world war   A sealant was
needed for the tubing in which uranium hexafluoride passed as it was
gradually enriched by difussion  UF is very corrosive and some very
inert yet flexible material was needed for the seals

To split a split hair I believe that teflon CF monomer was
discovered by accident when someone I don't remember
found what he thought was a liquid or gas had turned to a
solid

It just happend to fit the bill for the above use

Idea for repair of satellites

Warning I am getting creative again

Why not build a inflatable space dock

Basically deploy one side of the space dock using a scissor shaped structure
saw it on beyond  then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then
move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it
The inflate the dock with a gas is does not have to be oxygen just neeeds to
be nonflameble nondamaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat
thenheat the space dock for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite
to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit but a much striped
down own 

I know this might take a slot of work or not Or just to plain wierd but
ideas need to be thought of for where is tomorrow but in the imagination of
the present

I feel compelled to complain the statement that recent observations
rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gammaray bursts is
utterly false even though it is popular enough to make it to
BATSE press releases
The idea behind the statement is as follows 
     if you smack two neutron
      stars together or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole
      a lot of energy is released enough for a gammaray burst at a
      cosmological distance But so the reasoning continues this energy 
      is released below a lot of matter so the radiation becomes
      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum
      The observed spectra are strongly nonthermal so this model must
      be wrong
As so often the fault lies with the imagination of the person who
was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model It
may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gammaray
burst but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created
may spew out a relativistic flow When this slams into the surrounding 
medium a strong flux of nonthermal gamma rays results which may
carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy All
this is not my idea it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees
Peter Meszaros sorry for the missing accents and coworkers
It is certainly not a complete model but it may well be the best one
around summing over all proposed distance scales An alternative
proposal for what creates the initial fireball by the way is the 
socalled 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley in which
a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black
hole If the stellar core was rotating part of the infalling matter
will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal
force and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the
black hole This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis
which again constitutes relativistic flow The rate of such
events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers
but the flux may be more strongly beamed so that the net rate
of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two
scenarios but the energy released per event can be a lot less
in the failed supernova scenario

On another note I do believe that the distance scale must 
ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method
such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths
or finding a definitive signature of some known class of
objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes Theorists
have historically not been too successfull in finding the
distance of any object by proving that there is only one
possible way in which the object can work and therefore
it must be soandso

 If you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in

I disagree with what to tout although I agree that the space program is
inherently a good thing  Most people today only care about what will it
cost me and what's in it for me and could care less about whether
something is simply worthwhile in and of itself  Our society has become
increasingly geared toward the shortterm which you could read as NOW 
They couldn't care less about next week much less next century  They want
something to show for the expenditure and they want it now

I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level  You assume
that the general public can't handle the truth and then based on this 
assumption go for the fluff arguments  Then someone who can understand a
good argument comes along and asks why don't you just develop the spinoffs
or why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program like the
military  There are some good arguments for space development without relying
on its side effects  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs  I simply think
that the general public deserves more credit than you give them

BTW don't forget Velcro

And if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right
Teflon has been around since before NASA  As I understand it Velcro was 
conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the
trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes  Certainly velcro was 
available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties  I would need to 
see some good evidence before I believe that either of these would not be here
today without NASA

Being wierd again so be warned

Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to
keep watch I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion

How about a mission unmanned to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things
around and near and on Pluto I know it is a strange idea but why not
It could do some scanning of not only Pluto but also of the solar system
objects near and aaroundpluto as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy
without having much of the solar system to worry about

Do you know of the worldwideweb  This is a global hypertext well

about it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of the
other systems being used like WAIS Gopher FTP Archie etc  It
is usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web

If you'd like to explore I'd suggest getting the XMosaic program
written at the NCSA  It's an Xwindows web browser and is pretty
slick  It can understand and cope with more than text gif jpeg mpeg
audio etc  There are other browsers including a textmode browser
for people stuck on a text terminal but I'm most familliar with mosaic

Under the page The WorldWide Web Virtual Library Subject Catalogue
this is available under the Documents menu in mosaic or by any
browser via the URL 
httpinfocernchhypertextDataSourcesbySubjectOverviewhtml 
there is a subject Space Science  Currently this points to a
page under construction with only the NASA JPL FTP archive  I've
volunteered to take over this page and in fact I have a replacement
with all sorts of information pointers mostly gleaned from the
scispace FAQ  As soon as the overworked Subject Catalogue 
maintainer switches the Space Science pointer it'll be visible

If this man Clark is a NASA administrator then god save NASA Of course
the Shuttles record is unrivaled   There is only one Shuttle Furthermore
there is only likely to be one Shuttle now that Hermes and Boron are 
effectively cancelled

These officials should spend more of their time explaining to their
European and Asian partners how we are expected to believe in them
when their paymasters change their minds on major international
projects everytime a new US administration takes office considering
the major impacts this has on the European and Asian Japanese
industry It is also appreciated how this affects American

There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask

  If we encounter a life form during our space exploration how do we
determine if we should capture it imprison it and then discect it

   Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few
years ago  The question was if an alien spacecraft landed in
Washington DC what was the proper organization to deal with it The
State Department alien ambassadors the Defense Department alien
invaders the Immigration and Naturalization Service illegal aliens
the Department of the Interior new nonhuman species etc  It was
very much a question of our perception of the aliens not of anything
intrinsic in their nature  The bibliography for the article cited a
philosophical paper the name and author of which I sadly forget I
believe the author was Italian on what constitutes a legal andor moral
person ie a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a
person  The paper was quite interesting as I recall

  If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly will
we expend resources from earth to help them

   I think you'd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes  The
human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures does
underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges is terrible  The
usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the
culture  This may not always be wrong but that's the way to bet

  With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable
what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought
back or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere

 Being wierd again so be warned

Being what  Oh weird  OK I'm warned

 Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to
 keep watch I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion

Keep watch for what

 How about a mission unmanned to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things
 around and near and on Pluto I know it is a strange idea but why not

Oh the several tens or hundreds of millions of dollars it would cost
to record things there  And I'd prefer a manned mission anyway

 It could do some scanning of not only Pluto but also of the solar system
 objects near and aaroundpluto as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy
 without having much of the solar system to worry about

We've already got a pretty good platform to scan the solar

People who criticize big Government and its projects rarely seem to
have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and
technology  Basically the US Government has gotten into the role of
supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too
longterm  

Historically this role for the US Gov't was forced upon it because
of socialism in other countries  In order for US  industries to
compete with governmentsubsidized foreign competitors the US Gov't
has taken on the role of subisizing bigticket or longlead RD

As a Republican I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve
itself in technology this way  I believe that market forces should
drive technology and the world would be a better place for it  But
the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously or
some countries would have subsidized RD while others would not  So
the US must subsidize because everybody else does  This sounds a
lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations
doesn't it

But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to
costeffectiveness  The general idea is to spend money on new
technology and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture
despite the forces in the business world like the dreaded quarterly
earnings report which erode the ability of US industry to invest in
new technology  And since our goal is to spend money it makes little
sense to try to save money

Of course we could always spend our money more wisely but EVERYBODY
disagrees about that the wisdom should be  

It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control
available in industry today were derived from Government projects
GANTT charts CPM and most of the modern scheduling software comes
from DoD projects and their contractors  The construction industry
has taken these tools to the core of their businesses every large
construction project now uses these tools

No the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch  Indeed this

to the arrayflapping problems


Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable  if the shuttle is going
to retunr the HST  what bother are some arrays  just fit them with a quick release

As for human tolerances the best example of human endurance in terms
of altitude ie low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure
is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt Everest without oxygen assistance
 This is quite a feat of physiological endurance

Indeed so it's at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible  It is
possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude  there
is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere  beyond what is induced
by the Earth's rotation  thanks to the overall circulation pattern of
the atmosphere air cools at poles and descends flowing back to equator
where it is warmed and rises and this helps just enough to make Everest
withoutoxygen feasible  Only just feasible mind you  the guys who did
it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation
and probably incurred some permanent brain damage

do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway  Maybe you have

RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as  days  before
it was listed as  days  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks
to   after simulations indicated  that it was not doable in   

After all the space walking  they are going to  reboost the HST's
orbit  I think right now  it's sitting  at  miles up
they would like    I don't know the exact orbit numbers
I know when HST was first flown it was placed in the Highest
possible Shuttle orbit 

Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet or extended
duration orbiter pallet  It's mostly  LOXLH for the fuel cells
and RCS gear  plus more O  and canisters for the life support
rebreathers  maybe more nitrogen too

THe limit on spacewalking is a function of suit supplies MASS
and Orbiter Duration   

In order to perform the reboost of the HST the OMS engines
will be fired for a long period  Now the shuttle is a heavy
thing  THe HST isn't light either  THe amount of OMS fuel
needed to fly both up is substantial   a small booster
carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly
less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle
for a given orbital change  

From what i understand  the mass margins on the HST missions are
tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's

Now if they used a small tug  I would bet  just a wild guess
that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the
EDO pallet  extra suits  more consumables  parts for the
flaky FGS sensor  parts for the balky solar  electronics

and still enough for a double magnum of champagne

or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit
The reason they want a high orbit is less antenna pointing
and longer drag life

 and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables
 so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the
 array tilt motors  and god knows what else  is going to wear out

From what I've heard the motors are fine  it is one of the two 
sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix  The 
motors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware  I expect 
to be corrected if I'm wrong on this

Whatever it is  the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint

I haven't seen any mention of this in a while so here goes

When the Hubble Telescope was first deployed one of its high gain antennas
was not able to be moved across its full range of motion  It was suspected
that it had been snagged on a cable or something  Operational procedures
were modified to work around the problem and later problems have overshadowed
the HGA problem

Is there any plan to look at the affected HGA during the HST repair mission
to determine the cause of its limited range of motion  Is the affected HGA
still limited or is it now capable of full range of motion

Why not build a inflatable space dock

If you're doing largescale satellite servicing being able to do it in
a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense  The question is whether
anyone is going to be doing largescale satellite servicing in the near
future to the point of justifying development of such a thing

inflate the dock with a gas is does not have to be oxygen just neeeds to
be nonflameble nondamaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat

You'd almost certainly use air  Given that you have to pressurize with
something safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable
even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing
to avoid needing a ventilation system it's nice if the hangar atmosphere
is breathable in a pinch  it makes mask functioning much less critical

Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to
keep watch 

There would be some point to doing longterm monitoring of things like
particles and fields not to mention atmospheric phenomena  However
there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network
To be precise there is no particular plan period  This is a large
part of the problem  In this context it's not surprising that unexciting
but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time  The closest
approach to any sort of longterm planetary monitoring mission is the
occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier
mission like Galileo or Cassini

How about a mission unmanned to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things
around and near and on Pluto

It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be
worth monitoring and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly
without new propulsion technology something the planetary community
has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for  The combined need to
arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time and then kill nearly
all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit is beyond what can
reasonably be done with current that is svintage propulsion

It could do some scanning of not only Pluto but also of the solar system
objects near and aaroundpluto as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy
without having much of the solar system to worry about

Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth  The few things
that can't be can be done better from a Voyagerlike spacecraft that is
not constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet

 THe limit on spacewalking is a function of suit supplies MASS
 and Orbiter Duration   

 In order to perform the reboost of the HST the OMS engines
 will be fired for a long period  Now the shuttle is a heavy
 thing  THe HST isn't light either  THe amount of OMS fuel
 needed to fly both up is substantial   a small booster
 carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly
 less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle
 for a given orbital change  

 From what i understand  the mass margins on the HST missions are
 tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's

 pat

I haven't seen any specifics on the HST repair mission but I can't see why
the mass margins are tight  What are they carrying up  Replacement components
WFPC II COSTAR gyros solar panels and probably a few others all sorts of
tools EVA equipment and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can  This
should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission which achieved the
highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date  And HST is now in a lower 
orbit  

Seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity

 Also as implied by other posters why 
do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway 

You don't need to but it's desirable  HST like all satellites in
low Earth orbit is gradually losing altitude due to air drag  It was
deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach for that reason
It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter  It has
no propulsion system of its own  This is an excellent opportunity
given that there may not be another visit for several years

richmondspiffPrincetonEDU Stupendous Man writes 
    If that's the case let me point out that interstellar dust and 
 molecules provide many instances of things that are well nottoofar
 from being blackbodies  Many different observations including IRAS
 and COBE have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
 can range from K to K

Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies  The large
grains have sizes of order  micron and absorb visible light with
fair efficiency  However at temperatures below  K  of the
thermal emission will be beyond  microns where radiating
efficiency is poor  A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long
wavelengths  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate
the energy they have absorbed

Moreover the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 
microns  Grains colder than  K will radiate primarily at longer
wavelengths and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them  In
the extreme limit grains as cold as  K will be almost undetectable
by any conceivable observation

Worse still IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a
population of small grains  These grains have only perhaps 
atoms and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to
temperatures of several hundred or  K  Of course they cool
quickly and then stay cold for a while but when they are radiating
the characteristic temperature is several hundred K  Even a small
population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed
average temperature

A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has
three components  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal
dust color temperature  K thermal emission from Zodiacal dust
Tc   K and thermal emission from Galactic dust Tc K  At
the ecliptic poles the emissivities or dilution factors are
respectively E E and E  The first two are roughly
doubled in the ecliptic plane

To find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution
factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components then
take the fourth root  In the table below starlight comes from
Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent
to  zero mag stars with BV color of   No doubt careful work
could do much better  The person who suggested starlight had a
dilution factor of E must have been remembering wrong  We would be
cooked if that were the case  In any event the energy density of
starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave
background and I believe that to be correct

                         Dilution   Temp   DT
Microwave background                      
Galactic dust              E              
Zodiacal dust emission   E           
Zodiacal dust scattering E         
Starlight                  E          
                                           
                                             

The fourth root of  is  K  Outside the Solar system the
result would be  K  

I find these results surprising especially the importance of
Zodiacal dust but I don't see any serious mistakes

We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a
tether attached to an orbiting platform  This will be a follow on to our
succesful deployment of a  kilometer tether on the March  flight of
SEDS Small Expendable Deployment System which released an instrumented
payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west
coast of Mexico  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered
We want to build it from off the shelf technology so as to do this as
quickly and inexpensively as possible  We want to be able to track the
payload after it has deployed its parachute  An idea we have is to put the
same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs Search and Rescue
Satellites  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in
tracking  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs
Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon  They are rugged they have to
be to survive a ship wreck and cheap  We have several questions

  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons  Are
there multiple authorites ie military and civilian

  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals  Can they
be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the
relevant authorities or are they strictly reserved for life threatening
emergencies

  What is the coverage of SARSATS  Are they in LEO with only intermittant
coverage of a fixed position on the earth or are they in geosynchronous
orbit

  Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of
these transponders

I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers

Let me give you an example  When you watch TV they have commercials to pay
for the programming  You accept that as part of watching  If you don't like
it you can turn it off  If you want to view the night sky and there is a
floating billboard out there you can't turn it off  It's the same 
reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas

And if you want to view that television station you have to watch the
commercials  You can't turn them off and still be viewing the
television station  In other words if you don't like what you see
don't look  There is no 'right' I can think of that you have to force
other people to conform to your idea of aesthetic behaviour  What's
next laws regulating how people must dress and look so as to appeal
to your fashion sense since you have this 'right' of an aesthetic
view

Which has what to do with the topic of discussion

Pat says
If you really are annoyed   get some legislation
to create a dark sky zone  where in all light emissions are protected
in the zone  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone  Did you
know about that  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia
they have a  mile EMCON zone  Theoretically they can prevent
you from running light AC motors like air conditioners and Vacuums
In practice they use it mostly to  control  large radio users

I say
What I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that presumably
would move around in the sky  I for one am against legislating
at all  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy and
would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
aesthetic values that make us human  This includes the need for wild
and unspoiled things including the night sky

Oh I see  You don't want any legislation that might impinge on you
you just want everyone else on the planet to do what you want

Re Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO 
As far as single stage to orbit technology we think that we have
a better answer in a two stage approach and we are talking to some
of our customers about that  As far as commercialization that is
a long ways off  
 Anybody know anything further Is this really news Does this
threaten further work on DC 
  
   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried
out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some
time  A good reference on this might be Comparison of Propulsion
Options for Advanced EarthToOrbit ETO Applications IAF
 by VA Weldon and LE Fink from Boeing   The paper
describes a propanefueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve
aircraftlike operational efficiencies without the problems
associated with liquid hydrogen fuel  Basically it's a highspeed
airplane launching a Hermestype spaceplane
   The design the concept is also called Beta as laid out in the
paper can launch at least  pounds into polar orbit or 
pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and
life support  System design reliability is 
   Beta is a footlong first stage powered by two large ramjets
and  high speed civil transport HSCT turbofans  A foot
long reusable orbiter is trapezemounted in the belly of the first
stage aircraft which also could accommodate a longer and heavy
payload on an expendable second stage
   To launch the orbital vehicle the first stage takes off like a
normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach   At that point the turbofans
modified to burn catalyzed JP would shut off and the ramjets
would take over  At Mach  the orbiter or the ELV would swing
out ignite and proceed to orbit Both vehicles would land like
aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions
   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff
is about  M lbs roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An
The orbiter stages weighs about Klbs including  Klbs
of LOX and subcooled propane to power two  Klbs vacuum thrust
rocket engines Propellants would be stored at  degrees Kelvin
with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the by
foot cargo bay and the twoseat orbiter crew station LOX would
be stored aft  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's
success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact
tankage allowed by the highdensity supercooled hydrocarbon fuel
     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design  They conclude
while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost a TSTO is easier
cheaper and less risky to develop simpler to build has greater
safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hardtohandle
and bulky hydrogen fuel The conlcude In conjunction with its major
use of airplane type engines and fuel as well as its inherent self
ferry capability it is probably the system most likely to provide
as close to airlinelike operations as possible with a practical
configuration until a single stage airbreatherrocket concept can
be shown to be operationally viable
  
Is this really news Does this threaten further work on DC
   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for
some time  I expect this or a similar concept perhaps the HTHL
SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase is being re
examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter
   Does it threaten DC  Possibly  There is a set of ongoing
studies trying straighten out the government's future space
transportation strategy  MDC and Boeing as well as other firms
are providing data to a joint study team back in DC  There are
various factions and options vying for attention  including
shuttle upgrades shuttle replacement what was called the 
architecture SpaceLifter ELV upgrades and various advanced
vehicles ALES Beta DC NASP FSTS SSTOs of several types
etc  NASADODDOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy
for future US gov't space transportation systems and trying to
juggle nearterm launch needs like for DoD and NASA against
mediumterm needs including commercial considerations and against
the investment and risk of going to leap frog new technologies
like SDIOSSTO and NASP and Beta
   It's a heck of a problem  The worst part of the problem isn't
that there aren't promising ideas and concepts  there are dozens
of them  but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in
the near term  They should have a draft report in midJune with a
final report coming by the end of the fiscal year

 After all the space walking  they are going to  reboost the HST's
 orbit  I think right now  it's sitting  at  miles up
 they would like    I don't know the exact orbit numbers

As Ben says  this reboost idea is all news to us here  Do you know 
something we don't  Please supply a source  it would be nice for 
the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to 
be  These altitude numbers are also way off  

My best source has 
Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is     Kilometers
Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is     Kilometers
Delta   ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is       Kilometers 

PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base  used to schedule observations 


 In order to perform the reboost of the HST the OMS engines
 will be fired for a long period  Now the shuttle is a heavy
 thing  THe HST isn't light either  THe amount of OMS fuel
 needed to fly both up is substantial   a small booster
 carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly
 less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle
 for a given orbital change  
 

Could you supply some calculations  You might check some recent 
postings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does 
not now exist so comparing the mass of something that doesn't 
exist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems impossible  The contamination 
threat also remains  

 
 
 or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit
 The reason they want a high orbit is less antenna pointing
 and longer drag life
 
  Longer drag life I can understand but could you explain the 
antenna pointing  

 Whatever it is  the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint
 on HST ops

Tell me about it  Although the arrays can be and are moved perfectly 
well utilizing the second electronics box  Getting them both working 
is much desireable so as to reclaim redundancy  

 
 pat
 

I don't mean to jump on you  helpful suggestions are always welcome 
and we all know the more ideas the better but I do want the true 
situation to be described clearly and correctly lest some get 
confused

 I haven't seen any specifics on the HST repair mission but I can't see why
 the mass margins are tight  What are they carrying up  Replacement components
 WFPC II COSTAR gyros solar panels and probably a few others all sorts of
 tools EVA equipment and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can  This
 should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission which achieved the
 highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date  And HST is now in a lower 
 orbit  
 
 Seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity

One thing to recall  Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing 
Coming back to not only that altitude but matching the position of it in 
its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing  Any misalignment of the 
plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will 
require more fuel to adjust  This was considered in the original deployment 

I agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous  
One has to admire how much they are trying to do

I just wanted to point out that Teflon wasn't from the space program
It was from the WWII nuclear weapons development program  Pipes in the 
system for fractioning and enriching uranium had to be lined with it

Uranium Hexafloride was the chemical they turned the pitchblend into for
enrichment  It is massively corrosive  Even to Stainless steels Hence
the need for a very inert substaance to line the pipes with  Teflon has
all its molecular sockets bound up already so it is very unreactive

Given that what i described for the HST  seemed to be the SMT   and given
the mass amrgins on the discovery mission  is tight enough that  spacewalking
has to be carefully constrained  No EDO pallets  no spare Suits
no extra MMU's   

Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this
mission  You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence  

WHy not do this

	Quick Test  Goldins philosophjy  of faster cheaper better

Build a real fast Space TUg  to handle the reboost  of the HST  using
clean Cryo fuels  and get it ready before the  HST mission

Pat this would be slower more expensive and worse  

Slower  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December  That's less
than eight months away  There is no way you could build new hardware retrain
and reschedule the EVA's in that time

More Expensive  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
was going to do execpt fire the OMS  In addition you've added significant
extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware


According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me there are
only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle  HST and
AXAF  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle
there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle

 of something going terribly wrong with the launch resulting in the
 complete loss of the new modular space station not just a peice of

 I certainly like this Option C  It's much more like the original

This is actually more like the stuff from Phase A and MOLPhase B ended
with a Power Tower approach

It's also VERY expensive in terms of upfront development costsso all
you get is a redistribution of costs from the shuttle flights to the
contractors who build it

I'm wondering if vandalize is the proper word to use in this situation  My
dictionary defines vandalism as the willful or malicious destructuion of 
public or private property especially of anything beautiful or artisitc I
would agree the sky is beautiful but not that it is public or private property

It's public because it belongs to everybody 

No the sky does not at this time belong to anyone  Ownership is necessary
to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the
action was good or bad  If neither you or I own a brick wall then I can't
unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right and you don't
have the authority to declare that it is wrong  The owner may find it artistic
or she may be call the police

this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights

It's vandalism because many people  power companies  do maliciously waste light 

maliciously implies evil intent  The lighting companies aren't going out
of their way to spoil the sky  They just don't care

If they can sell you
or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes  to  percent
of its light they make more money  Never mind that your money is wasted

It is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware
If that's what your city will buy that's what the lighting company will sell

No the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch  Indeed this

Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable  if the shuttle is going

They can be detached in an emergency  But expensive hardware is not thrown
away casually bearing in mind that nobody knew the design was defective
If the deployment crew had found some nasty flaw  the lid failing to open

                             April  
                               AM PDT

DSS Madrid  meter antenna did not acquire the expected Mars Observer
Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning 
at approximately  AM  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
telemetry at the end of the previous station pass DSS  Goldstone 
meter antenna at approximately  PM the evening before  Entry into
Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning  After subsystem engineers
reported all systems performing nominally fault protection telemetry modes
were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and
AACS Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem Starex performed  These
readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after  AM
yesterday   Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check
failure triggered fault protection  However the Flight Team will be
determining the precise cause over the next few days

As of last evening the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial
Reference and was stable in that mode  The Flight Team is planning to
command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today

Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency
Mode entry  MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape
Recorders  and   Playback of DTRs  and  scheduled to be completed
yesterday was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight
Sequence C execution  The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart
C to complete data playback  Present planning is to perform playbacks
between  as soon as Wednesday or as late as Friday of next week 
 dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity  DTR playback will
be performed via the High Gain Antenna at  bits per second  Upon
verification of successful DTR playbacks downlink will be maintained at
the K S  E rate

As for human tolerances the best example of human endurance in terms
of altitude ie low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure
is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt Everest without oxygen assistance
 This is quite a feat of physiological endurance

Indeed so it's at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible  It is
possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude  there
is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere  beyond what is induced
by the Earth's rotation  thanks to the overall circulation pattern of
the atmosphere air cools at poles and descends flowing back to equator
where it is warmed and rises and this helps just enough to make Everest
withoutoxygen feasible  Only just feasible mind you  the guys who did
it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation
and probably incurred some permanent brain damage

Climbers regard  metres and up as The Death Zone  Even on  Oxygen
you are slowly dying  At m Everest most climbers spend only a short
period of time before descending  I've been above  once  Descending as
little as m feels like walking into a jungle the air is so thick  Everest

Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to
keep watch I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion

We've been progressing towards that goal for  years now  We precede
any orbiting mission with flyby missions  Of course it gets harder to
do as we work our way farther away from Earth  We're just starting to
work out to the outer planets Galileo will orbit Jupiter and Cassini around 
Saturn  

How about a mission unmanned to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things
around and near and on Pluto 

Well first things first We'll do a flyby mission first since it is
much easier and faster to do  If the Fast Pluto Flyby mission is approved then
we'll launch a Pluto mission before the end of the decade  A Pluto orbiter
however requires a larger spacecraft and a longer cruise period   Orbit
insertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts the
trajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto
I'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbiting
mission before a Pluto orbiting mission unless the Pluto flyby turns
up something really interesting

No the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch  Indeed this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays since they had to be
retractable as well as extendable and may thus have indirectly contributed
to the arrayflapping problems


Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable  if the shuttle is going
to retunr the HST  what bother are some arrays  just fit them with a quick
 release  one  space walk  or use the second canadarm to remove the arrays

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost
and you don't want to clip off the panels each time

For the GammaRay Observatory one of the design requirements was that
there be no storedenergy mecahnisms springs explosive squibs gas shocks
etc used for deployment  This was partially so that everything could
be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay and partially for
safety considerations  I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile
would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened

Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to
orbit of  per pound  everybody designed things for easy servicing

    Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few
 years ago  The question was if an alien spacecraft landed in
 Washington DC what was the proper organization to deal with it The
 State Department alien ambassadors the Defense Department alien
 invaders the Immigration and Naturalization Service illegal aliens
 the Department of the Interior new nonhuman species etc  It was
 very much a question of our perception of the aliens not of anything
 intrinsic in their nature  The bibliography for the article cited a
 philosophical paper the name and author of which I sadly forget I
 believe the author was Italian on what constitutes a legal andor moral
 person ie a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a
 person  The paper was quite interesting as I recall

This is a whole different situation  If aliens were able to get here prior
to us being able to get there one might conclude that they would be more advanced
and therefore more intelegent that we are  However if we get somewhere where there
is life chances are we wont be able to communicate with them  So we will have
no clue as to weather they are intelegent or not

    I think you'd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes  The
 human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures does
 underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges is terrible  The
 usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the
 culture  This may not always be wrong but that's the way to bet

That's a good point I hadn't thought of it that way  My question however was
more along the lines of Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars
and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign
countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night
Would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn't resolved
these issues on our own


But Your comment brings up another good question  Over the years we have decided
that certain cultures need improvements  The native americans is a good example  Prior
to our attempt to civilize them the native american culture had very little crime no
homelessnes no poverty  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and
more  If we encounter life elsewhere do we tell them they have to live in houses farm
the land and go to church on sunday

 After all the space walking  they are going to  reboost the HST's
 orbit  I think right now  it's sitting  at  miles up
 they would like    I don't know the exact orbit numbers
					

As Ben says  this reboost idea is all news to us here  Do you know 
something we don't  Please supply a source  it would be nice for 
the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to 
be  These altitude numbers are also way off  

My best source has 
Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is     Kilometers
Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is     Kilometers
Delta   ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is       Kilometers 

PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base  used to schedule observations 



I am sure your numbers are far better then mine  As i said above
i don't have exact numbers

 In order to perform the reboost of the HST the OMS engines
 will be fired for a long period  Now the shuttle is a heavy
 thing  THe HST isn't light either  THe amount of OMS fuel
 needed to fly both up is substantial   a small booster
 carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly
 less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle
 for a given orbital change  
 

Could you supply some calculations  You might check some recent 
postings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does 
not now exist so comparing the mass of something that doesn't 
exist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems impossible  The contamination 
threat also remains  


How different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug
be from that of the Shuttle and it's OMS engines

I know that no small manuevering tug exists  but maybe  one could
soup up a Bus    Does anyone out there have the declasified
specs on hte BUS   would it be able to provide enough  control
force to balance the HST  and  still have the rocket thrust
to hurl her into a decent high orbit

 
 
 or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit
 The reason they want a high orbit is less antenna pointing
 and longer drag life
 
  Longer drag life I can understand but could you explain the 
antenna pointing  

Sorry  that should be intrument pointing


 Whatever it is  the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint
 on HST ops

Tell me about it  Although the arrays can be and are moved perfectly 
well utilizing the second electronics box  Getting them both working 
is much desireable so as to reclaim redundancy  

Plus if the second box gets fritzy you could be in shitter ville
real fast


I don't mean to jump on you  helpful suggestions are always welcome 
and we all know the more ideas the better but I do want the true 
situation to be described clearly and correctly lest some get 
confused 

Regards 
Wm Hathaway 

The problem is noone seems to have the exact numbers  When the mission
was planned originally at  spacewalks  and  astronauts  there was
enormous concern over the mass margins for the flight  THey
have now planned for  EVA's  an  day mission and have  reserve
EVA's and an emergency EVA  Obviously that is coming from somewhere
My guess is the OMS burn  fuel  or  reboost  margin   

I just figured if GOldin wants to really  prove out faster cheaper
better   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable
space manuevering tug  out of a BUs  and use that for the reboost
it has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck

 COMMERCIAL SPACE NEWSSPACE TECHNOLOGY INVESTOR NUMBER 

    This might point out some key discriminators in judging the 
 feasibility of a commercial launch site  These include
    Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage 
 sufficient to recover setup costs
    Is there a market advantage of using the site
    Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site
    Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the 
 investment  
    Other commercial launch site ventures  including those at 
 Woomera Poker Flat Cape York White Sands Alabama OffShore 
 Platform Hawaii and Vandenberg have to also be judged against 
 these criteria  In my opinion some of these ventures are flying 
 on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds

This reminds me my fuzzy brain recalls that somebody was thinking
of reviving the San Marco launch platform off the coast of Kenya
where the Copernicus satellite was launched around   Is this
true or am I imagining it  Possibly it's connected with one of the
Italian programs to revive the Scout in a new version

Picture our universe floating like a log
in a river  As the log floats down the
river it occasionally strikes rocks the
bank the bottom other logs  When this collission
occurs kinetic energy is translated into heat the
log degrades gets scraped up and other energy 
translaions occur  The distribution of damage to
the log depends on the shape of the log

However to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a
termite in the center of the log the shock waves from the
collissions would appear uniformly random in direction

This is my theory for GRB  They are evidence of our universe
interacting with other universes  Why not  Makes
just as much sense as the GRB coming from the Oort cloud

The log theory of universes can't be ruled out

Of course I'm a layman in the physics world  You 
physicists out there Tell me about this

First you need to do the literature search  There is a lot of information
out there  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation
This could be useful especially if we make it available on the net  Then
we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies

Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to 
ourselves as space advocates
and clearly important to existing space programs
In essence we would be dividing the space life science issues into
various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies
This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the
basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet isunet
and any other source

Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net
I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search 
first  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis  The data
base itself could be useful for future engineers

That's my response Ken what do you think

Tim

Well I agree  I hope others chime in with suggestions on specific
technologies which could be applied towards the maintenance of an
Earth like atmosphere on a longduration spacecraft

Tim et al
I think we should try looking at atmosphere first
This seems to be the single most fundamental issue in keeping anyone alive
We're all taught that when supporting a patient
you look for maintaining airway So in keeping with my trauma training
and keeping my emergency medicine professor happy I suggest that
we look at the issues surrounding a regenerable atmospheric circuit

Howz that Tim

Also ask any electricguitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer and
they'll tell you tubetype since tubes have lower distortion and noise
than transistors  'Course most of your electric guitar types just say
Tubes sound better dude 

Of course  they then  turn up the REverb the Gain  add in the analog
delay line  and the Fuzz box  I'd think they wouldn't notice the
distortion   Oh I forgot the phase shifters

It is kind of absurd isn't it  Some players even want more distortion
especially the Hendrix fans   But there are a lot of them out there
that can only afford the amp or who like playing music without distortion
Then there are your hardcore Hendirx fans that want particular types
of distortion ie they make it not their amps

Also transistors have the advantage in both wasteheat and energyuse
mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes

Ah  but how do they compare to Mechanical systems 

I didn't see a thing about wasteheat from Babbage and haven't seen one
of those mechanical TV's in a while so it's anybodie's guess

Dale sez
Mr Hathaway's post is right on the money if a little lengthy  In short
an orbiting billboard would be trash in the same way that a billboard on
the Earth is trash  Billboards make a place look trashy  That is why there
are laws in many places prohibiting their use  The light pollution
complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain
on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky

I don't buy it  If the things had no value at all people wouldn't
spend money to make them So their lack of value is just your
opinion not an actual fact which is neither a philisophical or
legal basis for prohibiting them

On the other hand I lived in OakBrook IL for a while where zoning

fine law despite it's contradictory basis

I would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would
be violation of private property  I bought this house out in

this billboard has made that investment worthless so I want the

Hi Folks

              Last year America bought two  Hall Generators which are
used as thrusters for space vehicles from former USSRif I could recall
correctly these devices were sent to JPLPasadena labs for testing and
evaluation
     
              I am just curious to know  how these devices work and what
what principle is involved what became of themThere was also some
controversy that the Russian actually cheatedsold inferior devices and
not the one they use in there space vehicles

Any info will be appreciated
  ok                            Thank in advance

How hard or easy would it be to have a combo mission such as a solar sail on
the way out to the outer planets but once in near to orbit to use more normal
means
Seems that everyone talks about using one system and one system only per
mission why not have more than one propulsion system Or did I miss
something  or did it die in committee

Okay the earth has a magnetic field unless someone missed something

Okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field it produces electricty

Now the question Can you use electricity to power a spacelow earth orbit
vehicle and i fyou can can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power
it
Can the idea of a dragless satellite be used in part to create the electrical
field

After all the dragless satellite is I might be wrong a suspended between to
pilons the the pilons compensate for drag I think I know what I want to say
just not sure how to say it

A dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator

Getting wierd again

Okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to Pluto is to large and to
expensive

Okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts Kind of liek the old
MIRV principle of old Cold War Days 
Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
different missionsnamely different planets Each probe would be tied in with
the mother ship or earth as the case may be This is good when and if we go
for Mars the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the
probes

Also the mother ship would be powered if not the Mars Mission by a normal
propulsion but also a solar sail main reason for solar sail race is to see
what can be done and autmoated the sail would get the probes to were they
needed I know the asteroidmeteor clouds and such might get in the way of a 
Sail

Main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send
multiple probesmissionsatellitesexploreres to different places and cut
costs
The probes could do fly bys or  we shall see

I just figured if GOldin wants to really  prove out faster cheaper
better   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable

 Why jettison the SSMEs  Why not hold on to them and have a shuttle 
 bring them down to use as spares

One performance reason comes to mind if you jettison the SSME's you
don't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization
burns  Onorbit SSME's are just dead weight since we don't have an
SSME HO pressurization mechanism which works in zeroG  This means
that you can't use them for reboost or anything else  Dead weight has
a couple of advantages but more disadvantages

Throwaway SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not

failure is too high

  I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like For example is
 there a constant sensation of falling 

Ron Baalke baalkekelvinjplnasagov replied
 Yes weightlessness does feel like falling  It may feel strange at first
 but the body does adjust  The feeling is not too different from that
 of sky diving

I'm no astronaut but I've flown in the KC several times  I'll
tell you about my first flight

At the onset of weightlessness my shoulders lifted and my spine
straightened  I felt a momentary panic and my hands tried to grab
onto something like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor
to prevent me from falling I remember conciously overruling my
involuntary motions  My ears felt not heard a rush and I could
feel fluid moving in my head like when you get up from bed while
you have a cold

At that point I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response
since I had some science to do  I was busy keeping my experiment
going and keeping track of all the parts during the return of
gravity and subsequent G pullout so I didn't really pay
attention to physiology at that time

After about  parabolas I discovered that I was performing one
of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion
sickness I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly
 all except my hands and arms which needed to be in rapid
concious motion for my experiment  During the pullout to
parabola  my queasiness finally started to get to me and I
had to use one of those airsickness bags  I was basically
useless for the rest of that flight so I went to the seats in
the back of the plane while my partner whom I drafted for just
this purpose kept working on the experiment while I was ill
He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider one of those anomalous
people who don't get sick on the thing

I didn't think of it as a constant sensation of falling so
much as like swimming in air  It's very close to the sensations
I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up

Jerry
 And what is the motion sickness
 that some astronauts occasionally experience 

Ron
 It is the body's reaction to a strange environment  It appears to be
 induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress
 Some people are more prone to it than others like some people are more
 prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others  The mental
 part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is
 up or down ie the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay
 pointed towards Earth so the Earth or ground is above the head of
 the astronauts  About  of the astronauts experience some form of
 motion sickness and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to
 see how to keep the number of occurances down

I'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do
among other things some of the tests Ron mentions  I was in one
called the Preflight Adaptation Trainer which consisted of a chair on
a severaldegreeoffreedom motion base with moving geometric visual
aids  The goal was to measure the victim'sHHHHHHHH subject's
responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated
exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness
symptoms

Jerry 

I don't know of any former or activeduty astronauts who personally
read this group  I know that Bruce McCandless's office had been
waiting anxiously for the Space Station Redesign option I posted
last week but I don't think Bruce reads the group himself

 Why not build a inflatable space dock

Henry Spencer henryzootorontoedu wrote
 If you're doing largescale satellite servicing being able to do it in
 a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense  The question is whether
 anyone is going to be doing largescale satellite servicing in the near
 future to the point of justifying development of such a thing

That's a mighty fine idea  But since you asked Why not I'll
respond

Putting aside the application of such a space dock there are other
factors to consider than just pressurized volume  Temperature control
is difficult in space and your inflatable hangar will have to 
incorporate thermal insulation maybe a doublewalled inflatable
Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required
Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble it's more likely
to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multilayer
fabric that softtorso space suits are made out of today

Because almost all manned space vessels Skylab Mir Salyut used
their pressurization for increased structural rigidity even though
they had have metal skins they still kind of qualify as inflatable

The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled  The
space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials due to
temperature extremes monotomic Oxygen impingement and radiation
effects on materials so your fabric may not retain any flexibility
for long  This may not matter  Even after inflation pressure
changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric which could
lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases

These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal
for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of
success

Just a few contributions from the space program to regular society

	Teflon So your eggs don't stick in the pan

Sorry to split hairs but I just read in The making of the atomic
bomb that teflon was developed during world war   A sealant was
needed for the tubing in which uranium hexafluoride passed as it was
gradually enriched by difussion  UF is very corrosive and some very
inert yet flexible material was needed for the seals

I think you're both right  Teflon was actually discovered by accident
before WWII  From what I've heard they had some chemical I assume it
was tetrafluoroethylene in a tank and but the valve got gummed up
Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized

The material was useful for seals but it had a major problem for say
the linings of vessels it wouldn't stick to metal  What the space
program did was to find a way to get it to stick  Thus we had nostick
frypans on the market in the late 's

to retunr the HST  what bother are some arrays

They can be detached in an emergency  But expensive hardware is not thrown
away casually bearing in mind that nobody knew the design was defective
If the deployment crew had found some nasty flaw  the lid failing to open
for example  it would have been a bit embarrassing to have to throw the
solar arrays away to get the thing back in the payload bay


I guess it's  kind of an aesthetics argument

I can see the solar arrays being expensive  and  there could be
contingencies where you would be throwing away brand new
solar cells   but  it seems so cheap compared toa shuttle
mission i wouldn't think they would bother

Well  you better not get the shuttle as your launch vehicle

and most ELV's have too  far of a backlog for political messages

If during the campaign season  the candidates for president had
launched one  right around now we'd  be getting a launch
for PEROT 

and if they had used the shuttle  we'd be seeing launches
for NIXON now more then ever

Given that what i described for the HST  seemed to be the SMT   and given

has to be carefully constrained  No EDO pallets  no spare Suits
no extra MMU's   

Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this
mission  You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence  


Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins
on the HST reboost mission  A while back i had asked why not carry
the EDO pallet up  and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough they weren't even carrying extra suits

WHy not do this

Build a real fast Space TUg  to handle the reboost  of the HST  using
clean Cryo fuels  and get it ready before the  HST mission

Pat this would be slower more expensive and worse  

Slower  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December  That's less
than eight months away  There is no way you could build new hardware retrain
and reschedule the EVA's in that time


Where's wingo when you need him

COme on   Knock that ST off

YOu forget  that during skylab  they did  overnight mission planning
for the repair EVA's   Also during the   
Intelsat Mission   they did overnight  WETF simulations
I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in   months

And as for building hardware  anything can  be built if you want it
bad enough

YOu forget  the  BUS   is already built  all they'd ahve to do
is soup it up even test it  on a delta mission

Don't get into this mode of  negativism   besides  at the rate

More Expensive  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
was going to do execpt fire the OMS  In addition you've added significant
extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware


Ah  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission

YOu forget  there is a bum FGS  the Solar array electronics are
getting hinky  and there is still  months until the servicing mission

The time for the space walks are growing rapidly  THis was orignally
planned out as  spacewalks  now they are at  EVA's  with  reserve
walks

If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's  million
saved  If the Weight savings  means they  can sit on orbit  for  Days
and  handle any contingency  problems  that's quite a savings


According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me there are
only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle  HST and
AXAF  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle
there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle


Of course  there wasn't any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too

as for the problems with the aperture door  I am sure they can

How hard or easy would it be to have a combo mission such as a solar sail on
the way out to the outer planets but once in near to orbit to use more normal
means

If you've got a good propulsion system that's not useful for deceleration
sure you can use chemical rockets for that part but even just doing the
deceleration chemically is a major headache  We're talking seriously high
cruising velocities taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto
orbit isn't easy with chemical fuels

Incidentally solar sails are not going to be suitable as the acceleration
system for something like this  They don't go anywhere quickly  I speak
as head of mission planning for the Canadian Solar Sail Project although
that is more or less an honorary title right now because CSSP is dormant
They can't fly a mission like this unless you start talking about very
advanced systems that drop in very close to the Sun first

Okay the earth has a magnetic field 
if you put a object in the earth magnetic field it produces electricty

Well it's not that simple  you're in Earth's magnetic field and you
don't generate electricity  but it can be done

Now the question Can you use electricity to power a spacelow earth orbit
vehicle and i fyou can can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power
it

The way you power things is with electricity so the answer to the first
question is definitely yes  If you meant to say propel rather than
power the answer is sort of  Yes you can use interaction with the
Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power and there are potential
applications for this

However bear in mind that there is no free lunch  The energy isn't
coming from nowhere  What such systems do is convert some of the energy
of your orbital velocity into electrical energy  There are cases where
this is a useful tradeoff  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion
is useful only in special situations however

What you can do is get your power by some other means eg solar arrays
and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse pumping energy
into the orbit rather than taking energy out of it

If you want more information trying looking up electrodynamic propulsion
tether applications and magsails

Can the idea of a dragless satellite be used in part to create the
electrical field

No  A dragless satellite does not magically have no drag it burns fuel
constantly to fight drag maintaining the exact orbit it would have if
there was no drag  This is why there are quotes around dragless

Not useful unless you've got some truly wonderful propulsion system for

better to simply launch the probes independently  The outer planets
are scattered widely across a twodimensional solar system and going
to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one  Uranus is not on

Solar sails are pretty useless in the outer solar system  They're also
very slow unless you assume quite advanced versions

No the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch  Indeed this

Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable  if the shuttle is going

I didn't think the bistem design was used so much for the retrieval as
for the ability to launch in a tight size STS envelope  This is my own 
guess based on similar designs flown on other large STSlaunched sc 
GRO UARS  Also there might be some consideration given to mass 
requirements bistems weight less than conventional SA  Finally 
the HST arrays do have the ability to be detachedremember they're 
going to be replaced with new arrays

However as an ACS guy who's seen his branch management pull their
collective hair out over HST I would voice a hearty 'yea' to using
conventional arrays over bistems whenever possible  No half hertz
flexible modes no thermal snap no problem

Okay the earth has a magnetic field unless someone missed something

Okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field it produces electricty

No if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field it produces a voltage
The two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or
move the conductor  The slow shifting of the Earth's magnetic field isn't
really significant especially when you consider how weak the Earth's magnetic
field is to begin with

Now the question Can you use electricity to power a spacelow earth orbit
vehicle and i fyou can can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power
it

Well it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel
the Earth's magnetic field as a magnet can repel another magnet  Of course
this force only works in one direction and the magnetic field generated has
to be unimaginably powerful  Magnetic repulsion drops off as r and the
earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak  It would require
some sort of unknown superconductor and special nonmagnetic construction
And seriously hardenned electronics optical computers perhaps  And the
physiological danger would be significant due to the iron content in our
blood among other things  In other words forget it

Can the idea of a dragless satellite be used in part to create the electrical
field

After all the dragless satellite is I might be wrong a suspended between to
pilons the the pilons compensate for drag I think I know what I want to say
just not sure how to say it

A dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator

I missed out on the dragless satellite thread but it sounds totally bogus

I don't know what you mean by 'edged' but surely there are two other

 Getting wierd again
 
 Okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts Kind of liek the old
 MIRV principle of old Cold War Days 
 Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
 different missionsnamely different planets Each probe would be tied in with
 the mother ship or earth as the case may be This is good when and if we go
 for Mars the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the
 probes

I can't see the need for a single big expensive heavy mothership except
for Voyager style flyby missions A few years ago I did some calculations on a
Grand Tour space probe launched by a Saturn V in  At the timeI felt 
that
the idea of a big mother ship had some merit  the Voyagers had to be rather
small lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan
IIICentaur launchers The concept I examined and Michael's had a lot in
common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a
probe to Barnard's Star  ie a large bus spacecraft carrying several
smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination
The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a ton payload towards
Jupiter and beyond The bus could have included far more powerful
camerastelescopesscientific equipment and a heaviermore powerful power
source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore
Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements
within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter and usually at a
relatively great distance

The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the real Voyagers
and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in
the early st century and would have been released at various points during
the mission The advantages are obvious the bus would have carried out the
same basic JupiterSaturnUranusNeptune mission than Voyager  did but in
addition two subprobes could have been relased at Saturn examining
that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto This would have
enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of PlutoCharon by and several
other probes could have examined parts of the JupiterSaturnUranusNeptune
systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to
trajectoryrelated factors A small swarm of cameraequipped miniature space
probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a 
small Voyagertype mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy 
wellequipped spacecraft And would we have learned a lot more about the outer
planets The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money of
course

I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans
I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
of physical aspects of the planet  The question is what physical aspects
simply disallow earth like conditions

    Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled
 Habitable Planets for Man I think in   It should be available
 in most good libraries or through interlibrary loan

Why can't an aircraft be designed so that the pilot can always be 
maintained in a upright position perpendicular to the plane of
acceleration  With the visual helmets now being used that display
some of the flight parameters and with a keyboard and manuvering
equipment moving with the pilot a pilot may be able to function at
accelerations in excess of G  Is anyone currently pursuing this
area or is there a reason why this is impossible at the present time

Okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to Pluto is to large 
and to expensive

I'd hardly call the current Pluto Fast Flyby proposal too large if the
new technology insertion currently taking place succeeds the SC mass will
drop to  kg or too expensive  million FY  for two SC
especially when compared to other NASA planetary missions

Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
different missionsnamely different planets Each probe would be tied in with
the mother ship or earth as the case may be This is good when and if we go
for Mars the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for 
the probes

This proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and
the require minimal deltav from the mother ship  A mission to the main belt
might be one possibility for such a mission  I recall a paper being presented
at an AIAA deisgn conference in Irvine in February where such a proposed
spacecraft was designed by some grad students at UT Austin I think  Four
minispacecraft would detatch from the main SC each visiting a seperate
asteroid and then returning to the main SC  After analysis the main SC
would then be targeted for the most interesting object for further study

Now if I could only find that paper

It's vandalism because many people  power companies  do maliciously waste light 

maliciously implies evil intent  The lighting companies aren't going out
of their way to spoil the sky  They just don't care

If they can sell you
or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes  to  percent
of its light they make more money  Never mind that your money is wasted

It is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware
If that's what your city will buy that's what the lighting company will sell
Write a letter to city hall

That's fine idea but it only works if the lightingpower company even bothers to supply good light fixtures  For instance a power company in Virginia 
recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
type  Yet all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell
were bad designs  one that wasted the light  Thus you couldn't even buy
a good light from them  In most places to get a good light you have to
either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona  At some
point society starts to make rules  Cars have to pass safety tests  
Companies have to meet pollution standards etc  There are two ways to achieve this  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
down the lighting companies backs  History seems to suggest that the latter
is more likely to work


Please note that I'm not defending light pollution  The orignial focus of 
this thread was space based light sources

Agreed so I won't respond again  It's important for all you spacers out 
there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that 
have been presented  Just like Congress it would be best to consult
the astronomerslovers of the night sky before you try some PR stunt
to boost public knowledge about space

It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control

from DoD projects and their contractors  The construction industry


Of course

	How many government projects after Using PERT GANT CPMs
Process flow diagrams  Level  software projects  actually
come in on schedule and under Cost  I know the GAO determined
that  of all NASA projects  miss their budgets due to failing
to adequately measure  engineering developement costs   

Me I am allin favor of Government RD  I thought Bell Labs was one of the best 
to do research   I don't think the government should pour money
into any one sector  but should engage in projects which naturally
push the state of the art  

THings like  High tech  construction projects  apollo  was worth it for the doing  Running hte national labs  The SSC is grossly overweight  but
is a reasonable project at a lower cost  

Unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected

Maybe what they should do is throw out much of the process and just tell
new PH'ds  you get a  time grant of    If you produce you
can  qualify for other grants  If you don't  you never get in again

THis way  young people get a shot at  reserach  and older  stale

 Also as implied by other posters why 
do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway 
You don't need to but it's desirable  HST like all satellites in
low Earth orbit is gradually losing altitude due to air drag  It was
deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach for that reason
It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter  It has
no propulsion system of its own

Has any thought been given as to how they are going to boost the HST yet
Give it a push  I can see the push start cartoons now

 Option A  Modular Buildup  Pete Priest presented the A option Priest


I don't think this will work  Still the same in space
integration problems  small modules especially the Bus modules
the MOL would be bigger   

Also  budget problems  may end up stalling developemnt  
A small undersized station wont have the science community support

 Option B  Freedom Derived  Mike Griffin presented the status of Option


Program effeciencies may cut costs  but the basic problems
with freedom remain  in space integration  too many flights
too build  not enough science retrurn  

 Option C  Singe Launch Core Station  Chet Vaughn presented Option C
the Single Launch Core Station concept  A Shuttle external tank and solid


Essentialy   billion to build MIR

I think had NASA  locked onto this design back in   with
scarring to support a TRUSS for real expandability  we'd be looking
at a flying space station

This looks the most realistic to me  IMHO  but  i dont know if
there is enough will power  to toss the CDR'd  existing hardware
and then  take a rd  power cut  and do it this way

the core  launch station has a lot of positive ideas  You could stick

My data shows that the OMS engines hold  kg of propellant  Of that a 
substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn the reentry

going to take and how much the EDO pallet BUS and extra parts are going
mass  If you can make the numbers work out then I'll be interested  After
you show us that it can be done then tell us how much the EDO pallet BUS
and extra equipment is going to cost  


I don't know  Does anyone in NASA land know how much fuel is
budgeted for the altitude change

Henry  any figures on the mass  full  for the EDO pallet  plus
it's dry weight  How about for the dry mass of Bus  it was
being declassified as i checked last

Also I need

  current orbital parameters of HST 

  projected  orbital parameters after reboost

  Discovery's  DRY weight

 HST's Dry weight


I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in   months

First while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning that was
because they had to  They don't like to do that as a general rule


So how long do they need to train  a year   years  somehow
I think  moths should be adequate

Second remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat   They were trying
to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do that  
Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely


Also because they significantly lacked onorbit EVA experience  
The HST is designed for onorbit servicing  it should be a lot easier

Third they don't have eight months  They have however much time is left 
after someone comes up with a plan shows it can work and gets it approved
You may think I have a pessimistic attitude  I think it's realistic  I'm not
saying that the engineering task is impossible few engineering tasks are  
What I'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA
management


There comes a time in every project to kill the management

They can if neccessary reschedule the  HST mission  December is
not a drop dead date unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission  



All they have to do is soup it up  Just what does that mean  


I suspect the BUS may not have enough basic thrust for the HST
reboost  it mayu need bigger tanks  or bigger thrusters


My understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not
a contingency  My understanding is the mission  needs both
a new FOC  and work on the electrical system  plus
another reboost   


If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's  million
saved

No Pat  That's  million minus the cost of the new hardware minus the cost
of the extra struff you want to bring along minus development and mangement 
costs minus extra operating costs  TANSTAAFL


Somehow i think the cost of an expendable SMT will be less then
 million

and the extra stuff is real cheap  NASA has lots of suits  MMU's
and the EDO pallets are reusable  Oh one double magnum of champagne
now there's a couple hundred bucks





Pat not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's made to 
perform this task it also ignores the point  There is a desire to have 
astronauts available so that if the door fails to open something can be done
about it  Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door
you haven't solved the problem


That door has cycled X times already  Once after massive G loading
I somehow think they can work oureliability  methods to ensure the
door works

Also  please tell me how some sort of sublimated  material  like
CO or HO  would manage to contaminate the mirror  anything
that goes to vapor state shouldn't adhere to the mirror

somehow the door  problem can be worked  maybe they can put a one
time spring on it

what do they do now if the door hangs up  that door is part
of a intrument safing mechanism  if it hangs up tomorrow  it'll
be  months until someone gets up there witha crowbar to fix it

People who criticize big Government and its projects rarely seem to
have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and
technology  Basically the US Government has gotten into the role of
supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too
longterm  

Historically this role for the US Gov't was forced upon it because
of socialism in other countries  In order for US  industries to
compete with governmentsubsidized foreign competitors the US Gov't
has taken on the role of subisizing bigticket or longlead RD

This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into
the support of science some of it is relevant in technology  There
was little involvement of federal funds or except through support of
state universities of state funds for scientific research before WWII
The US research position had been growing steadily and the funding was
mainly from university and private foundation funds  There were not that
many research universities but they all provided their researchers with
low teaching loads laboratories assistants and equipment and funds for
travel to scientific meetings  Not that much but it was provided and a
university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well
as salary

During WWII the military and the defense departments found that pure
scientists could do quite well with their problems even though they 
were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise  This is
probably because of the research mind approach which is not to try
to find a solution but to understand the problem and see if a solution
emerges  This works in stages and as research scientists were used to
discussion about their problems the job got done

The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the
future and started funding pure research after WWII  But Congress was
unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the
future supply of scientists and set up other organizations such as 
NSF to do the job  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly
keep politics out  Also the government did a job on private foundations
making it more difficult for them to act to support research

The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which
the government supports research the university will not provide funding
and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money  Suppose
as has been the case I have a project which could use the assistance of
a graduate student for a few months  What do you think happens if I ask
for one  The answer I will get is Get the money from NSF  Now the
money at the university level is a few thousand but at the NSF level it
comes to about  thousand and is likely to keep a faculty member from
getting supported  So the government is in effect deciding which projects
get supported and how much  

Also the government decided that the wealth should be spread  So instead
of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research
institutions the idea that more schools should get into the act came into
being  And instead of evaluating scholars they had to go to evaluating
reseach proposals  As a researcher I can tell you that any research proposal
has to be mainly wishful thinking or as now happens the investigator conceals
already done work to release it as the results of the research  What I am
proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted I may find 
impossible or I may find that it is too difficult  In addition tomorrow
I may get unexpected research results  Possibly I may bet a bright idea
which solves yesterday's too difficult problem or a whole new approach to
something I had not considered can develop  This is the nature of the beast 
and except for really vague statements if something can be predicted it
is not major research but development or routine activity not requiring 
more than minimal attention of a good researcher  

I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would
have happened if the government had never gotten into it and the government
is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders

How different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug
be from that of the Shuttle and it's OMS engines
 
 The aperture door will be shut during reboost Using the shuttle
 means that there will be someone nearby to pry the door open again 
 if it should stick
 

Well no during the original deployment mission the HST aperture door was
not opened until after the Shuttle had landed  

I presume that during a reboost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter
with the orbiter bay doors shut but still there would be lots of contamination
worries  I understand that the EVA suits are one of the hardest things to 
keep clean

But I still don't know where the idea is coming from that HST NEEDS a
reboost  We have many problems but our orbit is the least of them  There
is certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in
December

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost
and you don't want to clip off the panels each time

The artist renderings that I've seen of the HST reboost still have
the arrays fully extended with a cradle holding HST at a  degree
angle to the Shuttle  I think the rendering was conceived before the
array replacemnet was approved so I'm not sure if the current reboost
will occur with the arrays deployed or not  However it doesn't 
appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost
 
For the GammaRay Observatory one of the design requirements was that
there be no storedenergy mecahnisms springs explosive squibs gas shocks
etc used for deployment  This was partially so that everything could
be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay and partially for
safety considerations  I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile
would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened
 

Thanks for the input on GRO's SA design constraints  That would 
explain the similar design on UARS

Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to
orbit of  per pound  everybody designed things for easy servicing
 

Heck the MMS project used to design missions with servicing in mind
The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an onorbit replacement
for the instrument module on EUVE  That way you get two instruments
for the price of one spacecraft bus the Explorer Platform  A 
second onorbit replacement was also considered with the FUSE telescope

 No  A dragless satellite does not magically have no drag it burns fuel

     Well almost It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can 
engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order 
harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a 
satellite and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of 
months to years 

     My favorite example of this is the SovietRussian heavy ELINT 
satellites of the Cosmos  class which are in  resonance In 
particular C has undergone two periods of prolonged gain in 
altitude the current one having started in June  the mean altitude 
of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on  
March  Looking at the elements for C also shows the 
limitations of NORAD's software  but that's another story 

    This probably has little relevance to space stations since the  
degree orbits of the C satellites are at  km which is 
unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms But 
it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the 
situation 

    Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request

That's fine idea but it only works if the lightingpower company even bothers to supply good light fixtures  For instance a power company in Virginia 
recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
type  Yet all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell

Uh why do they have to ask a state commision Unless the state's buying

Such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company
of selling different types of light and will decreace the likleihood
that they will do so And any efficient lights they might have been
planning in the future go down the drain

were bad designs  one that wasted the light  Thus you couldn't even buy
a good light from them  In most places to get a good light you have to
either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona

You could order it special If enough people did so it would be 
low cost Last I checked you could use UPS to buy stuff in Arizona
before going there

Finally I'm sure your state has things like small factories and
machine shops You could go into business making lights that are
cheaper to use thanks to their higher efficiency and the
fact that they aren't wasting energy on broadcasting to space
and therefore better than the old style

  At some
point society starts to make rules  Cars have to pass safety tests

Five year plans have to be enacted or the planning for the economy
will fall apart
  
Companies have to meet pollution standards etc

As if the clean air act really cleaned up the air

  There are two ways to achieve this  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
down the lighting companies backs  History seems to suggest that the latter
is more likely to work

MY experience seems to suggest that you're trying too hard
to educate them with the same methods used in American schools
to make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as ProtoUgric
instead of selling them on the idea


Agreed so I won't respond again  It's important for all you spacers out 
there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that 
have been presented  Just like Congress it would be best to consult
the astronomerslovers of the night sky before you try some PR stunt
to boost public knowledge about space

Well wake up Space is becoming a field of human endeavor
instead of just something we can look at from a long long
way away There are practical space projects that could conceivably
although probably not cause lots of light pollution and 
have been argued against on those grounds even though they
might open up such possibilities that people could vacation on
Mars if they wanted really dark skies

Rockwell International in Downey California in conjunction with the
other shuttle contractors delivered the world's most important and
most revolutionary space vehicle

Ha

One cannot argue with the fact that
it flies lands and is reusable 

Watch me It flies It lands It gets rebuilt


In my opinion these were the only
appropriate specifications for this program

That's not what they told us back in the ''s

It has been a test program from the start a logical follow to the
X program and the later Xseries lifting bodies

 It isn't a logical followon A logical followon would have
been either a Russian snowfox type thingey for the lifting bodies
or something like MMI's Space Van or Boeing's TSTO or the airbreathing
TSTO the military is allegedly using now that probably cost less
to develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year

The engineering specs that the guys in the trenches had were to
develop a system which was manratable could land reliably and could
be reflown  These goals were quite visionary for the 's and I
would argue that they are challenging even today including for the
DCX program

Keep that attitude and it'll be a couple centuries before we get real
access to space unless another country without all that baggage comes
along and kicks our ass in the space race

I do not recall a  flightweek specification in the final NASA specs for the
space shuttle program  If you have such documents I would find them most
revealing and interesting  As far as I can tell the only people touting a 
 flight per week flight rate were people on Capitol Hill or selling books 
to the general public  

Or NASA HQ That doesn't give the rest of the program plausible deniability
if we deceide that it wasn't worth the money we've spent which is by now
probably a lot more than Apollo

IMHO political statements in the halls of the US Congress are not
admissable as engineering specs because specs should be determined by
NASADOD and contractors not by Congressmen Senators or Presidents
Missions are defined by political leaders but not the engineering
specs

Yes but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements
You're saying basically that it met the engineering specs which is
questionable IMHO so it's a success never mind that you couldn't
get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in
a thousand years

The shuttle is the only reusable space vehicle  This automatically
qualifies it as an unparalleled engineering success  You could argue
about its political success  But engineering wise it is clearly the
most advanced machine ever flown  I argue that engineering and
technical data for hypersonic flight is valuable in and of itself
Shuttle should be justified or criticized on the basis of economics

You can get hypersonic flight data with an X or a followon X
type vehicle for much less

And economics and engineering are interchangable engineering in the
absense of economics is basically just physics and in terms of physics
the shuttle looks like a failure next to the X


Then Henry wrote

HSSorry support that I can arrange for launchers all goes to launchers
HSthat I have some hope of riding some day  At the moment that's
HSDCX's hopedfor successors

I was disappointed by this and other similar statements from those vocal in 
support of the DCX program   Your support of DCX is based on hopes
My support for the shuttle program is based on record 

The shuttle program has a bad record I once had hopes for the
shuttle program By now I know those hopes were false 

All I have for DCX and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicles
are hopes But at least I know they aren't false hopes yet

I did support the shuttle way back when It didn't do nearly what
it was supposed to It's time to move on to something that might do
the job of orbital delivery better Or at all


I think that it is 
also important to note that I do not object to DCX  It is visionary  
I originally posted

 I like the DCX idea  and I am really hopeful that it'll be a stunning success 

Unfortunately DCX'ers are not willing to return that support the
proven Shuttle program  Explain why you folks criticize shuttle when
shuttle is exactly what you guys need in order to learn how to operate
DCX onorbit

We don't want to learn how to operate on orbit It launches it
shoves out the payload it lands It doesn't waste payload hauling
up and down EDO pallets and the like

The only thing to be learned from shuttle is how not to build a
launcher

Finally that bit about the proven shuttle Are you hoping you can
tell a lie enough times and get someone to believe it

I enjoyed your later postings regarding the comparisons between the shuttle
and the Soyuz project  Although I may disagree with your method
of analysis  You probably will disagree with mine   I think that
the total impact of the shuttle program must be judged on the scientific and
technical merit not on timelines and schedules do you agree 

How much science and technology could have been done is the money spent
on shuttle had been spent differently


As for now we need to stop thinking of DCX and shuttle as mutually exclusive

Learn about economics and the current budget realities in the United States
please

Thanks for your time

Ken

Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big
Boys if you're tackling Henry  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in
on the subject of staggering operational costs too  Good luck son

In article spbeohscuscedu khayashhscuscedu Ken Hayashida writes
Shuttle is the only method in the free world of orbiting large life sciences
and medical related packages  

Ahem  The Russians are in the Free World now or at least it would be
Politically Correct to contend so

I am hopeful that DCX  or whatever the followon is eventually called 
will perform as you state  But right now I must admit that I am more 
skeptical than ever  

It will be tough to make DCX succeed and to turn it into an
operational orbital vehicle  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of
the promised goals  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's
the only chance we have now or will have for a long time to come
to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs  

There is no Shuttle successor in funded development NASP is dwindling
away and ALSNLSSpacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any
zeroes off that  per pound cost   Part of the blame for
this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual
billions of the er Free World's available space cash  As you will
no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come 

DCX is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping
development costs low and flying incremental Xplane hardware
It's been to my mind incredibly successful already they've built a
complex prototype in under  days for under  megabucks  I would
have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in s
America never mind flying the thing getting a successor funded or
building the DCY

I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any
expansion of astronautics  I don't see a realistic  prospect for
beating down those costs for multiton payloads anywhere else  If
the DC flops it'll be business as usual in space  The Nineties and
the DoubleOughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties a
prospect too depressing to bear

Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different
direction  It doesn't lower costperpound but it offers an orbital
launch for under ten megabucks  It's creating its own market for
small payloads

I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs There are
plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems some
of them as good as or better than SSTO  There is no sign in today's
world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an
assembly line

You could change my view on DCX if you could prove the following
deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight
  that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a manratable
DCX successor

Strawman  Is anybody seriously proposing this  References please 
The DC must be developed in the realworld funding climate which
includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle
operations as well as the bird in the hand argument your common
sense tells you   If DCY flies at all it flies alongside the
Shuttle not instead of it

Also of course DCY and its operational descendants will be useful
for a wide variety of jobs even if they are not manrated

  Most importantly that the DCX will open up LEO to more scientific and
technical payloads

If a DCX successor can fly a kg payload for M or even M
rather than the M it now costs more people will be able to afford
more payloads for the same money you can fly several satellites
instead of one  Big outfits can fly multisatellite series  Little
outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own instead of
begging a ride  This is just supply and demand  You should be able
to convince yourself that point  will be true assuming DC makes a
big difference in costs  Do you have some reason to think not

Well Spenzwhat can I say 
You've attacked my beloved vehicle 

If I may offer a constructive criticism perhaps you should decide if you
love vehicles or the use they are put to I myself think the F is
a beautiful aircraft but rest assured I wouldn't even think of flying
it in combat today Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles
on how they perform

We see zerodefects operation in many areas of life  

Not to this degree

Calling shuttle flight characteristics bizarre in the same post 
as touting DCX is interesting  

Why

DCX will also have similar zerodefects issues am I wrong  

Your wrong The DC approach is very tollerent of failure It also has
the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature Shuttle
isn't reusable it's salvagable

I am thinking of how DCX will deploy a chute or reverse orientation at 
supersonic speeds  

The flip over happens at a very low speed not supersonic If the DCX
shows the flip over works it will work unless the laws of physics change

How much in DCX is redundant  That's the real question

The final DC will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight
envelop Upon reentry for example it can loose about  of available
thrust and still land safely

Everything we do in life has zerodefects issues at times agree

Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same
thing Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design SSTO is

As a doctor I can not error in my diagnosis and treatment recommendations  

You don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out You
wouldn't for example give a patient a drug and not monitor them for
harmful side effects would you

While DCX's RD program makes good sense I am less optimistic about DCX 
as you and apparently others are  

You are very much in the minority If the DC series fails to make orbit it
will still be a very worthwhile effort It will show us EXACTLY what we do
need to do to build SSTO

But DCX will still have failures  It is the nature of aerospace RD  

Again refering to the DC it will provide fully intact abort theroughout
the flight envelop Shuttle doesn't DC is fault tollerent Shuttle isn't

It's successors are not slated to be passenger carrying  

Not true Build a passenger pallet a fairly easy thing to do and it will
carry passengers

The impression I had
when I visited MacDac Huntington Beach's Open House was that the payload space
was limited and the manratable version was decades away

I would suggest you talk to the DCX crew themselves Their original
schedule had an operational DC flying in 

Shuttle is the only method in the free world of orbiting large life sciences
and medical related packages  As for now it is our only ticket into space 
and has my support

Your ignoring the dammage it does Mannes space has a reputation for being
unreliable and hugely expensive Shuttle supporters only make it easy for
opponents of manned space to kill it

You could change my view on DCX if you could prove the following

The only way to prove those things is to build it

As a rough guess I would say that in  years Shuttle has delivered
to LEO about as much as Saturn V did in  years

We have to be careful to define what is payload and what is propulsion
and spacecraft structure 

Often Shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages Yet we still consider it
payload Ten Saturn flights over about  years delivered to LEO roughly the
same as  shuttle flights over  years

of course Saturn lifted more than Shuttle
but it's cost to orbit in same year dollars was higher

They where pretty much the same in terms of costpound A resurected
Saturn would cost only  per pound if development costs are ignored
which is five times cheaper than Shuttle

 Some new information has been discovered recently Microscopic fossils
 have been found in VERY old rocks The theory is that this life is so
 old that it must have been destroyed during the periodic intense 
 meteorite bombardments that were a feature of the early solar system
 Under this theory life originated on Earth multiple times between
 multiple meteorite bombardments and therefore the conditions for
 the creation of life cannot be that unlikely


This was all badly reported in the news  There is no evidence that
signs of life found in old rock predate putative planetsterilizing
events  Rather the argument was that if life arose shortly the last
sterilizing event then it must be easily formed  The inference
was that life originated before and was destroyed but there was
no evidence of that

However even this argument is flawed  It could well be that origin of
life requires specific conditions say a certain composition of the
atmosphere that do not last for long  So perhaps life formed
early only because it would have had no other chance to do so
not because it was likely that life would originate under those
conditions

The most revealing comparison between Shuttle and Soyuz is cost All
other comparisons are apples and oranges

 Maximus wb

I like this statement though for my own reasons  Cost comparisons depend
a lot on whether the two options are similar and then it becomes very
revealing to consider what their differences are  Can Soyuz launch the
Long Exposure Facility  Course not  Will the Shuttle take my television 
relay to LEO by year's end  Almost certainly not but the Russians are
pretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule

Comparing S and SS points up that there are TWO active space
launcherandworkplatform resources with similarities and differences
Where they are in direct competition we may get to see some market
economics come into play

	What evidence is there that there is a trend towards greater
species diversity over time What I see going on right now is a major
extinction event and  it isn't clear to me that the diversity K years
ago was necessarily greater than  million years ago

Well there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of
The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase
in animal diversity Likewise after the onetwo punch of the
Permian and Triassic extinctions the number of marine animals
rose steadily  to an alltime high  just prior to the spread 
of humans

 biggest exception being the KT bye bye dinos extinction

 about  families

Also plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in
succesive sweeps Mosses colonized very wet environments first
ferns who had evolved vascular tissues took over more territory
when they evolved  These were eventually mostly replaced by gymnosperms
pines and the like  and then mostly displaced by angiosperms flowering
plants  now the dominant plant group on the planet Fungi
also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land 

 around the carboniferous up to about  families
 around the triassic up to maybe  families
 starting in the cretaceous rising to about  families currently

It's unclear to me at least what the max equilibrium number
of species the earth can hold  and if it has ever hit this
in the past It could be warning speculation alert that
diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions
happen often enough to keep the total number down

 This would depend a great deal on how fragmented
specific ecosystems were 

See Cowen's book History of Life for a nottootechnical
rundown on well like the title sez the history of life
Or see Wilson's Diversity of Life for a view centered more
on current ecology  this is IMHO the best popular biology
book of what the hell I'll say it all time

Pennicillin if i have everything correct  was a highly valuable
Mycotoxin  discovered during WW  It proved to have an amazing
Bacteriocidal effect without human toxicity   It's immediate
administration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving
problems  that previously were fatal  Although initially
enormously expensive to culture  within  years
the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude
and within  years  was  not much more expensive then
aspirin  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide
class of infections

Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval  It promised
amazing results for Toxic shock a rapidly fatal disease
It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and
developement  However it works  less then  in  times
of administration  and costs  per administration
with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost
The drug thus costs  per useful case  and is
implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some
patients

I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin
but to centoxin

It is interesting to note in the past few days' correspondance that some
believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial
space launch business  For many reasons it can and we here on the front
lines see no reason why it should not  The 'spaceport political publicity'
referred to the other day had its intended effect  the state of New Mexico
did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a
commercial space port  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of
dualuse for the facilities  The WSMR location also has some strategic
advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space
to support the project  Just because the folks involved have not done the
traditional aerospaceequivalent of vaporware by inviting folks out to kick
nonexistent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for
launch don't think that nothing has happened  From my interactions with
the MACDAC folks I get the impression that they want to set a firm
believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction
to plug a space on a calendar  I believe that all will happen this summer
and don't worry the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it
does occur

In the New York Times on Sunday May th in the week in review
section there was a report of a group called Space Marketing
in Atlanta Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide
reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large
and as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising
There was an editorial about this in the Times the following
Tuesday

Are others as upset about this as I am  I feel that a global
boycott of anyone involved with such a project would be a good
idea  Perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries
around the world  Do others agree

I realy like this idea it would be wonderfull to see such a 
big bright satelite on the night sky I will even promise to
try to buy whatever product it advertises to help this project

Please write to Space Marketing and encourage this project
I sadly dosent have enough money to invest in it

In some sense I think that the folks who think the idea is wonderful and the
folks who want to boycott anyone who has anything to do with this project are
both right

That is I think that space advertising is an interesting idea and if someone
wants to try it out more power to them However a company may discover that
the cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising and a company who 
gauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising would
gain might decide to bow out of the project

I got incensed when I read that Carl Sagan called this idea an abomination 
I don't think that word means what he thinks it does Children starving in the
richest country in the world is an abomination an ad agency is at worst just
in poor taste

If this idea goes through it's the thin end of the wedge  Soon
companies will be doing larger and more permanant billboards in the
sky  I wouldn't want a world a few decades from now when the sky
looks like Las Vegas  That would really make me sad

Huh  Please state your criteria for selecting the greatest philosopher
title  PS Ever read any Nietzsche

Greatest  most likely to be remembered five hundred years hence
I must admit that that makes many of my personal favorites not 
that great  I make no comment on Nietzche except to remark that 
he was no Immanuel Kant  Interpret that cryptic remark as you 
please

Some people have appended that remark that Nietzche was no Kant
with thankfully I haven't read enough of either to comment although
everyone tells me I should read Nietzche

I would have to say that the greatest philosopher title would have to
go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially
defined by him  Although he got most of his answers wrong he did 
definitively identify what the important questions are  I think it
was Descartes who said that All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato

If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances
in human knowledge over his lifetime that's simpleit is Aristotle
This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as the philosopher

Regarding Nietzsche he's one of the most entertaining although since his
ideas were so fragmented and since his life was cut short it is doubtful
that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive  years
from now  They'll probably still be reading him in  years though

As for modern philosophers I would have to say that Kant was the most
influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who
came after him and unfortunately they maintained his errors and 
amplified them over time

I would say that the most influential american philosopher would have to
be Dewey

But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in
 years it may very well be Ayn Rand who in every important respect
was American but was born in Russia  But I guess that remains to be seen

garykezvuucp Gary Coffman writes
Lack of a skeleton means that muscles have to actively resist
gravity at all times on land rather than supplying only balancing
forces That means that much more energy would be required for the
creature to function The bones also supply leverage points for
pushing and lateral movement That's why you don't find large 
active boneless creatures on land

Hydraulics can make rigid tubes  No energy required just for
support  Hydraulics also allow a creature to produce large
forces with weak muscles using the principle of a hydraulic jack
rather than a lever

This is one of those yes but things It's true that a hydraulically
pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube
but even at  PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily
though it's straighton compressive strength is high and it's torsional 
resistance increase is practically nil On the other grasping member 
there's no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature Tree roots 
are an example Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure
increases

It's interesting to note that on
land creatures are either two legged or  legged with tiny insects
having  or  legs but never  legged though that would be a 
stable configuration It can be argued that  legged creatures 

Kangaroos are legged  The specific number of limbs a creature has is
an accident of evolution it is hard to make changes in some
structures  The panda has a thumb plus as many fingers as its
ancestors five on each hand but the thumb is a modified wristbone
rather than a modified finger and extra fingers are much more common
than extra limbs especially fullyfunctional ones

Kangaroos limbed I don't think so If you take the view that the
tail is a limb then monkeys and kangaroos are limbed I think the
tail is a different kind of structure grossly enlarged in the case
of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather
than locomotion I don't know much about panda thumbs so I'll ask
is it opposable

Thermodynamic considerations of surfacevolume relationships would
seem to dictate that active complex creatures  stay in a size range
similar to what we see about us  inch tall intelligent aliens
seem unlikely as do those much larger than the elephant

Why can't a lemur or a brontosaurus be intelligent

Yes I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by
putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus but so far
space aliens are also mythical

Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent but I'll
bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I
don't think it's likely First let me say that when I say intelligent
I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level
with or greater than human tool use and tool building IE assuming
suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter 
it's enviroment in a planned way it will do so That's certainly not
a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice
for a putative technological alien

Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought but
it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level
of complexity This is generally determined by the number of neuron
cells and their interconnections So a creature the size of a lemur
wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought This argument
is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur There's room
for a large brain though no indication that one ever developed One
reason this may be true is neuronic speed The electrochemical messages 
that trigger neurons require time to propagate This makes it difficult
for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very
large creatures So there's little selection pressure for such brains
Instead a simpler distributed network evolves This doesn't rule out
intelligent dinosaurs but it points in that direction

Then there are the thermodynamic arguments A tiny creature like the
lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly
lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio I contend that a creature
that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time
to develop and exercise intelligence That argument may be somewhat weak
The dinosaur's problem is the reverse it must moderate it's heat production 
because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat 
I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical
reactivity reasons for productive neuron function So creatures would
tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that
of humans if they are carbon based That tends to rule out cold blooded
creatures as potential homes of intelligence Some people contend that
some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded But for a creature
the size of a brontosaur it's activity levels would have to be restrained
or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the
waste heat Whales are similar size but they can reject heat to the
ocean a much more efficient sink than air I suspect that for intelligence
to manifest itself a certain degree of activity in interacting with the
environment is necessary IE monkey curiousity I doubt a large dinosaur
would be capable of that much activity

Hmmm  Not sure what's required for ships  Probably not much since
if a ship goes down it doesn't hurt too many people other than those

goes down it can make quite a nasty mess on the ground should it
land in an inappropriate place


Considering the magnitude of loss of life in both the Moro Castle

Besides if a LNG tanker breaks up in a close harbor you can kiss
off quite a lot of population  same thing for any chemical
tankers

I know the coast guard makes  mandatory safety equipment
checks on all watercraft  they use this as an excuse to
make narcotics  searches without warrants

I suspect that  commercial craft need a certificate at least similiar

groundbased visible light astronomy what these proposed
orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field The
opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or spacebased
telescopes In any case a bright point of light passing through
the field doesn't ruin observations If that were the case the
thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets
might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned
they are extremely bright

But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in
 years it may very well be Ayn Rand who in every important respect
was American but was born in Russia  But I guess that remains to be seen

 Please take this out of scispace

 Ayn Rand was not only born in Russia but educated there A lot
of her philosophy reflects not only a European education but a 
reaction against certian events in Russia while she lived there
I've heard that to the extent there is a division of modern philosophy
between the Continental and BritishAmerican schools Rand belongs in
the former in terms of methodology et al even though she was trying to
say things that would belong in the latter school

Ie she was trapped in the language of Kant and Hegel even though
she was trying to say at times much different things

having every part of your life saturated with commercials but many of
us loathe it

While I'm sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious that wouldn't be
because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer Modern 
groundbased visible light astronomy what these proposed
orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field The
opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or spacebased
telescopes In any case a bright point of light passing through
the field doesn't ruin observations If that were the case the
thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets
might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned
they are extremely bright

Tell that to the people who run the meter Keck telescope or the 
astronomers and engineers working on the Gemini twin meter telescope
project  It took  years to build Keck I and now they are building
Keck II  According to the December  Sky  Telescope This
second meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope
with double the lightgathering power and the ability to resolve
the headlights of a car some  kilometers away   Japan's meter
Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea  All these telescopes
will work in the infrared yes but they are visible light telescopes

And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics  A lot of research
was done with Star Wars funding and some is now being shared with
astronomers  This shows great promise  Soon probably within a few
years even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their 
theoretical limit despite the distortions of the atmosphere

To say that visible light astronomy is already a dying field is 
pure hokum  To use the logic that things are already bad so it doesn't
matter if it gets worse is absurd  Maybe common sense and logic
are the dying fields

Phil your point is well taken  It is still a sad idea

I'm worried by the concern about it though for a number of reasons
that have nothing to do with Space Advertising which for a number of
reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds

And I've been reading and and writing this thread since way
back when it was only on scispace

For starters I don't think the piece of lightpollution apparatus
would be as bright as the full moon That seems to me to be a bit
of propaganda on the part of opponents or wishful thinking on the
part of proponents

Second this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been
levelled against other projects that either  don't increace light
pollution significantly or  increace light pollution only over the
target area

You may or may not recognize  as being Solar Power Sattelites
I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math showing that
SPS's weren't that bright after all ending some two months of frenzied
opposition on the part of darksky activists and various other types

 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested
recently  While slightly more worrisome I'd like to point out that
any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of
these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be
concerned and something any project like that would work against
anyway And given some of the likely targets I don't think there's
going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants There is too much
dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter and I doubt you'll find
many activists in Murmansk demanding the natural sky back If anything
he'll probably be inside stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp
making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the day

The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass
advertising They think that if they can build one it'll be one of
those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't
have lived without before And I doubt anyone's going to really be
able to convince them to stop

In the New York Times on Sunday May th in the week in review
section there was a report of a group called Space Marketing
in Atlanta Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide
reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large
						      
and as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising
  

From the description I've read it's prob only going to be
as bright as Jupiter Anything else is probably hype from the
opponents or wishful thinking from the sponsors

If we could do something as bright as the full moon that soon
that cheap the CIS would have done it already

Not to flame REALLY but thats an abominable viewpoint while were
on the subject of abominations  If we followed the redistiribution
of wealth and by the way ist that what Clinto and the Democrats are
trying to do EVERYONE would starve in short order  Not only is
it impossoble to organize a fair distribution that depends on every
woman's altruism can you say black market under communisim
anyone but the current methods of resource production are entirely
energy dependant  There are not enough sources of cheap capital
aside from human capital to allow us to stop looking at space a an
excellent source of materials and realestate  More directly perhaps
you mioght consider the fact that BILLIONS are spent by TV companies
and their sponsors ABC NBC CBS on the SUPERBOWL the OLYMPICS
and even on monday night baseball games  Perhaps we should boycott
those games  If DCX and company get finished and there is a market
for it those abominable space will probably be much more cost
effective for the companies and those starving children  More people
buy products the company hires more workers end result fewer
children die of starvation

Ok so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy
computer algorythims but have you looked ad the Hubble results the
defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software see
those jupiter pictures for results but is the effects are completely
reversable why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it

The way I see it and please astromomers give me a swift netkick in
the butt if i'm out of the ball park the astromers are making the
best of limited possiblities there's only one hubble and the shuttle
makes another in the near future a nonthought  Perhaps those self
same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind
mounted on the reverse sides of the mirror's if that is what is used
and then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope

Ahh perhaps that's why we've astronomers have just built  meter
groundbased scopes and are studying designs for larger ones
Seriously though you're never going to get a meter scope into orbit
as cheaply as you can build one on the ground and with adaptive optics
and a good site the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit
anyway  Also scopes in low orbit like Hubble can only observe things
continuously for  minutes at a time which can be a serious
limitation

opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or spacebased
telescopes In any case a bright point of light passing through
the field doesn't ruin observations If that were the case the

I sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent
and as bright as the moon  Have you ever noticed how much brighter the
night sky is on a moonlit night


thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets
might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned
they are extremely bright

Existing satellites are points of light but an advertising sign that
appeared as a point would be useless so I rather think these will
appear larger than a 'typical' satellite  Also satellite tracks are
ruining lots of plates in the current Palomar Sky Survey

For some reasons we humans think that it is our place to control
everything  I doubt that space advertising is any worse than any other
kind advertising but it will be a lot harder to escape and is probably
the most blatant example yet of our disregard for the fact that we are 
not in fact creaters of the universe  Annoying little species aren't we

The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the
primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image
processing software that much faster When they use the same deconvolution 
software on the images from the fixed Hubble be ready for some 
incredible results  There is every reason to believe that the results will 
exceed the original specs by a fair margin  

Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software  It works 
realtime not after the fact as is the case with Hubble  You might be
interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market in
the form of the AO Adaptive Optics System  Starting on page  of the 
April  Sky  Telescope is a three page review of this new product
It lists for   The article states The AO Adaptive Optics System 
comes in a handy softplastic case that a threeyearold could carry 
around  Even though this device is really only good for the brightest
objects it could cope with image movements of up to  millimeter
in the telescope's focal plane  Now just imagine how well this infant 
technology will do in a few years especially in a dedicated system that 
has hundreds of thousands of dollars and many manhours invested in its
development

Ahh perhaps that's why we've astronomers have just built  meter

fc Exactly what fraction of current research is done on the big 
fc visable light telescopes From what I've seen  or less 
fc down from amlost   years ago That sounds like dying
fc to me

 That doesn't seem like a fair comparison  Infrared astronomy 
 didn't really get started until something like  yrs ago it
 didn't explode until IRAS in   Gammaray and I think 
 Xray observations didn't really get started until the 's
 I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in 
 general and I know that extreme UV short of  Angstroms
 observations until the EUVE launched last year had almost 
 no history except a few observations on Skylab in the 's

 Twentyfive years ago the vast majority of astronomers only 
 had access to optical or radio instruments  Now with far more
 instruments available growth in some of these new fields has
 resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of 
 total astronomical work


Seriously though you're never going to get a meter scope into orbit
as cheaply as you can build one on the ground and with adaptive optics
and a good site the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit
anyway

fc That would be true if adaptive optics worked well in the visable
fc But take a look at the papers on the subject They refer to anything
fc up to  microns as visable I don't know about you but most
fc people have trouble seeing beyond  microns or so There are
fc reasons to think adaptive optics will not work at shorter 
fc wavelengths without truely radical improvements in technology

 Hmm some of the folks in this department planning on using 
 adaptive optics at the  m at Palomar for nearinfrared 
 observations  and  microns might be surprised to hear this

 And isn't the NTT already pushing toward  arcsecond resolution 
 from a groundbased site remember  arcseconds was one of the 
 selling points of HST

Weve had the the Great Western the  dunno  and the Great Northern
postulated as Brunels masterpiece Keep boxing the compass chaps youll
get round to it eventually

The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship
with hybrid sail and steam propulsion The Great Eastern which broke
the 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise was a revolutionary leap
forward in ship design A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel with
primary steam propulsion it was at the time easily the biggest ocean
going vessel ever built Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo
and  or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale while drag rose
with the square so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles
without coaling

Unfortunately there was no real market for such a beast at the time
and it was eventually sold off at scrap values As another poster
said it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable
laying ship It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying
a transatlantic cable in one go with the endurance and capacity to
carry the huge reel all the way and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for
defective sections See Arthur C Clarkes book How the World was One
 I think thats right 

If thats how the Shuttle goes down in history as a technical triumph
and a financial disaster for the builder it would not be entirely
ignoble but I doubt if history will be so charitable  Its true the
Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do but are they
worth doing With low cost access to space you could have an
affordable space station for doing shuttlelike extended manned
missions As it is the shuttle is not so much a spacetruck as a
spaceRV  only not so cheap to run

If anybody has a strong claim to control of the  the night sky it is 
astronomers  Check out the common law  In the days when wild lands
weren't scarce pioneers laid claim to the land by putting it to
use eg clearing and growing a crop  Even trespassers can lay claim to 
the right of passage if if they've done it for long enough and the
owners have not complained or taken steps to stop them  Usage
begets property rights

Astronomers have been using the night sky for thousands of years 
they own it 
eg light polluters they will lose their commonlaw right of ownership

Another consequence of their ownership is that they are free to sell
it  Now astronomers need money for their work  If light
polluting billboards and mirrors go up they will need even
more money to buy extra image processing equipment filters
space telescopes etc to get around the problem

So as long as we can define who astronomers are eg do
they include amateur astronomers  Nature lovers
we can set up a system of voluntary consensus to solve this
dispute instead invoking bans regulations etc enforced
by bribed politicians at the point of a gun why do folks always
think of that sordid solution we ought to pass a law to
solve problems first instead of as a last resort when other
methods have failed

Stuff deleted
  This proposal certainly needs work but how about working on 
these kind of ideas first before writing there ought to be a law 
letters to our Congresscritters let's give noncoercive consensus via 
the free market a chance to solve this problem

Jim Hart
jhartagoraraincom

Would Mr Hart please explain how one could get every nation on
earth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the
night sky without coercion'   Remember that not every nation
follows the English common law   In most countries for most of
history it was probably true that the rulers owned' everything
not explicitly owned by individuals   Even in North America
where by the principle enunciated the aboriginal inhabitants should
have owned everything when new arrivals wanted to use land
and resources they just took it over  In case Mr Hart hasn't noticed
there is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what
Of course if some friendly super power were to give an international
astronomy organization some antisatelite missiles and also agree
to defend it if attacked such a proposal might work but it
would hardly be noncoercive

Some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first
to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space
and also to use governmental actions like taxing power for example
to discourage them   This of course would be too coercive for
Mr Hart

Hello netters

   I'm new to this board and I thought this might be the best place
for my post  I have a question regarding satellite technology seen
in the movie Patriot Games  In the movies the CIA utilizes its
orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa
The photos taken by the sats are stunning  I know that sats are
capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles  My
question is this  The camp in question was taken out by the
British SAS  And while the SAS was in action the CIA team was
watching in the warroom back in Langley VA  The action of the SAS
was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat  The action was at
night and the photography appeared to be an xray type  That is
one could see the action within the tentsstructures of the camp
Does such techology exist and what is it's nature  ie UV IR
xray etc

PS  Who wrote the book Patriot Games

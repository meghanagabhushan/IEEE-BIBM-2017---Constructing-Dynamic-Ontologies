In article davea daveaxetroncom David P Alverson writes
I believe Apple has a patent on the region features of QuickDraw  A mac
clone would have to implement regions  This is why Apple's comment was
that
they believe it is not possible to make a Mac clone without infringing
on their patents  They may have other patents like this

Apple has patented their implementation of regions which presumably
includes the internal data structure which has never been officially
documented by Apple  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region

I'm guessing that either NuTek reverseengineered Apple's internal data
structure for regions I dunno if this would hold up in court or they
came up with their own data structure  If it's the latter then they
won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions  Besides PICT files
there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk  QuickTime
movies perhaps  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and
transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone or vice versa it doesn't
matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure

I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware
and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port  What
other patents does Apple have on the Mac

My wife has one of these  I have not had much chance to fiddle with
it but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines she
complains that the print is too light for her taste  The difference
is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select  is
adjusted to the darkest possible level  I don't find it
objectionable and indeed rather like it but be warned that some
people don't care for it and it is considerably different 

I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over writeblack
vs writewhite engines when dealing with TeX drivers  Is something
like that going on here

I need a device either an ISA board or a subsystem which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC etc but I need it for RGB

Please email and or post any leads

 Another thing why a SCSI interface 

 By giving the MO a floppy interface it could reduce the price of it and
 make it easily installed in existing devices

easily installed in existing pc clone devices you mean
and thats not even really true cause neither the controller
nor the computers bios will know anything about them

and it probably wouldnt be in sony's or whoever best interest
to restrict themselves to customers using pc clones and apple s
and whatever other obsolete boxes might use the familiar old
floppy interface

 Could someone post a definitive answer about the VRAM configuration 
 for the
 Q and presumably the C and C as well  There seems to be a 
 lot of
 confusion about this issue  I'd like to know
 
        What kind of SIMMs are the VRAM SIMMs ie pin etc

There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs unlike DRAM SIMMs which 
come in many many sizes and pinouts although they do come with 
differing amounts of VRAM on them  The ones you need are KB SIMMs are 
organized as K x  and have two K x  VRAM chips on them  This is 
the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use

        How many VRAM SIMM slots are there

Two

        What rules if any must be followed in filling the slots eg in
                 pairs sizes must match etc

Both SIMM slots must be filled putting a SIMM in only one slot does 
nothing for you

        How fast must they be

 ns for the Q and C  ns for the C

        Is there any other relevant information

There are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible 
with the Quadra and Centris video hardware  Make sure that the source you 
get them from guarantees compatiblity  In general if it works in a Q
it will work in a Q

 Please don't reply unless you have the correct information  Many 
 thanks in
 advance for helping to eliminate some noise from this group

    the Sony CPD has better video circuitry than either of the

I'm assuming that the cabling tells the Mac at startup what kind of
monitor is connected  Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac
magazines for products I'm not sure if it's just a monitor just a
video card or a package of both that allow you to change resolutions
on the fly wo restarting the Mac

If you were to buy a  would it be possible to switch back and
forth between Apple x and Apple x without restarting the
Mac  Is this strictly a hardware startup function or can software
intervene or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable
setting and switch automatically

As I said I know a multisession CDROM is necessary if you do more photos
BUT what if it is just a writable CDROM drive and do a second session
do you need one for that too

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multisession capability to
read the second session  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever

Here is a simplified way of looking at it
The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks  The
second session has a newer directory structure but the first directory still
exists because you cannot change only add  So if you put that in a 'normal'
drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all
data  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last
directory written to the disc older systems look only for 'the' directory not
taking multiple directories into account

Approximately four months ago I purchased a Quantum LPS HD from La Cie for
 After two months the drive started having problems First there were
intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then Silverlining
 wouldn't even recognize the drive So I got an RMA from La Cie and
exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one

Well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems
Often when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark Sometimes if I
then insert the Silverlining  program I can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives At that point I can restart the
IIsi and boot from the HD I've called La Cie again and they've given me
another RMA Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see
the drive there's a definite hardware problem

Given that this is the second bad drive in four months I asked La Cie to send
me a new one but they said no Also within three weeks after I purchased
my original drive La Cie dropped the price on it by over 

I can accept that a drive or two may be bad And I know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs And
I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations Nevertheless taken together the convergence of these
factsevents have left a bad taste in my mouth I should have added above that
when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will sendI think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again
reinstall everything from floppiesthey said it would cost me  for data
recovery

It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still
covered under a day warranty should be new 

I feel a little helpless about all this I don't mean to necessarily flame La
Cietheir support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful
But c'mon Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way I sent
a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I
asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price I told them I would like to apply
the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product They didn't even 
have the courtesy to reply one way or the other

What's the moral of this story I'm not sure But I do know I won't buy any
other products from La Cie in the future

Bill Krauthammer
fehgumiamiirmiamiedu

PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service
has been I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like
that All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and
I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future

 there isn't any copyright equivalent of the res ipsa doctrine
 but there's something kind of similar  to show infringement one
 element you need to show is that the defendant copied from your work
 if you're lucky you'll have direct evidence of copying  the smoking
 gun  normally you do this through circumstantial evidence by showing
 evidence of access from which one might reasonably infer copying
 this evidence of access is considered along with the similarities
 between the two works in deciding whether you copied  however if
 the similarities are so strong as to be striking an inference of
 copying may be drawn even without any evidence that the defendant had
 access to your copyrighted work
 
 in that case the burden will be on the defendant to rebut the inference
 of copying  for example evidence that he'd been on a desert island for
 the last ten years and had no contact with civilization

Hi folks

	what exactly is the maximum memory I can put in
a Quadra  My manual says MB with  x MB SIMMs 
but MacWarehouse and the like advertise MB SIMMs to
give it a total of MB Who's wrong Has anybody got
MB


Thanks

I have MANY questions for all you experts out there pertaining to apple's
builtin video  

 Do all macs that have builtin video have the ability to use VGA monitors
 If soif not which macs have this capability
 Can they drive SVGA as well
 how big of a vga monitor can they drive
 how can you tell if an unlabeled monitor is VGA  By the pinouts
    if so what should it look like

Particularly i'm interested in knowing if the si or ci drive VGA as well
as the LC's capabilities in driving VGASVGA

Thanks

Well here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to
this newsgroup  The test was the following command

xyPlotPoints


I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on
various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and
workstations  The results are posted below

Funny how the IIsi running at  MHz is slower than other equivalent
machines lots slower in fact  Perhaps the version of Mathematica
makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated
Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it  Wow 

Basically though I wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data  It
seems that Mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables  I
was just curious how different machines would measure up  

Well if you have any questions or if I forgot something just drop me

there a small utility that switches the functionality of the capslock

more than capslock so it would be more convenient and comfortable

         I had asked everyone about problems installing a  meg

 you can't have simms of different speeds in one machine even
 if they are both fast enough  ie  My  ns  meg and ns 
 meg simms were incompatibable  Just thought people might
 want to know

There's absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time 
alone would cause an incompatibility  There would have to be another 
difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem  I've often used 
memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever  As long as it's
as fast or faster than the minimum requirement you should be fine

Just out of curiosity did you actually try this and see a problem or 
were you told it wouldn't work and so never tried it  Also out of 
curiosity do you know exactly who in Cupertino you dealer talked to as 
I'd like to find out what they're basing this recommendation on

Could someone please tell me what a 

LaserWriter IINTX upgrade kit is

Its a small box which has a bag inn it  seemingly
containing  chips look like ROMS and a IINTX manual
The installation instructions are most informative and say in full
This product must be installed by an Apple 

SO what does this do  At first I thought it might be a NT to NTX

actually a  kbps modem using standard compression v vbis

up at k but I have never seen faster than kbps

When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State I got a chance to run

System had a  RGB  Don't know what the caches were set to
Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris is quite a

The kit is for an already existing Laserwriter IINTX It is a ROM
upgrade that replaces the font rasterizer code with the more
efficient speedier code that first became available in Adobe Type
Manager 

That software came out after the original NTXes and the socalled
ATM rasterizer is now standard on Postscript printers

I have been playing with my Centris  for almost a week now  I must say
this machine is really fast  The hardware turnon feature is annoying but
I got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm

However I still have a few complaints
 when I restart the machine every time the screen image the desktop
  pattern jerks up and down for a few times
 the Quantum  drive is noisy

Overall I highly recommend it  it is fast affordable and looks great

Fact IfWhen Apple release system  or what ever is current at the time

Who is going to pay Apples Prices when they can get the same thing cheaper 
else where Heck we can get a Sun Workstation cheaper than a Quadra and 
infact we have a number of times it ALL comes down to 

  If Apple released this before windows  was released I'd be behind 
them
  they missed the boat  So why is Apple continued development  Will it
  support the P to its fullest capabilities  Run faster than Windows  
It
  must do something significantly better than Windows and OS to warrent

No the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less 
profit in Hardware So the Next Step no pun intendedwell sort of is 
to make the money in software look at Microsoft if you think it can't 
happen after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to ONE

As you also said Windows is a nightmare for programmers so will the

 My MacPlus is having problems which seem temperature related After using

 show the disk icon and then goes dark I consulted Larry Pina's Book and 
 could not find these symptoms Has anybody else seen such symptoms
 Suggestions

Shure it is temperature dependent but this does not clean all your
problems
Based on some exp I must say that the connections between the power supply
and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure Ram simms can be
badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the
last
phase lower Voltage

So you can do following if you are used to such technical terms
 Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray
 readjust the  Volt level of your powersupply
 use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowin through the floppy
   a fixed piece of paper can prevent this
if you don't know how to do it beg a friendly technician

 What is the difference
 I want a doublespin CDROM drive by May
 
 looking into NEC and Apple doublespins only
 what is the best

Nec Toshiba and Sony Apple nearly deliver the same speed
As apples prices are very low compared to there RAM SIMMS
You should buy what is inexpencive But think of Driver revisions
It is easier to get driver kits from Apple than from every other
manufacturer

My advisor has decided to get a mac for the lab now that we are funded again

The consensus in the lab was that all we really needed was an LCIII but 
he decided he wanted a centris   The lack of an fpu on that machine
and the price struck me as making it worth less than an LCIII so I have 
suggested we get a IIvx instead  It seems heavily expandable and for 

what do people with IIvx's think of them  They seem like good machines to
me and I like the Nubus slots in case we ultimately decide we want to do
work with video on it

The IIvxLCIII performance at a Centris  price The only reason
to get an IIvx is if you really need the fullsize Nubus slots Keep 
in mind that the  supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet
This lessens but doesn't eliminate the need for Nubus cards And unless
you're running FPUintensive software the  will blow the doors off the
LCIII and the IIvx The LCIII on the other hand is sufficient for most
people and has a great price

If you haven't guessed I find halving the bus clock the IIvx MHz uP vs
MHz bus a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again

Another thing why a SCSI interface  for MDs

By giving the MO a floppy interface it could reduce the price of it and
make it easily installed in existing devices

This question is to me like asking Why use SCSI at all

 Due to the rather primitive standard DMA solution which is used by almost all
  floppy interfaces of PCs the speed is limited to approx  Kbytess 
  I want a standard allowing higher performance

 With SCSI the OS can issue a request to the disk and then go ahead with other
  things Later when the controller has performed the search and physical read
  data can be transferred to main memory at RAM speeds Not very relevant with
  MSDOS but MSDOS is not made for the future

 I've got a SCSI interface I've got a  and a  floppy too and I am
  not going to throw them out With SCSI I may add for all practical purposes
  an unlimited number of disk units without sacrificing any of my old disks 

 For my PC I've got a  Mbyte SCSI disk adopted from a SUN machine and I
  can carry it over to a Mac a Sparcstation an Alpha machine whatever I like
  to if I decide to turn my back to the PC I do know that I cannot expect
  to move the data without reformatting

There are probably numerous other reasons for SCSI as well

After all it is a floppy replacement we are taking about Mb isnt all that
much so it isnt going to replace the need of a fast fixed disk

No not replace but supplement And contrary to a floppy a MD may be fast enough
to run programs or access data directly off the MD So we'll have much higher
expectationsdemands which is much better supported by SCSI than the old floppy
interface And the price of SCSI controllers is not that high any more  isn't it
something like a dozen large pizzas nowadays

Subject Adapter Cable for VGA Monitors

Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to
Apple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's
 and Duo  into a true VGA style output signal The NEC Adapter does
not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into
the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode

Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one madeup

The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter I'm assuming
that the PowerbooksDuos will work with the same adapter


Macintosh LC to VGA
 
The Macintosh LC can supply a  x  VGA timed signal for use with VGA
monitors by using an adapter cable  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to
 colors and with the optional K VRAM SIMM the VGA monitor is supported
to  colors
 
Note     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level
          inputs  However some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work
          with the Macintosh LC
 
To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor you need to make an adapter cable
from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor  Following is the
pinout description for the adapter cable
 
Macintosh LC        VGA
Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name
         
                          Red ground
                          Red video signal
                          Green video signal
                          Green ground
                          Blue video signal
                         Blue ground
                        HSYNC
                        VSYNC
                        HSYNC ground
                nc      SENSE  SENSE tied together
 
VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin  to pin  on the Macintosh LC
video connector  The Macintosh LC grounds pin  on its video connector which
results in pulling down pin  and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA
monitor

  I have a Radius Precision Color x video card for the Mac that fits in a 
NuBus slot  The card has  Mb of VRAM on it which means that bit color 
is possible on the card  The card supports just about any monitor scan
rate you can think of I used it at x x and x but it
can go higher  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a
software control panel

  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card which means all QuickDraw 
calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card freeing
up the mac processor for other tasks 

  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night
was  at Mac's Place  I will sell it for   shipping  It is just
over a year old and never been any problem  It comes with software and the
original manuals

I've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro  memory
upgrade

I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi
at Apple Customer Assistance  She tells me that those who
purchased the LaserWriter Pro  in a  megabyte dpi no
greyscale configuration should contact their original dealers
who are supposed provide the meg memory upgrade  For those
who don't know the extra meg will allow printing at dpi 
or greyscale at dpi

If the dealers have questions they should be directed to their
hardware support numbers andor Apple Customer Assistance 
  corporate number

Regards

Glenn

PS  personally I'm annoyed at our school bookstore  They
really have an obligation to provide this information to all
of the customers who purchased the  in the original 
configuration they have the recordsthat's why they ask for
things like a phone number  When I get my upgrade completed 
I'm going to write Apple and complain

Because SCSI works well with removable media and works well with large
capacity devices The floppy interface you suggest handles the former but
it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter you'd have to kludge
it Plus it's extremely low performance AND SCSI has gobs of room for
expansion compared with a floppy I can just see it let's stick a 
a  a tape drive and a MO drive all on the floppy interface The
possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous

	Well I just got my Centris  yesterday  It took just over two 
weeks from placing the order  The dealer Rutgers computer store 
appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order  I ordered
the one without ethernet but they substituted one with ethernet
He wanted to know if that would be alright with me  They must
be backlogged on Centri wout ethernet so they're just shipping them
with  

	Anyway I'm very happy with the  with a few exceptions  
Being nosy I decided to open it up before powering it on for the first
time  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected
must have come loose in shipping  No big deal but I would have been
pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up
	The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine  I've
heard apple will exchange it if you complain so I might try to get
it swapped
	I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft poweronoff  This
wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw  Also the location
of the resetinterupt buttons is awful  Having keyboard control for
these functions was much more convenient
	Oh and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on powerup
I've seen this mentioned by others so it must be afeature
	Anyway above all it's fast  A great machine at a great price

Mine lives near a cat true really and picks up her fur  From what
I can tell it looks like Apple welded it shut

    You must not have tried very hard I just opend mine in about 
seconds Take a look on the bottom it has a dial that turns to open
much like the older ADB mouses used to have It's a bit harder to turn
at first but it is quite simple to open

Also does anyone know about installing FPUs in a Mac LC III  I've heard some
people saying it has fried the motherboard of the LC III

    Well if you don't match up the pins correctly you will have some
problems A close look at the socket should give you an idea of the
proper orientation of the chip

 Does anyone have information on acheiving  x  resolution on a Q
 using interanl video Is this even possible 

It's most certainly possible

Is it possible to use this resolution on the Apple  monitor
If so I could probably rig a connector with the proper pins

    Nope The Apple  monitor does not support multiple resolutions
It is not a multisynching monitor

This is an aside to Brian Hughes's please let's lose the cute phony names
everybody posting about adding memory to a Quadra 

    What phony names My name is clearly visible in the headers and I
sing the post with my account name If you have a problem with that
then you will have to get over it I've used this account name for over
 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 
generally recognize Hades as my account name I have no intention of
changing the way I post

I installed a couple of MB SIMMs in my Quadra and was somewhat dismayed
by the general complexity of the operation compared to for example the
wonderfully designed LC III It irritates me when Apple refuses to tell how
to do it in the User's Manual so you have to guess at how to disassemble
the devise in question it's the same for adding memory to LaserWriter
Pro's

    It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool
around with it's hardware That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to
do I personally like the design of the Q and applaud Apple for
coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of
those drive bays I like it a lot better than the  design except
for those people who need Drive Arrays I do however agree with you
about the LW Pro design

The operation isn't very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were
offered but Apple leaves you working blind

    Again its's not Apple's place to make it easy for noncertified
service people to fool around with Apple hardware even if they did buy
it Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac just don't
get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no
longer valid

After the memory was installed I was distraught that the top of the SIMMs
came into contact with the plastic case frame Mine actually contacted the
framework with quite a lot of pressure  enough so that the assembly of
the board back to the proper position was rather difficult and required
some force I could have filed a little excess material off the top of the
SIMM boards but chose to let it stand as is I have not had problems with
RAM yet so I will consider the problem annoying but not catastrophic

    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed MB
SIMMs into an LC back before lowprofile MB SIMMs were readily
available The standard MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and
make it a bit difficult to close the LC but it did close and work just
fine One of the nice things about LogicBoards is that they are
generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure

Get your facts straight before you post something like this  The Duo
Dock does not have a CPU of its own  It is a docking station with 
ports connecting various components including the portable PowerBook
with its own CPU  I guess these rumored new Duo Docks have a builtin
CPU to perform functions of their own  Interesting  If they're not

to write 'b' with my right hand Is this a difference between Danish
and American typing or what

It must be I type it with my left hand  Personally I would have
a real problem with my keyboard opened up like that because I tend to

Whether the drive is hooked up to the computer or not the LPS
makes a disk seek noise every  seconds  This is consistent 
and will continue as lomg as the drive is powered up  Even if 
I disconnect the drive from the computer this drive activity
continues at  second intervals

Someone tried to tell me the drive was doing a Thermal Recalibration

Not knowing beans about the internal physical workings of the lastest
disk drive technology I guess I might believe anything

Whats the scoop on this standalone drive activity every  sec

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general Some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes Basically the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance since when the media heats up or cools down some
track drift is inevitable and the drive has to monitor it This
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities and
so was used primarily on very largecapacity mechanisms but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive's longterm reliability and MTBF ratings

I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing say audio or video to hard disk Some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes

Hope this helps

Well although this may be an uncommon occurrence or not I had a bad
experience with TechWorks  This past summer I upgraded increased the memory in
a powerbook and a ci   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM I was
told by the sales person that they would give me a  rebate if I would return
the original RAM which was also TechWorks RAM  I followed the instructions for
returning the old RAM expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks

Well months went by and no credit  After many calls almost none of which were
ever returned  arghhh I finally found someone who told me Why we never
received your old chips  I then explained I the procedure that I had
followed to return them to which the person replied You mean you sent them
US Mail which I had per the original sales person's instructions  I was
told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon come on and that
I should have sent the stuff via FedEx etc  I reasoned that I had done exactly
what I had been told to but they would not budge the people I spoke with were
absolutely no help  I sent letters copies of the original receipts attempted
to trace the package through the US mail made many more phone calls to
TechWorks all to no avail I wouldn't giveup because I was so disgusted
Salessupport people supervisors there was nothing I could do to pursuade them
to make it right

I finally in total disgust wrote a letter to my credit card company asking
them to investigate the problem   Three weeks later the credit miraculously
appeared on my statement  I have not in recent memory been so disgusted with
the service that I received from a company  In all fairness they had no way of
knowing that was not trying to rip them off but I went to such great lengths
to prove to them that this really happened  Oh well c'est la vie  I will never
buy another product from them again

There  had to get that off my chest

I've had the board for over a year and it does work with Diskdoubler
but not with Autodoubler due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies
the owners of the board's compression technology I'm writing this
from memory I've lost the reference Please correct me if I'm wrong

Using the board I've had problems with file icons being lost but it's
hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else however
if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board
the icon usually reappears Because of the above mentioned licensing
problem the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress
a boardcompressed file unless you have the board installed

Since Stac has its own product now it seems unlikely that the holes
in AutodoublerDiskdoubler related to the board will be fixed
Which is sad and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since
they're being so stinky But hey that's competition

Is that the lowend configuration  If it is it has the LC no FPU as  
opposed to all the other configurations with a RC has an FPU  Be sure  
you know what you are getting before you buy  The RC is around

I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA
monitor an IBM  sold w many PS's to be exact on the Mac LC III 
All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work
on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the
sony's or the NEC monitors  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very
attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors  Am I
confused or are these vendors just not up to speed  Has anyone used an
LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your
adapter please be specific w vendor and cat   I would prefer to get a
apple monitor for these LCIII's it's unseemly to see the finder inside an
IBM bezel but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can
afford and the more PS's we can get rid of

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo
properly

When I first got it the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected and I had to pull it the rest of the way Nowadays and I've
had the system for  months the Duo doesn't come out at all  despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself Is there a simple fix for this or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display no VRAM no floppy or
SCSI etc 

BTW it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock  it just doesn't
want to slide out any more

Is it possible to install a nd    MB HD in a Mac II with a

Can i us a  pin cable with  connectors for the internal motherboard
SCSIConnector and the  SCSIHD Connectors The first HD is'nt

Whats about the power supply Where can i connect a   AMPConnector
to supply my   HD

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any
macintosh if you can find the space to put it I have a IIsi that came
with a Quantum  meg drive When I ran into space problems I slapped in
another  meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf Here is what I did
 
First off I was concerned about space Since both drives are Quantum
quarter height drives I finally decided that the logical place for them
was stacked one upon the other Fine they fit snugly I have not had a
problem with heat yet and these drives have been running together for
over two months

The next problem was connecting the drive If you have a spare internal
hard disk power cable as I did then half of your troubles are over just
splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard
connector and two hard disk power connectors If you don't have a spare
cable you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found
in any good electronics store for about  I would suggest properly
solderingheatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of
shorts or bad connections

Next you need a ribbon cable connection Again I had a spare hard disk
ribbon cable and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what
I did was purchase a crimp on  pin cable connector that gave me another
male connector in the middle of my spare cable The part cost  again
and is easily attached with any good wood vice The theory behind using a
crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work my original cable is not

Having done all that I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for
power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this
day 

In a mac II everything should work the same Be careful with the ID's of
the drive and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are
intact I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it
seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain that the signal
should be terminated at all the ends

Let me know if you have any more questions

Is it possible to install a nd    MB HD in a Mac II with a

Can i us a  pin cable with  connectors for the internal motherboard
SCSIConnector and the  SCSIHD Connectors The first HD is'nt

the second will be
Whats about the power supply Where can i connect a   AMPConnector
to supply my   HD

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any
macintosh if you can find the space to put it I have a IIsi that came
with a Quantum  meg drive When I ran into space problems I slapped in
another  meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf Here is what I did
 
First off I was concerned about space Since both drives are Quantum
quarter height drives I finally decided that the logical place for them
was stacked one upon the other Fine they fit snugly I have not had a
problem with heat yet and these drives have been running together for
over two months

The next problem was connecting the drive If you have a spare internal
hard disk power cable as I did then half of your troubles are over just
splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard
connector and two hard disk power connectors If you don't have a spare
cable you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found
in any good electronics store for about  I would suggest properly
solderingheatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of
shorts or bad connections

Next you need a ribbon cable connection Again I had a spare hard disk
ribbon cable and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what
I did was purchase a crimp on  pin cable connector that gave me another
male connector in the middle of my spare cable The part cost  again
and is easily attached with any good wood vice The theory behind using a
crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work my original cable is not
damaged and I can go back to the original setup

Having done all that I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for
power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this

I recently aquired a Quantum Q harddisk It is a  meg 
mechanism It is SCSI I have a few questions and a few problems First
there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't
figure out what it is for The address is set by some jumpers on the
bottom so I don't think it is for that Any ideas

Second it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive There are
a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for

Third I have got the drive to format It took a while to get things to
work and most of it is fine for now The formating initialy was
troublesome but seems to be ok The main problem is if you do a reset on
the MacPlus the drive disappears If I shut the mac off and then back on
agian then the drive comes up fine Any ideas

Please reply to one of the email addresses below

The problem is that My Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner will not
connect to my PowerBook  The Cable on the Scanner will not fit into
the SCSI port on the PowerBook

I then got a cable assembled to adapt the original cable to fit the SCSI
port This however turned the computer into SCSI mode and treated it
as a hard disk

I have asked an engineer in London to assembled a new cable The idiot
out of sheer laziness has taken  weeks and has yet to solve the
problem 

I am aware that Caere Co in the US have a solution

Do you know of a cable that will solve this problem Please help me if
you know the solution I will be forever grateful to you

I am going to be getting a C soon but I dont want Apple
to come out with the Cyclones and the Tempest in a month

good deal with a supplier for a C  and I would like to jump on it
but again I don't want the price drop to smuther me  BTW the deal
I have is a C  with mouse for  does anyone know of a better
deal

I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the
price of the C is going to drop this year  This week's MacWeek
reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August  My guess
is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price
structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer

Your price looks pretty good at about  more then I payed for
mine last month  I would have rather waited for one of the new
machines this sommer like the Cyclone but the resale value of my
IIci would have not been squat by then  Thus financing forced me
to purchase now  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel
betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then  next
week heh

Bottome line  If the C does what you want buy it  If you wait
until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as
well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and
then the units which follow them  You may save some money but
you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the
computer  Face it Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous
state of flux  At least they aren't going to try raising them
again grin

Hi

   I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher because while my Mac has
two serial ports I have AppleTalk a modem a printer MIDI and a sound
digitizer     unfortunately

   Specifically I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher because it
seems to be fairly cheap  About  at MacZone

   Does anyone know anything about it  I've heard that with most of these
things you can still only use  serial ports at a time it just prevents you
from physically swapping cables  Although I've also heard that programs
that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they
want does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox

   Finally if the Axion stinks or if you're using something else that you
think is good I'd be interested in hearing about other products  I would
like to spend under  if possible

   Please reply through mail I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup
If there's interest I can post a summary of replies

Thanks a lot

You should be able to pick up an ADB cable at any computer wiring store
I'd give you the address of Alberta Computer cable in Calgary but a I'm

I have the a CDTechnology drive with the Toshiba mechanism and it is
supposedly the fast and best now  It has an access of ms and a data
transfer rate Kbsec  It is multisession photocd compatible  It is
available from educorp for  the CDTechnology one and comes with two
mail in coupons for two free CDs  I'm not sure if the cd's are good since
I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped
to my home address in california instead of here in maryland  The
CDtechnology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive
which supposedly gives it a longer life and keeps it cleaner with no fan to
attract dust  A Toshiba brand drive is also available but I think the
CDTechnology is better since you get the same mechanism and at a slightly
lower price with two free CDs

The Apple i Drive Sony Mechanism is around a ms access time I
think and a data transfer rate of Kbsec  I know it is the slowest of the
three mentioned here  It is not widely available except through the apple
catalog which is bad at a price of only   It is also multisession photo
cd compatible I think the external model comes with  free cds some of
which are pretty good

The NEC drive has been out the longest  it has an access time of ms and
a data transfer rate of Kbsec  it is available from many vendors around
 dollars including Educorp  It wasn't multisesssion photocd compatible
before but I hear that the current version that is shipping is  Owners of
the older drives can get an upgrade  It does not come with any free cd's
unless you buy it in a bundle

Of the three CDRom drives above i think the best choices would be the
Apple drive and the CDtechnologytoshiba drive  The apple drive for it's
compatibility with apple products and the cdtechnologytoshiba for it's
speed and performance 

BTW the models of the drives are

Apple AppleCD  or AppleCD i internal

CDTechnology  CDT the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure but it
is also something like with 

NEC  CDR


I'm very happy with my drive  And have had no compatibility problems
whatsoever  If I am wrong about any of the above do correct me but I am
pretty sure of myself even when I think I'm not

Also some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as
the president of CDTechnology which happens to be in southern california
my hometown  However I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy  Liu is
just a common chinese name especially in southern california with the

I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around  megabytes  sec
for very large data transfers  Around  MB

I have a Quadra  
I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at  MBs
         using blockmode transfers
I have a highspeed disk array no asynchronous PB calls that can
         achieve  MBs

Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card

It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer
then transfer all the data from the buffer to card   MBs then  MBs
result in an overall  MBs  Too slow

So I tried the following scheme For an nmegabyte transfer 

Step                                 Load the st MB from disk to buffer
Step  Asynch send st MB out card   Load the nd MB from disk to buffer
Step  Asynch send nd MB out card   Load the rd MB from disk to buffer
        
Step n Asynch send the n MB out card Load the nth MB from disk to buffer
Step n Send the nth MB out card

Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously
and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all  It is using the buffer tho'
each of the steps  through n take as long as if the two transfers were
executed one after another  So there is no improvement in the rate

Why

Is the mac RAM dualport  So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both
access data at the same time
Is the problem that the two devices card and disk driver both have to use
the same bus to mac RAM

Is there anything I can do

Well folks after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face

Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own

Here's why People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a  processor
in it Apple can't deliver that right now because the  saps too much
power radiates far too much heat and is too large for a notebook How
does one get around that without designing a new chipset Use existing
PowerBook technology to your best advantage The Duo Dock gives Apple a
unique ability to give users that  power in a SemiPortable fashion
By plunking the  into the Dock you've got quadra power at your desk
On the road that mhz  should be able to handle most of your needs
Okay not the BEST solution but its an answer to a nowin situation 
So does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in

  Why or how actually can a Powerbook have a  x  pixel
    display regardless if it is a  or  and still keep the
     dpi resolution  I assume that it doesn't and I don't 
    mean to imply they all have these dimensions


  Any info on price drops or new models nonDuo coming up

Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own

Here's why People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a  processor
in it Apple can't deliver that right now because the  saps too much
power radiates far too much heat and is too large for a notebook How
does one get around that without designing a new chipset Use existing
PowerBook technology to your best advantage The Duo Dock gives Apple a
unique ability to give users that  power in a SemiPortable fashion
By plunking the  into the Dock you've got quadra power at your desk
On the road that mhz  should be able to handle most of your needs
Okay not the BEST solution but its an answer to a nowin situation 
So does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in
parallel to the dock's processor Okay we're getting REALLY hypothetical
now 

It would also be great for another reason  when not docked it could serve
as an ARA server to the large internal HD your corporate email etc  In
a pinch you would also have two machines instead of 

If they could couple that thought with RocketShare and let you use both the
' on the PB and the ' on the dock it would be a mighty powerful dock

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo
properly

When I first got it the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected and I had to pull it the rest of the way Nowadays and I've
had the system for  months the Duo doesn't come out at all  despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself Is there a simple fix for this or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display no VRAM no floppy or
SCSI etc 

BTW it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock  it just doesn't
want to slide out any more

        I thought NEC and Toshiba CDROM mechanism have an average

 Chung Yang

The Toshiba has a ms access time the NEC has a ms access
time right around the SonyApple Access time is of course
somewhat important but not as vital in the case of CDs as data
transfer rate

All the drives are doublespeed drives with maximum data transfer
rates of Ksecond Any is a good choice Apple's is very cheap
when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment
about drivers

Plus Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra  A very nice
feature if you need to install System software I don't know if the
NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse not just
releasing the ball and getting to the rollers I found that on the
original ADB mouse sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for
easier cleaning

If the original poster has his answer I'll ask How do you open the
new ergonomic mouse By open I mean split the two halves to get at
the guts It isn't obvious to me based on the  minute look I spent

 you can get on the DOS side What do you think of this Do you feel the same
 thing about it Just curious

Sounds about right

If there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to
aggresively cut prices  Once the demand fall off a bit then is the
time to start getting aggressive with pricing  Waiting too long can
really hurt your business though 

The PowerBooks have sold very well up to now if they are slowing
down Apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions the
only reason I own a PowerBook is that I could spring for a  PB
the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me  I'd bet they'll
be coming out with more power versions too

Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer but has stumped
myself and a few others

What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set through control panel in your SIMMs

EX  I have a Mac IIci with  meg RAM an external video card so I don't
rob my SIMM's and the default Apple cache card I believe this is K 
Say I have my cache set at  MEG what good does a measly K do me on the
cache card  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the SIMM's  Or does it still speed things up by
providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into
the SIMM RAM cache

I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself  Yet Daystar
FastCache has numbers which show around a  performance boost on some
operations  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM
accesses

Please help I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci
system described in the EX above

Hello all
	I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE and was
wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me
	I am mostly thinking about a  color monitor and an  bit card that
can switch between  and something higher like   I read an
old report on a card from Lapis that could do this but could not use the
external monitor as the main screen with menubar which to me is a major draw
back  Has this perhaps been fixed Or can any other cards do this like the
Micron Xceed 
	Also which monitor should I buy  At the moment I am leaning towards
the Sony  s or  what exactly is the difference between these
but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about  Doesn't the
monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions

Please send me email and I'll summarize

I would also greatly appreciate getting the email addresses of any mail order
companys that sell monitors or cards

Thanks in advance

I believe that in order to get at the innards of the new mouse
you must remove the label on the bottom that says Apple Desktop
Bus Mouse II  There you should find two screws on either side
I haven't tried it myself yet but when I ran my fingernail
accross the label these two divots appeared and I can only assume
that these are the elusive screws in question

followed to return them to which the person replied You mean you sent them
US Mail which I had per the original sales person's instructions  I was
told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon come on and that
I should have sent the stuff via FedEx etc  


I also returned PB memory last summer for credit and the sales person warned
me not to use US mail  I did although I did insure the shipment and 
apparently Techworks got it

My minor grip with techworks is that they have different price lists for
different people  I ordered DUO memory thinking I got their best price
because of my employeer  I subsequently found out that Apple was offering
developers memory for less than techworks charged called up to complain
and was told I should have said I was an apple developer and they credited
my card for about  of the purchase price   I like techworks quality
and installation instructions and they include powerbook tools but 
for outofCA purchases no sales tax chip merchant seems to be a bit less

I would like to know what people's opinions are about the

a coprocessor

I don't use anything like Mathamatica Maple etc I don't use
Spreadsheets at least no sheets with complicated anything I
don't use D CAD apps although I used to 

I DO  use D renderers EXTENSIVE communications I run a BBS
I write software I write papers etc

BTW just for kicks this is what I was told by my local Apple
Rep about upgrading a LC to a RC on a C
Well Apple built in an extra socket for the coprocessor chip
 That way you just plug in the coprocessor and it works
I then heartily laughed and hung up the phone

Does anyone know how to open up the Apple ErgoMouse ADB Mouse II
Mine lives near a cat true really and picks up her fur  From what
I can tell it looks like Apple welded it shut

    You must not have tried very hard I just opend mine in about 
seconds Take a look on the bottom it has a dial that turns to open
much like the older ADB mouses used to have It's a bit harder to turn
at first but it is quite simple to open


Nope  I'm pretty sure that this person knows how to take the ball out
I think that what they want to do is take the mouse apart  The old mouse
had four screws on the bottom that you could unscrew to do this
while there's no obvious way to take the new one apart

Hi I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought
I would post it for those interested parties Sorry for length

To increase the MacIISi speed to MHz or MHz the clock must be changed
from MHz to MHz or MHz respectively
This is done by going to a staticfree work station or putting some
aluminum foil down to work on
	 Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case
	 Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables
		spreading the tabs and lifting the drive out
	 Remove the flopy drive
	 Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting
		the supply straight up and out
	 Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back bottom
		side of the fan and lifting straight up and out
	 Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and
		right side of the board and sliding the board forward then
		lifting the board out all connectors on the back of the
		board must be removed first
	 Desolder the MHz clock the one closest to the memory modules
		This is not easy even for a skilled solderer
	 Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins
		by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers
	 Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder 
		them in
	Insert a MHz or MHz clock
	Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and 
		the other large chip just to the right of the processor and
		figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place I made a
		simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole
		in the board between the two chips Mount the screw using
		insulated washers Screw a cross member down over the heat
		sync's to hold them in place Don't use too much pressure

	 Put it all back together and goforit

Disclaimer this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone
	    You are on your own for this procedure I'm quite sure it will
	    void your warentee

Bye for now

Does anyone work with the AROSE card

We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the
system and lets crash the Mac then

Okay we don't use the card quite like one should because we simulate
errors in the  Before every instruction some specified registers are
masked eg to simulate a stuckaterror in certain bits

Normally the crash instance of AROSE notices a crash sets a flag and
stops working By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card
crash That works fine for almost all crashes but as said sometimes the
card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system

The documentation of AROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior
when crashing and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing
the assembler code and that's both frustrating and lengthy

So can anyone help
Please only reply via email as I don't read this group

We have recently obtained a Centris  and it has developed an unusual
video problem 

Model	 with  MB HD K VRAM no cards
Monitor	Apple 

When the computer is set for  colors and certain operations are done
particularly vertical scrolling through a window horizontal white lines
appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open
windows  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued  If a
window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
the line disappear from that area of the screen  This problem is not
observed if the monitor is configured for  colors or a  inch Apple
monitor with  colors is used 

I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain  The problem has
been apparent since day  but has gotten worse

We were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this and if so how
to fix it  Please also respond to azelenetbigmacmskccorg  Thank you
for your help

There's this old SE here It's got the olderstyle fans that remind
me of a houseventilator A cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor
I usually see Anyway the SE makes this loud buzzing noise due
to vibration somewheres If I remove the screws and loosen the front
from the back it quiets down I can only assume that the fan housing
from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating
against it 

Anyway any suggestions for where to get replacement fans and how to
stealth this guy Your experiences welcome

Since we are on the subject of chip power consumption

I heard from a very reliable source that the DEC Alpha chip uses
 the power that Intel's Pentium chip does and it still whips
the Pentium's butt  Makes you wonder why Intel ever made
a chip to begin with

Wouldn't you like a PowerBook Alpha running about  MIPS  Cool idea


	Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt Sorry  wrong It would be an
extremely hot ideaat least with the current Alphas The available
Alphas run up to  MHz But they produce quite a bit of heat In
fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat
sinks
	Also Apple looks pretty commited to the PowerPC route instead
of a deal with DEC

I have a chance to buy a used PS Appletalk card to create a network with
my home machines  However the guy who has the card tells me there's a
DB or DB can't remember now on the back of the card rather than
the pin or pin minidin that I expect  This sounds more like a
Thicknet ethernet card  Should there be a transciever on it like on the
Quadras  What would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of
these cards keeping in mind that it's MicroChannel Architecture which
means take your best guess and double it

 This does not make sencewhy would the FG work but the FGx not

 x with
 SVGAwhat's the dealanyway you can get a SVGA  with mm and
 x 
 for  at Damarkare you saing that it probably would work while a
  NEC won't
The FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of KHz so driving it
at KHz to get  x  on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The FG is spec'ed at KHz so going KHz is only  above
the minimally guaranteed figure

I too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at  x             Like most things you get what you pay  That's the deal

reboots

    I wonder if your Mac has those little RESET  INTERUPT switches
    installed  They are plastic devices that push on the switches which
    are inside the mac  Or mabey those switches are bad and need
    replacing

This problem is usually a low  Vdc from the power supply there is an  
adjustment for this on the supply If the voltage is still unstable or low  
then the culprit is probably a bad rectifier at CR

I've noticed an interesting phenomenon on my Centris  If I unplug the

the mouse suddenly switches to about half its normal movement speed I check
the Mouse control panel and there's no change in its setting thereit's
still on full speed the way I like it Restarting the machine restores the
normal mouse speed

By the way it happens with both the newerstyle mouse that came with the
Centris and the olderstyle mouse from my IIfx at work Thus I don't think
it has anything to do with the resolution setting in the mouseit's
definitely a quirk of the ADB interface either hardware or software in the
Centris itself
 
I have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my LCIII  Perhaps it is
a quirk of the new machines

the CDAudio using the sound control panel by clicking on the Options
button next to the microphone icon

How do you click on the Options button  I've never seen it undimmed

    The latest word on this is you have to disconnect the Microphone
cable on the motherboard Then the button is supposed to undim

Sorry I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal
CDROM bay worked the same as the Quadra   Obviously they don't
I can use any of three inputs by changing the radio button under
the sound cp on my Quadra  Microphone External and CDROM  I
always leave the microphone plugged in even though I never use
it

A while ago I posted a note asking for specs on the Quadra  and opinions on
the Q upgrade of a IIci vs an accelerator card  So far no responsed that
I've noticed  Please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade
paths  Cost efficiency proscons etc Thanks

  Complete Q are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
copy of MacWorld or MacUser  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
comparison factors visavis a IIci are as follows

   MHz 
   Mhz data path don't recall this for sure but it's slower
      than Q  style machines for sure
  Ethertalk card onboard
  Audio inout
   MB RAM on motherboard
   SIMM slots
   NuBus slots
  More flexible buildin video than the CI  Uses VRAM

In comparison a IIci with an accelerator won't give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video options
  With a  accelerator CPU performance can be comparable but I
  think it ends up costing more

 What's this  My IIvx with an internal CD doesn't have any CDAudio
 icon

I can't find any such option on my Centris  either On the other hand I
don't see why I need one If I try recording sound with the builtin
microphone with an audio CD playing in the drive I get the CD audio mixed
in with the microphone sound

And I guess if I unplug the microphone then I'll get uncontaminated CD
audio admittedly sampled at  bits through a DAD conversion

Sorry about the misinformation  I made a bad assumption about
the new machines behaving like a Quadra  see previous
post  About sampling the CD audio though have you tried it  I 
found the aliasing to be really bad  Like it needed a filter or something
Much worse than I expected  I installed the CD in the 
Quadra myself so maybe I missed something  Everything else
works great though

After having used both Syqyest and Bernoulli's I most enthuiastically
recommend
Bernoulli's Syquests although more popular are much slower prone to
cartridge

What does your friends have Buy it

If you have no friends buy a  MB optical and stop

I bought a Bernoulli pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of
 diffrent storage solutions
OPTICAL drives are SLOW very slow compared to  to ms access of Bernoulli

Since I needed additinol online storage rather than just a backup or archiev
e disk I choosed Bernoulli drive I use Adobe Preimere and Quicktime movies
alot you ran out of storage real fast

IMHO the best buy currently is the Bernoulli Multidisk MB per cartridge

 I am working a  data acquisition and analysis program to collect data
 from insect sensory organs
 Another alternative is the use of the sound input port

Can you really make due with the nonexistent dynamic range of an bit
converter of probably dubious linearity and monotonicity and perhaps
ACcoupled as well

It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data for some
purposes  resolution with or without calibration curve


Otherwise the other possibilities would be

 get a digital voltameter with serial output  connect to serial
port on mac collect data with some communications program

 Buy an AD chip from Analog devices BurrBrown etc connect to
a parallel to serial converter use serial port for acquisition
nah too much soldering and trouble shooting 

 Get a board from National Instruments Data Translation Omega
etal  The finest solution but possibly the most costly



To the original poster  if the signal is too large why not
use a voltage divider Two resistors cost very cheap

 Can running a PowerBook's battery completely flat have any

 Only two things I can think of
   Although NiCad c batteries should be  
completely
     discharged about once a month LeadAcid batteries  shouldn't  
ever be
     completely discharged well maybe ONCE in a while is OKAY
 
 This is a very common misconception dealing with Nicad batteries  It  
is 
 a good idea to completely discharge a nicad CELL periodically  It is
 NOT a good idea to completely discharge a nicad BATTERY  The  
difference
 being that a cell is only one cell nicad puts out  volts like a
 rechargeable AAA AA C or D  A battery is defined as more than one
 cell  volt or  for nicad equivalent  Due to differences in the
 individual cells of a battery complete discharge can actually harm
 a nicad battery more than help it overcome the memory effect  The
 most common problem is that over time an individual cell can develop
 internal shorts which will weaken other cells that are connected to
 it thus reducing the lifespan of your battery pack
 
etc

Okay naive question How does one discharge a cell without discharging  
the entire battery

The ones that I could locate in Microcenter catalogue were

Tripp Lite's Isobar Command COnsole 

Proxima Power Director

you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational

I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices
I went for a retailer actually mail order CDA computers because its price
was better thant the campus computer store I found out why later on when I
tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center  the CPU was a
resale The serial number had been removed and replaced with a nonstandard
number probably from CDA computers Consequently the Apple repair man could
not do ANY warrenty repairs So I ended up with just a day warrenty from CDA
over the Apple month warrenty Boy was I pied Moral of the story CAVEAT
EMPTOR

However if you go with a reliable trustworthy mail order firm if they exist
 maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences you will probably
get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order
out of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet Though for how much longer remains
to be seen The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out
an educational discount Again CAVEAT EMPTOR some mail order companies DO
include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state so check

 I guess this changes my opinion of them and I thought I would warn
 any prospective customers for the ENSC PB

FWIW I work for FOCUS Enhancements and a lot of the people we sell our
EtherLAN SCSCT our SCSI Ethernet interface are disgruntled ENSC
users

 I also now need to know if anyone has been successful with the
 comparable product from Dayna or Focus I really don't want to use up
 that NuBus slot

Sigh  I wish I had better news  The FOCUS EtherLAN SC is currently
incompatible with the Duos  This may change in the future  We do have
Apple Register Compatible cards that are  compatible with the
DuoDocks though

Send questions to focusapplelinkapplecom

I've noticed an interesting phenomenon on my Centris  If I unplug
the 
keyboard and mouse and plug them in again without turning the power
off 
the mouse suddenly switches to about half its normal movement speed I 
check the Mouse control panel and there's no change in its setting 
thereit's still on full speed the way I like it Restarting the
machine 
restores the normal mouse speed 

By the way it happens with both the newerstyle mouse that came with
the 
Centris and the olderstyle mouse from my IIfx at work Thus I don't
think 
it has anything to do with the resolution setting in the mouseit's 
definitely a quirk of the ADB interface either hardware or software
in 
the Centris itself 

I have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my LCIII Perhaps
it 
is a quirk of the new machines 


Sorry but mine works fine  C

In the MacUser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned

What is it  I don't recall seeing it in Dale Adams post

of course it was in Dale's post just not in the words that MacUser 
used  ROM accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands
has been rewritten inside the ROM to take advantage of the 
addressing modes  commands that do fills should be slightly faster
since the new instructions fetch  bytes at a time versus one

A professor of mine once said The difference between a Computer Engineer and
a Computer Scientist is about  meaning the Engineer makes  more than
the CS
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use ie database graphics word processors etc while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems ie the computer in your
car a flight control system computer controled devices etc In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE 
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is

anyone let me know where that socket is on the motherboard I have obtained
a PMMU chip  Mhz from a surplus store and would like to install it onto
my Mac II circa  But I cannot see the socket myself when I tried to

 I recently purchased a Centris  and a Mirror Technologies  inch

 of the CPU  The monitor weighs  lbs

 I've called Apple  The person I spoke with was not sure but was
 going to find out and call me back in a couple of days  That was
 over a week ago

 If anybody knows please respond via email as I don't always have time

Yea thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup I was prepared
for lots of details even shipping time  got my C CD in  weeks
I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written
specs and documentation  The case load spec is an example  the setup
section says Apple  and  monitors can go on top but  and other
big ones can't  Why couldn't they publish a maximum load

Now if I can figure out if there's any hope using the partition button
on the hard disk setup utility do I dare just try it and see what happens
then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
securly  The getting more information section of the manual suggested
trying other avenues before calling Apple but didn't mention the net

have a  day turn around time meaning you should receive the
inspectedrepaired keyboard in that time  Well they have had the
keyboard for over  weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it It's annoying because it cost me  to send them
the keyboard they do not refund the money and their costumer service
lines are toll calls Tell me if you have a similar experience

you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational
prices 

I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices
I went for a retailer actually mail order CDA computers because its price
was better thant the campus computer store I found out why later on when I
tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center  the CPU was a
resale The serial number had been removed and replaced with a nonstandard
number probably from CDA computers Consequently the Apple repair man could
not do ANY warrenty repairs So I ended up with just a day warrenty from CDA
over the Apple month warrenty Boy was I pied Moral of the story CAVEAT
EMPTOR
 
Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order  As a result mail order
companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market

This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have
more machines than they can sell  They come into this state of affairs
by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better
wholsale price from Apple  In either case they often obscure the serial
nunber to protect their identity  As a result the warranty is void

You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping

I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices
thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer
cost  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs
and trimming margins  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well 
The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest
prices available from authorised local dealers

They are even further away from educational prices

 I'm in the market for a Postscript compatible laser writer  My needs
 are pretty modest so  dpi  pages a minute would be just fine
 My budget is also pretty modest so inexpensive would also be good
 It will be working from a single mac but networkability would 
 probably be a good investment for the future

 With that in mind

  Anyone have comments about the suitabilityqualityvalue of a GCC
 BLP Elite printer

I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it  My
needs
are much the same as what you describe  In addition I wanted to get one
that
I could access via AppleTalk so that eliminated the new line of
inexpensive 
printers from Apple  The print quality is good to excellent based on
what 
font you're using and what paper you use  I'm still experimenting with 
different papers but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work
fine

Printing envelopes transpariencies letter head or other single feed
jobs is
very easy  There is an adjustable automatic centering guide on top of
the
sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly and doesn't feed a sheet
from
the sheet feeder as some do

I have no affiliation with GCC just a satisfied customer

 I'm going to buy a DayStar  with  MHz for the SE Since there
 were so many mails about problems with this board my questions
 does the board work with  and AUX   Does anybody know problems
 with any kind of software 
 
 Well I haven't seen any reports of problems with the Turbo '
 but to my knowledge Daystar has not released a version of the 
 board that works with anything but the IIsi and IIci and they
 have not finished tweakingtesting for use with AUX  This may
 not happen until the AUX  upgrade is released my guess so 
 I'd recommend waiting or buying the  MHz ' board and upgrade
 later when AUX compatibility is assured  Turbo ' interface 
 cards for the II IIx SE IIcx etc will probably be available
 sooner but if AUX compatibility is a requirement it is probably
 best to be patient and let someone else be the pioneer  

An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE is that
just as with the ' power cache the ' accelerator will plug into
the CPU socket leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernet
card  With DayStar's upgrade path it's a no lose situation

I've just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to  mhz I'm waiting
on delivery of a  mhz clock for a final speed trial Definitely needed the
heatsink The CPU was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until I glued
on a  cent Radio Shack sink 

I made a call for reports of failures last week No reports have arrived
here Locally in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the user
slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board  not exactly
a problem due to the CPU running too fast

I think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system
configurations including PDS and Nubus cards which were used I'd be happy
to coordinate and report results

 Can you really make due with the nonexistent dynamic range of an bit
 converter of probably dubious linearity and monotonicity and perhaps
 ACcoupled as well

It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many
cases it will do fine The critical information from the neuron is in
the firing frequency maximum about  action potentials per
seconds and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the
signal shape So the resolution of about   you get with an  bit
convertor is more then sufficient

AC coupling does not have to be a problem either since in many cases
you are not interested in the DC level My pre amplifier is AC coupled
also The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass If
the cutoff point is to high the action potentials will be slightly
distorted But even that normally does not matter since it is the
occurrence of the spike that is important 

However I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start
battling with the toolbox to get it going As yet I have no clue were
to start looking for the technical specifications

The trackbal on my PB no longer moves in the horizontal direction  When I
called the nearest Authorized Apple Service person I was told that it probably
needed replacing and that would cost me over   Ouch
  Can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem  One strange
symptom of the problem is that when I take the ball out of the socket and shine
a light into the hole I can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the
wheel with my finger it works fine that way but won't work if I turn off the
light  Any suggestions or comments

Ben Roy just a poor college studentinternetbraamericanedu


Ben

Since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works
the only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough
cleaning of all the parts and then checking for the proper placement of
the little blue rollers Since they aren't fixed in position on their
stainless steel pins you might try sliding them into a slightly different
position On my PowerBook  I can slide them almost completely out of
contact with the trackball In fact one of the notes from sumex on fixing
the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its edge contacts the
ball not the center cylindrical area

I've done this with my PB and it does seem to improve the feel but
needs to be adjusted from time to time I just popped open one of our
office's PBs and while there isn't as much latitude for movement one
could still adjust the roller slightly If your PB is the same it might
help

I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller If
you can take it out clean it with a mild soapy solution or isopropyl 
alcohol Also be sure the ball is greasefree

If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring roll the ball and see
if it is actually causing the axle to spin 

If all this still doesn't solve it then maybe a new one is in order 
It could be an electrical connection in which case replacement would be
necessary But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that
dirt has been the normal problem not an electrical malfunction

Hope this helps

I have the same problem and was about to post this

Hello duo owners and Apple technical people 
 
I have a new duo  which appears to have a problem waking up from
sleep when running on battery power When woken usually for the second
time after sleeping the wake fails and the screen appears with a
corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be
recovered with controlcommandpoweron or the reset key at the back of
the machine The problem occurs even when the system is stock standard
no extensions no virtual memory a fully charged new battery system 
etc I have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to AC
I've checked that the battery is properly seated it appears to be fine
 
What's going on here  Anyone else had this problem  Is it software or
hardware  
 
If you have a duo  and a bit of time try repeatedly sleeping and
waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same
behaviour and let Apple know too 
 
Many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me
 
Bruce

Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up

About hard drive companies the original  meg drive that was bad bad
sector or something was an IBM  The new one is a Quantum  Is the LCIII
supposed to be shipped with IBMs  Is there a quality difference 
Apparently 

Second about hard drive position  I've put the LCIII on its side and
the new  HD has had no problems at all  I've even switched back and
forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems  As far
as I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up
to  meg in any computer  Don't know about CDROM though

I've had a couple of email responses from people who seem to believe that
this sort of thing is not only unsupported it is downright dangerous

I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple Just to be sure I
asked a couple of our technicians one of whom has been servicing Macs for
years There is no danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging
ADB devices with the power on

Noooooooo  I've been servicing Macs for years too and I've had to
repair a number of motherboards that had been damaged this way  It's
rare but it does happen

Mind you this doesn't mean you shouldn't do it  The parts that can
blow the ADB power fuse and RF filter aren't too expensive so IF you
have a someone around who can do componentlevel repair it may be worth
the risk especially if you're around Seattle 'cause you might get to
pay me to fix it   On the other hand if your only repair option
is the Applestandard logic board swap major  you should probably
play it safe

Okay I don't use it very much but I would like for it to keep working
correctly at least as long as Apple continues to make System software
that will run on it if slowly 

Here is the problem  When the screen is tilted too far back vertical
lines appear on the screen  They are every  pixels or so and seem
to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus
It looks to a semitechnical person like there is a loose connection
between the screen and the rest of the computer

I am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer
or taking this one to the shop  I would also like to not have
to buy one of Larry Pina's books  I like Larry but I'm not sure
I feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual
for it

On a related note  what does the monitor connector connect to

Not necessarily a thridparty adapter Apple does manufacture transceivers
for thinWire and BaseT twisted pair cable media as well as an AUI
Attachment Unit Interface transciever They run at  each If you use
thinWire or BaseT you'll probably also need terminators Apple's
transceivers are selfterminated if I remember correctly but I have no
idea about DECs 

The thirdparty media adapters are usually cheaper at least in Toronto than
Apple's I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple

gurmanumbragsfcnasagov Joseph B Gurman writes
    The DECstation  Models  and  come with ThinWire only
can't say for certain about the Models  and  so your best bet

That's not true Only the DECstation  comes with a Thinwire
BNC coaxial Ethernet connector The   and 
all have a single pin AUI Ethernet connector only I distinctly
remembered this because when got the  first and I thought all
of them are going to be Thinwire I eventually had to go back and ordered
DESTAs DEC's oversized version of an AUItoBNC adapter that MUST be used
with a transciever cable for the rest of the stations

My advise to the very original poster Beverly is

 If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add
    machines to it EVER go for Thinwire regardless of the media type Going
    for UTP unshielded twisted pair wiring requires a concentrator which
    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least  ports
    As for Thicknet it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive Avoid it
    unless you have no choice eg the two machines are two floors parts

 On the Mac side you will need
     one Thinwire media adapter from Apple or thirdparty
     MacX make sure you get version   won't run on System 
     MacTCP which comes with MacX if you get MacX v you should be
      getting MacTCP v with it Don't use earlier versions on a Centris
     you may or may not need a ohm terminator depending on the
      Thinwire media adapter So just ask the sales if the adapter is
      selfterminated or not
     configure MacTCP to use Ethernet

 On the DECstation side you will need
     for a Model  you will only need a Tconnector
     for Models     you will need an AUItoBNC adapter
      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the
      DECstation This way you save the cost of a transciever cable
      a pin AUI male to a pin AUI female cable

I am looking for one of those color LCD screens you
place on an overhead projector and control the presentation
with a Mac

Can you recommend me a particular brand
What price are we talking about

For a good display you must get an active matrix panel and a very
bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel ie
stage must not get too hot I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked
it but I needed a brighter projector I used it with a M  It is
also too expensive for what you get IMHO Prices of active matrix panels
are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year something to do
with tarrifs being lifted I think 

In Canadian dollars the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about
 to  and a good overhead projector about  to  For
that kind of money you can get a brighter image from a three beam
projector but sacrifice portability

Oh yes proper room lighting is extremely important especially if you
want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that
light wash out your display at the front of the room Tricky to get right

I have an old Mac Plus A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc
It came with apple's new keyboard with abd ports i replaced it with
a macproplus extended keyboard which i thoroughly enjoy thank you
very much
 
well i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus
but there's a little problem the plus uses an rj jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboards don't i got an extra adb cable from my
local apple dealer they're such nice people but they couldn't tell
me the order of the wires
 
there are four wires in the adb cables black white red tan I know
one's a ground one gets the serial signal one supplies  volts and
i forgot what the fourth one does anyway if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i really don't want to do that
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before please email your
experience directly to me i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not    ergonomically correct
 
btw i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj jack and the adb since it
has both but no such luck the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes Oh well

I just recently bought a  MB ram card for my original mac portable 
backlit and have since had some bizarre crashes It happens when I put 
the machine to sleep and wake the machine up sometimes it will just 
freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset 
switch Other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error 
message of Co processor not installed 

I know one solution is NOT to put the machine to sleep but does anyone 
have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix 
it The memory card is Psuedostatic ram and goes into the PDS Slot That 
probably figures into the problem the manufacturer is King Memory Not 
kingston from irvine CA They say the problem is in my machine 

Any Ideas  Gene Wright

Yes what you are saying is absolutey true but what you fail to mention is the
fact that the LCIII uses the new  pin simms which allow  bit access to

I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple Just to be sure I
asked a couple of our technicians one of whom has been servicing Macs for
years There is no danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging
ADB devices with the power on

The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector 
are close to each other and if you happen to bend the
cable a little while inserting it you short the ADB
port If you take it to an Apple Repair Centre that
means a new motherboard though a component replace IS
physically possible

Same goes for serial ports LocalTalk as well

I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a
mac We would like to try it and I wonder if someone had some good
advice

We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum MB hard disk
and an unusable floppy drive We also have a new spare Connor MB
disk which we would like to use The idea is to replace the broken
floppy drive with the new hard disk but there seems to be some
problems

The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only
connectors for one single hard disk drive

If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each
 for motherboard  for each of the  disks would it work

Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk

What about terminators I suppose that i should remove the resistor
packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard but leave them
installed in the other disk

The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets
ID  The old one should have ID 

It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive as we have an
external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk

Thank you

 ATTENTION Mac Quadra owners Many storage industry experts have
 concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
 from the standard SCSI specification This results in silent corruption
 of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices
 Although I will not name the devices since it is not their fault an
 example would be a Sony  inch MO without the special Maccompatible
 firmware installed One solution sometimes is to disable blind writes

This doesn't sound right to me  Don't Quadras use the C  If so the
Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing  That's all handled by the
chip  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the
clock registers wrong on the   That however should only really hurt
synchronous transfer which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager

Furthermore disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra
On Macs that used the  which is a much lower level SCSI chip the
Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred  Blind
mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake  On the  the
handshake is entirely handled by the chip

The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week and I'd like to
hear any reasonable theories folks can suggest for what happened

It is an LC with MB of RAM and an MB internal drive running system
 with a few SCSI devices in a so far as I know properly terminated
chain

I had shut down the system for a day I was out of town and we sometimes
have thunderstorms this time of year and upon restarting got a blinking
question mark  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed
okay but there was no sign of the internal

I installed a system folder on the external and was indeed able to boot
from it  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining to inquire
about the internal drive  They either could not find it or got errors in
trying to talk to it Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive but it
is a Quantum 

Well I'd backed things up so I was able to work  But at some point I
noticed that the internal had reappeared  Now Disk First Aid says that
all's well etc  Things seem to be fine

But what happened  Was this a warning that something the internal HD
or something else is about to die  I'm definitely nervous

And if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick is it true that I
can only put up to a MB drive inside an LC  Some folks have claimed
there's a limitation in the LC other'n size or power while others and
that includes LaCie over the phone say anything that fits is okay

Thanks for answers

 Point me to documentation on power management so that I can write such

 Explain to me why such an init is totally or partially impossible

Ideally of course I would like to be able to turn in on and off on the

Surely such an init would be very helpful to Powerbook owners who want to

My Datadesk Mac E keyboard has similar problems I have found that
holding down the RIGHTHAND shift key at startup will work disable
extensions but the lefthand shift key won't which is unfortunate since
the left one is the one I instinctively reach for

Similarly I have trained myself to hold down the RIGHTHAND pair of
commandoption for desktop rebuilds

I is irritating

Cheers

 Excuse me if this is a frequent question I checked in
 several FAQs but couldn't really find anything

You are excused the answer varies from Mac to Mac so it would be
a complex answer in the FAQ
 
 I have a IIsi with the standard  meg memory and I want
 need to add additional memory  But I'm on a budget
 I really don't need more than  meg max so what is
 the best performance wise and most economical way
 to do this  Someone told me that I should only use
 SIMMs of the same amount of memory that is   meg
   meg etc  What if I just wanted to buy just   meg
 and use the rest of what I already have  The manual
 hasn't been very helpful with this
 
The si uses a  bit wide data bus and therefore you must use  bit
wide simms  Sorry but no short cuts here

 Thanks

You're quite welcome

I had the same question for my lb NEC FG monitor The Apple guy said that
their lb  monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment
beyond that I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to 
thinking  the monitor has a small tiltswivel base so maybe the weight
would be more concentrated than with Apple's I don't know the area of the 
base of their tiltswivel Additionally the CDROM drive is in the middle
So I cut a piece of  thick wood to about  x  covered it in a 
cream covered cloth and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris's top
and the monitor

The magnet trick will work Be careful when you apply the white tape to the
rubber carriage roller it tells the scanner where the edge is and it can come
off

	Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  
vertical position  If the drive is formatted in a horizontal position it can  
not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position   
I'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or  months from now but  
why take that chance  If you want more detailed info on the problem please

I asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my  on 
it's side  I received a response from someone at Seagate Sorry I 
trashed the message stating that most newer drives Seagates at the 
least can very well compensate for gravity  This means that a 
horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data 
integrity problems  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you 
have varying forces shaking bouncing etc so don't place the drive on 
it's side on a rocking chair   What constitutes a 'newer' drive I 
don't know try calling your drive manufacturer  I have a Quantum LPS 
internal and since I got it a month ago I am guessing it's 'newer'

 ATTENTION Mac Quadra owners Many storage industry experts have
 concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
 from the standard SCSI specification This results in silent corruption
 of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices
 Although I will not name the devices since it is not their fault an
 example would be a Sony  inch MO without the special Maccompatible
 firmware installed One solution sometimes is to disable blind writes

This doesn't sound right to me  Don't Quadras use the C  If so the
Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing  That's all handled by the
chip  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the
clock registers wrong on the   That however should only really hurt
synchronous transfer which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager

Furthermore disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra
On Macs that used the  which is a much lower level SCSI chip the
Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred  Blind
mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake  On the  the
handshake is entirely handled by the chip

The docs say that it's a SCSI Manager bug if this changes things at all

 The Mac II is supposed to have a socket for the MC PMMU chip Could
anyone let me know where that socket is on the motherboard I have obtained
a PMMU chip  Mhz from a surplus store and would like to install it onto
my Mac II circa  But I cannot see the socket myself when I tried to
install it

The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset
of the 's functions  If you look underneath your front left floppy
bay you will find three chips all approximately the same size  One will
be the  the next the  and the third approximately the same
size will be the Apple chip  It is easy to spot because it has a 'hump'
in the middle of it


Example


                         
                                   
                      
                                                  
                                                  

That and the Apple logo should make it easy to find

Officially no From experience yours now included yes Quantums seem to
be the most problemfree brand on the Mac

Second about hard drive position  I've put the LCIII on its side and
the new  HD has had no problems at all  I've even switched back and
forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems  As far
as I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up
to  meg in any computer  Don't know about CDROM though

It should not matter for the hard drive or the Mac  Well as long as it
doesn't fall over

Well I also have an LC III  Popping the top revealed

	One socket for an additional VRAM SIMM

	One socket for a pin RAM SIMM

	One socket for a flatpack FPU

	A processordirect slot PDS identical to the LCLC II but with
	an additional set of connetions to one side for the full bit

That's it  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit

The Partition button in Apple's HD Setup lets you set up AUX and other
types of partitions It WON'T let you create more than one normal mac
volume You need SilverLining or something similar to do that It WILL
however allow you to take advantage of some possible unused space on your
hard disk if you don't mind reformatting the whole thing

        I cannot speak for Dale But I am quite sure that the Macintosh 
uses the full bit or bit data path to its full advantage That is 
it is running as fast with two or four pin SIMMs as it would with one 
pin SIMM Now it may be that longword accesses assuming a bit 
data path here get the first byte from the first SIMM the second byte 
from the second and so on This would mean that each longword of memory 
is actually split among four SIMMs one for each byte On the other hand 
it could be that the SIMMs are interleaved by word or longword not just 
by byte or they could be successive in memory and the memory 
controller deals with the eightbit data path that each one has I 
suspect though that they are interleaved to some extent so that  bits 
can be read or written at once This would indicate a bytelevel 
interleave
        I am NOT confusing this with the new machines' longword 
interleave with two pin SIMMs of the same sort although that seems to 
be the same sort of idea There you get an essential bit data path ro 
excuse me to RAM instead of just a bit one Yes the CPU can't 
handle it but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something 
up
        So Dale am I right pin SIMMs are interleaved by bytes 
allowing the full data bus Or as is common with Usenet and me in 
particular am I as clueless as everyone else

What conclusion can be drawn from this  I'm trying to figure out what kind
of memory configuration for the LC III bit datapath would be fastest  Any
ideas

Hi what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have if
they want to go at least  baud

Every place in town says they are back ordered and part of the reason
I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from
wherever I am but I really would hate to have to wait  months to get
a modem in or have to settle with  baud

That's fine but would you name the industy experts so I can try to track

 This doesn't sound right to me  Don't Quadras use the C  If so the

 Yes you get internal mixing of the analog CDAudio outputs with

 How do you click on the Options button  I've never seen it undimmed
 
     The latest word on this is you have to disconnect the Microphone
 cable on the motherboard Then the button is supposed to undim

The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed 
I don't believe the button undims since there's nothing to select  I
haven't tracked down a Centris to check this on though

 Sorry I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal

found is with MS Word a If you have a table the is longer than
a page and the cells have a visible border the last bottom of page
line on the first page will be missing It makes no difference how
the table is formatted The worst is that it doesn't show up in word's

I have an old Mac Plus A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc
It came with apple's new keyboard with abd ports i replaced it with
a macproplus extended keyboard which i thoroughly enjoy thank you
very much
 
well i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus
but there's a little problem the plus uses an rj jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboards don't i got an extra adb cable from my
local apple dealer they're such nice people but they couldn't tell
me the order of the wires
 
there are four wires in the adb cables black white red tan I know
one's a ground one gets the serial signal one supplies  volts and
i forgot what the fourth one does anyway if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i really don't want to do that
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before please email your
experience directly to me i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not    ergonomically correct
 
btw i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj jack and the adb since it
has both but no such luck the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes Oh well   
 
one more thing in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the
newer models are different from the connection used on the plus
you're right however you can use the telephone cable from the plus
and connect the macproplus keyboard via its own rj jack in
other words this little engineering feat i wish to do is possible
it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order
 
omt when i get this to work i definitely will post the solution
so others can too thanx for the input

I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in
the next few weeks  The plan I have is to build a small board with a few
different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different
speeds using a front pannel switch  This way I can get the speed when
I want but I can also run at slower stock speeds it I experience any
compatability problems with any applications  I don't expect to be able
to switch clock speeds with the system running but if I can switch
without any lockup problems then I could switch to MHz when needed
and put it back to idle  MHz when not needeed  This would further
reduce the wearandtear on the CPU even with a heat sink  Of course
I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch
but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and
route it directly to the mother board

I haven't started probing around inside my si yet  Does anyone know the
voltage level to power the crystal oscilators

Well I am using The Home Office I bought it for arounde 
It does  I don't know if it's for data or fax But the
feature I use is the Voic Mail Box which I really have liked

Do the accelaratores make a lot of difference
As I understand there is graphics and cpu accelaration

Does graphics accelarator help out with the scanner and
the photo shop

Is combination of both practical

I have a Mac IIci What kinds of accelaratores can I use

I have a Macc IIci and a Color scanner
I scanned a picture at  dpi When I try to print
it on my HP color printer after  minutes of
making noise the mac hangs I would need to reboot it
What does this mean Do I need to buy more memory I have
 MB now I also have about  MB of disk free and the
scanned picture is about  MB

I'm considering adding a floptical drive to my current system

What I would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended for
their quality and performance

My preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both k and
k floppies but handling k floppies is not a necessity

So far I only know a bit about the Iomega floptical and the Infinity
floptical drives  Are there any commentsrecommendations for either of these

Are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and where
can they be purchased ie which mail order places etc

Thanks in advance

I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external
syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris
  I was going to do that with my  but had a couple of questions  My
PLI M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id switch on the
outside of the case  Where do I connect this switch  Can the computer just
tell with internal drives  
	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard I
didn't look closely but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's
soldered onto the motherboard  Would that cause problems
	One last question  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover  
the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case the
drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases  Should I just
cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place

Ans are welcomed  Thanks

 A while ago I posted a note asking for specs on the Quadra  and opinions on
 the Q upgrade of a IIci vs an accelerator card  So far no responsed that
 I've noticed  Please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade
 paths  Cost efficiency proscons etc Thanks
 
   Complete Q are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
 copy of MacWorld or MacUser  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
 comparison factors visavis a IIci are as follows
 
    MHz 
    Mhz data path don't recall this for sure but it's slower
       than Q  style machines for sure
   Ethertalk card onboard
   Audio inout
    MB RAM on motherboard
    SIMM slots
    NuBus slots
   More flexible buildin video than the CI  Uses VRAM
 
 In comparison a IIci with an accelerator won't give you
   audio or ethernet  or the same video options
   With a  accelerator CPU performance can be comparable but I
   think it ends up costing more
 
 Greg Dudek

  Actually an accelerator such as the Daystar  MHz  is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q  MHz  The accelerator costs about  whereas
the upgrade costs  just quoted from my dealer  However the Q
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 
with  bit depth and up to  at  bit depth with additional VRAM  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you you're
better off getting the Q upgrade otherwise save some money and get an
accelerator

Hi there


I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM I have tried to find info on this
but I could not get precise answers

On one hand we have a Quadra  with a  monitor which is capable of
bit color How much VRAM does it have
On the other hand we have a Quadra  with a  monitor which is capable
of bit color only so it must have  Ko of VRAM

I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the  and put them in the  so that
both machines have bit color capability
Is it possible and if yes how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 
From the documentation I have the Quadra  must get  Mo VRAM to have
bit color is that correct

Bonus question where do VRAM SIMMs hide From the  documentation they
seem to be behind the power supply Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs


Thanks for your help

Hi folks

I'm planning to buy a LCIII but need advice on choosing a monitor
What do people recommend for a decent  monitor  

I'v looked at some ads and the spec for NEC FGFGe and the price is 
within my budget but could LCIII be able to use the various resolutions 
available on FG specifically the x resolution Does LCIII only 
support one resolution

Also any recommendations for a reliable mail order place for LCIII or
monitors Does anyone have experience with the following mailorder places

	SYEX EXPRESS 	Houston Tx
	USA FLEX 	Bloomingdale Il

Thanks

Hi all
Thanks to you all who have responded
to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem
I'd like to ask a few more questions
  What are the advantages of buying a global village
Teleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra Zoom etc
  I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software
Why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems
of Supra  What kind of incompatibility is it
  If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold is there any
possibility to add a voice option in the near future
  Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer
this coming summer
  A person did mention a new ATT modem  Is it
getting good reviews from various Mac Magazines
  If I want the best fastest most economically sound and
possible voice option what fax modem should I buy

Sorry for posting so many questions but I think they're necessary
I promise to repost any answers if they're not already posted by a responder

Thanks so much in advance

Regards

Thian

I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx The machine is  years old
and I have been using the same hard drive internal Maxtor LXTS for
two and a half years The disk recently crashed I reformatted Silverlining
 but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing
The error message reported was like

Sector  Write error detected after testing good  sector not mapped out

This occurred randomly all over the hard disk which makes me suspect the
diagnostic's reference to Sector    On the third reformat and after
reinstalling the SCSI readwrite loops I was able to get through passes
 and  with no errors Pass  for some reason reported a lot of errors
but still mapped out no sectors I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall
System  and reload my data from a backup This proceded normally however
I now have suboptimal performance Symptoms include

   o Frequent crashes
   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to
       correct
   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot
        If I boot from Norton Utl after this occurs it cannot find the
         disk either
        The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power It sometimes
         requires several attempts

QUESTIONS

    Has anyone had this type of problem before
    Is the problem with the fx motherboard And its nonstandard
      SCSI implementation or with my Maxtor Disk Is there some
      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination
    Is it a termination problem I currently have external Syquest
      and an external DataFrame XP on the chain The XP is at the
      end and has internal termination so I am not using the IIfx
      terminator I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal
      drive I have run with this exact steup for   years with
      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat about a year ago
      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices
      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue Of
      course who knows 

Help would be much appreciated

    I would like to buy a  bit ADC card for the Mac II with digitization
 rate of at least  kHz preferably  kHz  I would prefer one with 
 good differential and integral linearity and DMA would be a plus  Other
 than National Instruments do you know of any other vendor who sells such
 a card
 
 Instrutech Corp has a nice looking  bit AD and DA board that can run
 at the speeds you want The ITC  doesn't have DMA but it does have
 a good sized FIFO that can buffer your samples Instrutech can be reached
 at   or  FAX
 

I don't know about the Instrutech boards though I plan to check them out
but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and SN ratio of
many of the  bit boards out there The NI boards are very clearly
specified in terms of monotonicity SN ratio accuracy etc and the
NBA and NBA have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
distortion that you'd expect from a good true  bit converter This is
not true for the Spectral Innovations boards for example

  I just got a Duo  and I'm having some difficulties
If the machine is plugged in to the wall adapter put to sleep
unplugged from the wall and woken up it crashes  of the time
There's nothing but the original system software on the machine

The battery has plenty of life  I think this must be a power manager
problem but I don't know what to do about it

Also the speaker occasionally makes a highpitched hiss  The noise
is irregular but seems to favor sleep and restart commands

I've had my Duo  for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems  thinking they were
system software problems Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen  it freezes

I also get the highpitched hiss occasionally  but only at
startup

I've called the apple hotline  SOSAPPL three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep This problem only occured
twice Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't
afford to be without my Duo at this time

Anyone out there with these same problems

please  

I think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive
on its side  The point is this will only be sure to work on the 'new'

  Hi I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor
  I heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip

  Thanks

 Well I also have an LC III  Popping the top revealed
 
 	One socket for an additional VRAM SIMM
 
 	One socket for a pin RAM SIMM
 
 	One socket for a flatpack FPU
 
 	A processordirect slot PDS identical to the LCLC II but with
 	an additional set of connetions to one side for the full bit
 	data path that the LCLC II lacked
 
 That's it  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
 in the PDS but that's the only place
 
So will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade or will it 
require a logic board swap It would be interesting for Apple to come out with
a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's x like RocketShare But I 
guess that's getting a bit fantastic

I was wondering since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' with
PowerPCs on a NuBus card

Also any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed Last I heard the 
estimates were around  times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode I
heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines
at a much earlier date that Q  but I doubt it's true

Finally is the PowerPC developer's CD 'minicourse' available I saw it 
advertised in the developer's university calendar and I'd like to know if it's
at all interesting

 Xposted to compsysmachardware and miscconsumers 

You've heard about Apple's great new customer support program  Well
think again  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple
computer users can give to each other  For another example read on

In the March th issue of MacWeek Ric Ford described a twoyear effort
by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with
certain defective mice  At random the switches on these mice stick in
the down position until clicked a second time apparently regardless of the
machine they are used with or the system software involved Most of the
reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of
BCGA You'll recognize this sticky button symptom immediately if you
have such a mouse the problem is intermittent but it's not subtle

Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem and instead 
suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly
MacWeek  p  When I called Apple on March rd and described
my defective mouse I was eventually given a case number FY and told
Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of
warranty  After waiting for three weeks I called back today wondering
where my new mouse was This time I was told that Apple had decided the
serial number on my mouse MBFC is not within the undisclosed
range Apple is willing to replace and there is nothing I can do about it

Nothing that is unless enough people complain about this problem to make
it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice
Please if you have one of these mice I NEED YOUR HELP Don't assume you
know what causes the problem there are lots of theories and start
hacking around inside your hundreddollar mouse Instead let Apple do it
Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at

                  United States      
                  Canada             
                  UK and Europe      
                  Australia          
                  Japan and Pacific  

If the number isn't tollfree call collect  Describe the problem and ask
for a replacement mouse  Even if they refuse insist that they register
the details of your case including your mouse's serial number  Be firm

Network managers and usergroup leaders especially please query your user
bases Everyone ask your friends and colleagues  Please don't send mail to
me or post yet another stickybutton report CALL APPLE DIRECTLY  If
enough victims take the trouble to report this wellknown problem Apple
will eventually be forced to respond  If Apple continues to find it easy
to stonewall on this issue don't expect them to offer support when the
next potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered

Hello all

For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync D
predecessor of FG to work properly with the internal video of Mac
IIvi

With a VGAadapter as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra
video it works only some minor interferences occur small enough not
to prevent any action on screen to be visible  clear

But because the scanrates  stuff of D are well enough for emulating
Apple  RGB I first made an adapter then got one fron the local
distributor of NEC
With both adapters I can get a picure which looks excellent most of
the time or every now and then
But with radical changes on screen opening palettes large windows
etc there are major interferences in sync The picture either tilts
sideways or scrables up totally Even when it is clear there are some
spiky interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing
pulldowns etc
With the selfmade adapter almost identical to the VGA one only
sense pins differ it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a
picture clear enough to shut down from menu
With the adapter from NEC everything is well most of the time but
sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely
lost But not nearly as often as with the selfmade one

I know with self made adapters there can always be interference but
with the one provided by NEC where's the source of this interference

I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess and I hope that you can
at least someone please try  figure out what could be the best pin
assignment for NEC D
I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and
isolations as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be
arranged especially syncs and groundings

Yes I have checked that the monitor is not defective it works
perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to x pixels and
also Atari Hz monochrome which I am using now with it

Here are the pinouts  stuff

Keywords Mac IIcx internal hard disk drive SCSI

Yes it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally This
is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra  The power supply is still the
stock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives a PLI SCSI 
accelerator a Micron technologies  bit video board Daystar QuickCache
New Technologies Overdrive and  meg of RAM simultaneously

I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive
tower The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto
which I added an extra connector about midway The final HD was internally
terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems
occur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two
internal hard drives

It works very well for me but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same

I have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the  mhz clock and a higher
speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different
 speeds There was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but
if the SI uses timing loops anything like a Quadra for accessing its floppy
drive dynamic switching will wreak havoc A Quadra must reboot after having its
clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its
floppy drive

Can someone please help me understand the current situation
regarding SIMMS

I have a IIsi which I will probably keep for another  years

I would like to add more memory ie go from  MB to  MB

I know that I will need  x MB ns or faster SIMMS

Which SIMMS  pin or  pin
Would the SIMMS I get today be usable in  years with a 
newer more powerful system

Any insight would be appreciated

 When the computer is set for  colors and certain operations are done
 particularly vertical scrolling through a window horizontal white lines
 appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open
 windows  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued  If a
 window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
 the line disappear from that area of the screen  This problem is not
 observed if the monitor is configured for  colors or a  inch Apple
 monitor with  colors is used 
 
 I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain  The problem has
 been apparent since day  but has gotten worse

I'm having exactly the same problem  Again it's fine when I switch to 
colors or a smaller monitor  My configuration is

Model Centris  with  MB HD  VRAM no cards
Monitor MAG MXF with  monitor adaptor for resolution of 

I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a

My guess is bad VRAMs as well  I really hope it isn't a design flaw  Is
anyone at Apple listening

Yup  That's why I'm kinda curious most SCSI problems I've encountered

a modem in or have to settle with  baud

You're not going to like this but if memory serves me postings
I've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are
no repeat no internal modems for the Duo besides the Express
Modem at any speed  Something having to do with the modem
using the main CPU for some of its tasks and Apple not releasing
details on the architecture or something  I'm vague on the
details but the gist was that there are going to be no
thirdparty internal Duo modems  If I'm wrong somebody please
correct me on this  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news

Hello fellow humans and other net creatures
 
If you're at all interested in this merchandise please email me

I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system so I have
two monitors and cards for sale Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces
I'm just wanting to conserve desk space and get all of my info from one
screen
 
I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas within
driving distance  like an hour away perhaps but I CAN ship to you if you
don't live near here Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes
for the monitors but I'm confident that my few months of fulltime service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction
 
Details
 
Mirror Full Page Display monochrome wnubus card

 
SOLD
 
Sony   color monitor

What's to say It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report It's a SONY
Trinitron arguably the best but I'd rather not argue that point
It's a great monitor in great shape but I'm going to a bigger screen
and although I'd like to keep it finances don't justify it
 
Still selling for  at MacLand where I bought it originally  not
including shipping will sell for  plus shipping Again make an
offer if that sounds unreasonable
 
 
RasterOps si bit accelerated hardware zoompan  meg RAM

Renamed the sx a few months after I bought it this board is for 
monitors providing accelerated bit hardware zoompan NTSC mode
you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC and  RAM slots that use  meg or  meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM or a
RAM disk Software included for such functions  meg of RAM included  meg
SIMMS
 
Selling for  at Bottom Line without the RAM  add  I'm asking
 shipping included this time it's just a card Original box and
packaging I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card
together so if you want both drop me email and make a bundled offer
for these items

HP printers are THE standard amongst printer manufacturers

PS My personnal favorite budgetwise would be the IIIP

The IIIP has just been superseded by the M which is the one I am using at
work  The quality of the print is execellent beating  dpi printers hands
down  In Australia the price of the M is about comparable with that of the

The Duo Powerbooks seem to park the heads after a few seconds of
inactivity is that builtin into the drive logic or is it being
programmed via software any way to tune the iddle timeout that
makes the heads park themselves I think the heads are being
parked since after a few seconds of inactivity you can hear the
clunk of heads parking

According to the official documentation failure to use the IIfx terminator
can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus
Whether this is your problem or not I don't know I have had sporadic SCSI
problems with my IIfx since I bought it I cannot connect more than three
devices fourth one causes major problems

First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system
If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive If it formats fine
then I would try to format it on your system with no externals If this 
fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repairreplacement

Hope this helps

portables and they're selling for  LESS that the PB s What I
want to know is what are the differences between them All I know is
that the Portable is heavier but the PB doesn't have an internal
drive Here's what I NEED to know

Does the portable support Appletalknetwork connections
What's the CPU inside a Portable 
DOES THE PORTABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM 
What's the maximum memory capacity of the Portable Can you still get
	RAM meaning does it use special SIMMS
What kind of internal HD does it use
Does the Portable have a better screen

 My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
 such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot 

  The LC family of Macs can only
  use PDS cards They are not able to use NuBus

 Ah but why  Can some technicallyhip Macslinger tell us what the
 difference is between PDS and Nubus  

 Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a
 Nubus card cage  At least Marvin's friend has not been able to
 locate one and neither have I  What is the fundamental reason for
 this

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages I'm sure I've seen
them advertised occassionally but I think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx
so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother

Of course it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive

NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing I have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments so there
is no problem building an expansion box

The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface
with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work
together on the same computer PDS processor direct slot is just that
here are all the connections to the processor You can do anything with
this and it is as quick as it can be but there's no cooperation You
may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 
video cards in and just watch them conflict Of course the extra 
electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive so
guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines

So yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice

I've just installed a  tape backup in my C lot of the issues
are the same  So to answer your questions

In article Aprcstpumkcedu kmoffattcstpumkcedu writes

 My PLI M syquest drive has a wire from the
 drive to an id switch on the outside of the case  Where do I connect
 this switch  Can the computer just tell with internal drives

You probably want to hardwire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers  Put
it at a convenient number like   You could cut a hole in the
back of the machine to route the ID switch but why go through the
hassle  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of
your internal drive

	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard I
didn't look closely but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's
soldered onto the motherboard  Would that cause problems

Yeah when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned
too  But it's no problem the device is designed to fit just fine
with the overhang  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROMRAMVRAM
SIMMs though

	One last question  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover  
the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case the
drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases  Should I just
cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place

You can specialorder parts to mount the device from your local Apple
dealer  The relevant parts are

    blank bezel faceplate
    CDROM carrier ie generic  device mounting bracket

Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slidein bracket to
mount a  device  The service techs I talked to said Oh sure
we stock those  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to
hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive

As far as I can tell Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already
cut out for a standard  device  Why not  They advertise
these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the
 bay why not provide the faceplate   They do sell a cutout for
their CDROM drive of course but that's of no use

I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my
tape drive which is a standard  device

Good luck with your SyQuest

	Fred

  Hi what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have if
  they want to go at least  baud

  Every place in town says they are back ordered and part of the reason
  I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from
  wherever I am but I really would hate to have to wait  months to get
  a modem in or have to settle with  baud

If Apple didn't put out such a good product  I'd gladly take my
business to  to  the bit Ataris  I think the
situation with the Express modem is inexusable for any business
I've had mine on order since January  Apple finally called me last
week  to tell me that I should have it by the second week of May
In the meantime I've been stuck with my Duo without the
connectability I needed it for  I'm sure there are plenty of people
who can bite back at me citing all sorts of reasons why Apple is
right or at least justified but I'm just a crabby consumer and
when I order a Duo with modem that's the product I expect

Oh well  It's not like it's limited to the computer biz  Remember
when the Miata came out  What about those Cabbage Patch Dolls  Well
I want my toy

A week or so ago I posted about a problem with my SE  I have  megs
or true RAM yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory
total of all extensions then my system will crash before the finder
comes up  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load or
sounds or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's
memory control panel  Apple's cache is at K mode  is on and
so is  bit addressing  All extensions work by themselves or with the
others until I increase the memory used by some of them with methods
mentioned above

Well here's my latest followup  I ran NOWs System Profile and got
this information

 Memory info 

Physical RAM size K
Logical RAM size K
Size of Low Memory Area K
Virtual Memory Inactive
Addressing mode bit mode in use
 bit System zone Absent
Parity RAM Not capable
Growable System Heap True
Temporary memory support Present
Tempory Memory Support Real and tracked

Note that  bit System zone is absent  Could this be the problem
How can I turn this on  Any ideas

Can anyone help

  ku In Hong Kong  you can buy a cheap PC  or  based computer
  ku However it is very experience to buy a Macintosh Last winter I was
  ku back to Hong Kong I saw the price of Mac Classic in Hong kong is same
  ku price to buy a LC in the US
  ku 
  ku I am not recommended to buy MAc in Hong Kong since Mac is not popular

Hello Mr Au

I have to disagree regarding your assessment of Macintosh in Hong Kong The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market as in the US A local magazine Next Magazine similar to Newsweek here uses the Mac extensively I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Macbased systems True the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin


e At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor On the other hand you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days illegal clones of the Apple IIe

Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac

Similarly you cannot say Lotus  surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus  can be bought for  and  for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals

Specs for the  can fill a  page book  Some highlights are
bit address space w bit data width   bit integer registers 
  bit floating point registers  K copyback capable caches
way set associative  Typical  clocksinteger instruction  
clocks for a floating point multiply

interesting aside the  can multiply two bit floating point
numbers in less time than it can multiply two bit integers

 Specs for the  with estimated cost release date etc

More of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching  Figure
about  clocks per instruction typical my guess  But the Motorola
guys are pretty bright it may be less

I'm interested in speeds systems it can run Windows NT RISC or whatever
costs bus info register info  All the technical info

Call Motorola  I'm not typing it all in

I am hoping that the  can win yet another battle against the intel people

I'm predicting that both the x and x lines are reaching their
ends  New experimental processors have bit data pathways and can
schedule up to  out of  instructions each clock cycle  That sort
of trick can't really be done with CISC architectures

I finally saw some details on the Pentium and was not greatly
impressed  They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to
speed but otherwise it's only going to be a x speedup  And to get
that they're using two integer units larger caches and a branch
target buffer  Yes I know they're talking about MHz processors
Big whoop  Designing a MHz board is difficult and really
expensive  Priced ns memory chips lately

 My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is

  The LC family of Macs can only

 Ah but why  Can some technicallyhip Macslinger tell us what the
 difference is between PDS and Nubus  

 Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a
 Nubus card cage  At least Marvin's friend has not been able to
 locate one and neither have I  What is the fundamental reason for
 this

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages I'm sure I've seen
them advertised occassionally but I think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx
so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother

Of course it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive

NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing I have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments so there
is no problem building an expansion box

Apple uses the IEEE Nubus standard for their  bit backplane bus
I got this from a technote that I reada couple of weeks ago

Their screens blank out sometimes after a minor physical jolt
such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive sometimes 
all by themselves computer left to itself just goes blank

I have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the 
video board because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires
made the screen come back on  This worked for a while but the
blanking out has returned

Can I do anything  Do I need a new power supply  A new CRT

Anyone know what would cause my IIcx to not turn on when I hit the keyboard
switch  The one in the back of the machine doesn't work either
The only way I can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes
then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately
Sometimes this doesn't even work for a long time

I remember hearing about this problem a long time ago and that a logic 
board failure was mentioned as the source of the problemis this true

I recently got a ZyXEL UE modem  It's great but I'm still having
some problems figuring out what strings to use in what applications
I basically need strings for Zterm FirstClass client and Telefinder
client  I've been able to get FirstClass and Zterm working by using 
another modem's settings in FirstClass and copying them for Zterm
However it still has problems  Zterm for example will list 'ERROR'
the first time I try dialing after starting the problem  If I cancel and
try again it works fine  Telefinder is even worse  I can't get it to
even wake up the modem  So if anyone uses a ZyXEL for any of these
programs I'd greatly appreciate you sending me the setup strings you use
Thanks in advance

RSMITHPEARLTUFTSEDU Rod Smith writes
I can't help you with FirstClass or Telefinder but I've been using ZTerm
and a
ZyXEL for close to two weeks now  Here's what I did

Once in ZTerm set hardware handshaking on and the bps rate to 
You've
probably already done this  Then I typed

atd
atw

The first line sets the modem to ignore the DTR line necessary for
hardware
handshaking with most though not all Mac hardware handshaking cables
The
second stores this setting in nonvolatile memory in the modem so it's the
default when the modem starts  In the modem preferences dialog I have the
modem initialization string set to atzM which just insures that the
stored setting is used useful if starting ZTerm after using something like
the
fax software or MacWoof which change the settings in other ways 
Alternatively you could leave the factory default the way it is and just
set
the ZTerm initialization string to atdM which would accomplish the
same
thing IF the modem is always on before you start ZTerm and IF other
programs
don't modify the settings  Or atzdM would work even if other
programs
modify the modem's settings  I do it the way I do because I sometimes
forget
to turn on the modem before launching ZTerm and this way I'm assured of
having
the correct DTR handling when the modem's powered up
 
After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide I
came up with
ATZLNXDSM
This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm
Quick summary of each commmand
Z	 Reset modem to User Profile 
L	 Speaker volume at  fairly quiet
N	 Ring volume at  fairly quiet
X	 Display connect info according to setting  see manual
D	 Assume DTR computer is always on
S	 Dial speed at  as fast as ZyXEL can handle

In FirstClass I used this same string with the addition of S right
before the S command in the setup box  This disables the autoanswer 
function of the modem for FirstClass  I based my modem setting on the Supra
FAX and just changed the above mentioned string

In Telefinder I based my setting on the Zoom V  HH setting  I changed
the 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass and
everything seems to work fine

Sorry it took so long to get this summary out  If someone wants to forward
this to the infomacreports directory at sumexaim it might save other
newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings and
also save the net some redundant messages  If anyone else has something
to add feel free

Hi everyone Just the other day I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from
Mac Connection They sent it overnight very nice and I got it installed
and we found that it didn't work properly When you put the computer in 
thousands mode the bottom of the screen using the new chip is all flickering
and fuzzy So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one

My question is how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general
Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad Is this
a rarity This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experience
in this area I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of
experience

That's about it Please email me and if people want I can post a summary

Here is the story
I have a network with  Macs on Localtalk One of them has an
Ethernet Card and is currently connected to a NeXT don't laugh
I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi The NeXT is connected
to the internet over SLIP running on a  baud modem

Currently we can telnet from the Mac w Ethernet to the NeXT
and then telnet out again to the rest of the world

What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT
via the Ethernet Mac From what we have heard AIR doesn't do
the trick

Software solutions would be good too but my impression is that
there aren't going to be any

Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet
out again The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers
to machines so everyone shares that  numberoh well

thanks in advance

	Hello

	I remember running across an ad in the back of MacUserWorld
a few years ago for a Nubus board that had umpteen SIMM slots to be
used to recycle your old SIMMs when you upgraded memory  I don't
remember who made this board and I haven't seen it advertised in
any of the latest Mac magazines  It mentioned that it included software
to make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk As someone who has SIMMS 
he can't get rid ofuse but hates the waste this sounds to me like a majorly
good idea  Does anyone out there know what boardcompany I'm talking about  
Are they still in business or does anyone know where I can get a used one
if they are no longer made  Any help would be greatly appreciated  Please
email me to save netbandwidth

Readers

I have found that the cache upgrade options for the Mac IIsi include the
following	 AE QuickSilver
		 Daystar Fastcache IIsi
		 Daystar ComboCache IIsi
		 LogiCache IIsi k cache

I'd be interested in hearing opinions on any or all of these options
The other alternative is to upgrade to a CPU accelerator such as the
LogiCache  MHz Ideas comparisions

If you get teh IIvx C upgrade does it include a new sticker to

I can't say for sure with the IIvx  C upgrade but I wondered the
same thing when I ordered my LC  LC III upgrade  Turns out the upgrade
is actually an entire CPU minus any disk drives  You pull the floppy and
hard drives out of the old one stick them in the new one and you've got
an LC III

The IIvx  C may be the same thing

It might be something to look into for those people who are unhappy that
Apple only sells Macs prepackaged with the drives  Of course the price
is quite a bit higher without the tradein

Hi there

Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for
C regarding fpu  In all Mac price lists I've seen every C
has the message fpu optional  I know from what we've discussed in this
newsgroup that all C have the fpu built in except the 
configuration  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list
I'm planning to buy the C cd pretty soon but I'm now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not
Why say optional if it's built in
Please anybody help me understand this game

Anyone out there have a Sony S

I have one and it's very nice however  If I run it in  mode the
picture won't
go very big I end up with about  gap either side and  top 
bottom I suspect
an internal adjustment would fix this Anyone tried it

Another problem is subbrightness Areas that are meant to be black or
off the main
raster are not very black The real raster is quite visible when the
screen is blanked
This is not too severe but it is just not as good as other Trini screens
I have
used If I turn the brightnesscontrast down so that the raster is not
visible the
real image virtually disappears

The raster size is just right if I use  but dpi is a bit too
much

Oh and I am using a RasterOps XLi card

Hi all
Thanks to you all who have responded
to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem
I'd like to ask a few more questions
  What are the advantages of buying a global village
Teleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra Zoom etc
  I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software
Why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems
of Supra  What kind of incompatibility is it
  If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold is there any
possibility to add a voice option in the near future
  Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer
this coming summer
  A person did mention a new ATT modem  Is it
getting good reviews from various Mac Magazines
  If I want the best fastest most economically sound and
possible voice option what fax modem should I buy

Sorry for posting so many questions but I think they're necessary
I promise to repost any answers if they're not already posted by a responder

Thanks so much in advance

Well Bill There are MB soldered on the logic board and MB in the RAM

giving you a total of MB which is the max on a You can try calling

A professor of mine once said The difference between a Computer Engineer and
a Computer Scientist is about  meaning the Engineer makes  more than
the CS
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use ie database graphics word processors etc while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems ie the computer in your
car a flight control system computer controled devices etc In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE 
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is

PS The  is not just a joke
Scott

For the most part this is a bunch of bunk  I've got a Computer Engineering
degree yet I've spent the last  years writing software that people actually
use  Moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect I received  job offers
upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were
year lower  My advice is to decide which classes and projects most
interest you and pick the major that allows you to take them

 I don't know about the Instrutech boards though I plan to check them out

 NBA and NBA have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
 distortion that you'd expect from a good true  bit converter This is
 not true for the Spectral Innovations boards for example

To boorishly reply to myself I found I did have the Instrutech information
already The specs to use the term loosely are as follows

AD  bit converter with  bit accuracy to  kHz  bit accuracy to
 kHz No specs for SN monotonicity linearity There are  multiplexed
inputs sharing the single AD so that all inputs are not samples at the
same time and in the above conversion specs the allchannel sample rate
must be used Thus for two channels you only have  unknown quality bits
at  kHz per channel This is poorer quality than the national
Instruments at the same sample rate

DA  bit converter No specs for SN monotonicity linearity Each of
the  output channels has its own converter

The price for the external converter box the ITC the NuBus interface

steep

	I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general  The
processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the
computer is used in its designed purpose  Comparing processor speed is
pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed
to increase speed among other things

	I mean how can you say a  is faster than a  without 
giving is operational conditions  Can you say the same when 
you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions
Knowing that  does not have transidental functions building in to 
its FPU and  does can you say that  is still faster

	Anyway I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers
is good or not solely on its processor  Or how fast a processor is
based on its name because one can alway do a certain things to a
processor to speed it up  

	But if we restrict our arguements to for example pure
processor architectural issues  Or how one processor will work
well and another will not based on its design then we can get
somewhere with our discussions

And about clock speed  Does doubling the clock speed double the

No  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processorclock speed
Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and
IO speed  As processor clock rates go up the speed of the memory
system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed  If
you have a MHz processor it can be reading another word from memory
every ns  Sure you can put all ns memory in your computer but
it will cost  times as much as the slower ns SIMMs

Not in a clockdoubled system There isn't a doubling in performance but
it is quite significant Maybe about a  increase in performance

Besides for  wait state performance you'd need a cache anyway I mean
who uses a processor that runs at the speed of ns SIMMs Note that this
memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of  MHz

And roughly the  is twice as fast at a given clock
speed as is the

For the most part this is a bunch of bunk  I've got a Computer Engineering
degree yet I've spent the last  years writing software that people actually
use  Moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect I received  job offers
upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were
year lower  My advice is to decide which classes and projects most
interest you and pick the major that allows you to take them

emt

	Well here is my  worth  Advice from a grad student

	I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me
The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and 
learn as much as possible about it  

	In my five years of education in this field though brief 
compare to alot of people I had to think about this kind of 
question a lot  Did I make the right decision in going into
Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or
CS  The more I go thru school the more I believe that this
kind of question is irrelevant  
 
	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one 
does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does
not like to program is really doing an injustice of building
and computer and making it useful for something  Everything
is interwoven and inseparable  CS CE and EE are all a 
part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other

	My advice is don't limit yourself but make a decision
based on which major will give you the best opportunities to 
learn  That of course depends on the curriculum at your 
persective school  I would choose a major that allows me to
explore as much as possible  Beside I don't know why the
school would make a student choose a major before herhis
sophamore year                  

	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you 
decided to learn all about the making of computers in which 
case you suffer a little more and go to grad school

	About the money  Don't look at the averages if you
are good you are going to earn more money than anyone else 
If you are a superstar programmer you will earn millions  
Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers

Summary Instructions for Quadra  memory installation
Keywords memoryquadrainstall

This is turning into a FAQ


Here is how to violate your Quadra  warranty and install your own
memory

  Insert usual disclaimer here
 
  Remove the top lid of the machine You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower Follow the usual antistatic
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back
	of the mac
 
  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply Leave that alone The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release
 
  Look at the rear of the tower assembly You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive Disconnect all these from the motherboard
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it
                                            
  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

  Look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower A
    phillips head screw is at the base Remove it taking care not to drop
    it into the case A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here

  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly Slide the entire tower assembly  cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case

  Congratulations you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM
    slots

  The six big slots are for VRAM One usually must install all six to
    gain useful video modes All SIMMS RAM or VRAM  installed with their
	chips facing the front of the motherboard
	
    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS Install SIMMS in
	sets of four into these sockets Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely
	and firmly into a fully upright position
	
 Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	 cm posterior of its intended position Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case
    Once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place
	
 Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE

 Replace the phillips head screw

 Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in

 Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount

  I just got a Duo  and I'm having some difficulties
If the machine is plugged in to the wall adapter put to sleep
unplugged from the wall and woken up it crashes  of the time
There's nothing but the original system software on the machine
The battery has plenty of life  I think this must be a power manager
problem but I don't know what to do about it
Also the speaker occasionally makes a highpitched hiss  The noise
is irregular but seems to favor sleep and restart commands

I've had my Duo  for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems  thinking they were
system software problems Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen  it freezes

I also get the highpitched hiss occasionally  but only at
startup

I've called the apple hotline  SOSAPPL three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep This problem only occured
twice Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't
afford to be without my Duo at this time

Anyone out there with these same problems

Yes quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had me
included I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and
started to experience these problems

Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of
potential causes  Faulty applications faulty third party hardware
modems memory etc system software PRAM corruption and power
manager corruption and the Duo hardware itself

None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe
no applications were running the system software was reinstalled I
have no additional hardware I have found that clearing PRAM appears
to help for a while at least hold down command option P and R on
startup Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is
being corrupted by something system software bug   I don't have any
nonissue inits in my system Apparently the Power Manager can be
reset by holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up 
Apple's advice  but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button
I'm not sure what they mean in this case This may also help if
someone can decipher Apple's advice for me

Beyond this Apple suggest that  you should follow the technical
procedures to check the hardware of this Duo Since so many others
appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there
has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line 
and quite recently too  since it only seems to be recent Duo 
purchasers who have this problem

Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome
particularly Apple Duo engineers 

cheers

As far as the DX goes   SPECint  SPECfp 

But the  is or will soon be available in  MHz version
making it comparable to a DX

Intel chips have traditionally been faster than their Motorola equivalents
although the significance of chip speed in real world application performance
is something that is highly debatable

I think you have that one turned around they have faster clock
cycles but less power behind each cycle Not to mention that the
Intel instruction stream is BYTEoriented longest Intel instruction
is  bytes what an odd number  which makes it hard to do any

Summary  box with NEXTSTEP


First of all  Thank you everyone who replied  As you can well
imagine I got nearly one hundred responses so I figured I'd thank
you all here instead of individually

The tallies

I got one vote for AUX which runs on the Macintosh

I got several nays for Commodore's UX system

Most people agreed that SGI's were nice and very very expensive

Some devoted Sun users nearly insisted that I try to find a used
Sun say a  or 

About a dozen people told me how they love their NeXTonly now NeXT
is out of the hardware business see below

And most of the other  people said  Get a  box and run some
version of Unix that's available either in the Public Domain or
commercially



And so I weighed my options  What stood out in my opinion was that
there were several different versions of Unix available on one system
the  PC architecture  If I bought a Sun I'd have to use SunOS
If I bought a used NeXT I'd have to use NeXTSTEP see below  Ad
nauseum

But with a PC I can run Linux which is a small userfriendly 
flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume although I
hear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with bsd another
PD free port which takes up a lot more space  I can purchase
BSD commercial product if I choose  There are several other
commercial packages available

So what I've found out after pricing systems etc is that I can
get a really good Unix workstation for as little as   Including
source code

Or for  I can get an unbelievable EISA bus DX
system fully blown and run single user BSD

What I'm really excited about though is NEXTSTEP for Intel  NeXT
changed into a software company only and they are releasing their OS
for PC's  I've used NeXT's before and I absolutely loved them
Everyone who wrote me about NeXT or NEXTSTEP commented on the
developer's environment and how well designed the whole package is



So my choice is to

  Wait for the mail on Monday so I can read what NEXTSTEP's system
requirements are

  If I'm wowed on what they say I'll buy a system that fits into
their criteria

    a  Get NEXTSTEP

  If I'm wowed but I can't afford it yet most likely I'll buy a
system that fits their criteria

    a  Get Linux or bsd as a temporary learning experience so I
can save up for NEXTSTEP

  If I'm not sufficiently wowed least likely I'll buy a system
that is slightly less blown out like a DX  ISA and put Linux
or bsd on it



Again thanks to everyone around the net

I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old  year Asante ENSC
adapter The BaseT connection works like a charm I installed the
newest drivers from Asante's ftp server

The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain 
specifically a MB drive I power up the drive then the Mac The Mac
tests memory etc Just before the happy Mac face normally shows up the
power light on the ENSC goes out and the boot process stops So I can use
the network or the external drive but not both at once This makes the
Asante box pretty much unusable

It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem because if I turn
on the drive just a second or so too late so that it doesn't get noticed
during the initial SCSI polling the Mac boots normally and the adapter
works even though the hard disk is powered on and connected The Mac has
never once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now and I've had
it for over a year

Here is what I tried changing the SCSI ID's of the ENSC and the disk 
several permutations changing the order of devices ie the ENSC at the
head or tail of the chain overterminating with an external terminator
both devices have internal ones underterminating ie removing internal
resistors from the hard disk trying another ENSC box trying another
identical drive trying several different SCSI cables

Has anybody seen this More importantly does anyone have a solution
Thanks a lot    E

Hi

The subject line says it all  My system acts weird at times  All of a
sudden the system will be corrupt boot blocks will get chewed etc

This was a really big problem for a while  I couldn't even format my
drive properly  I installed HDT's driver and things got better  Now
all I have to do is reinstall the system  Could an incompatibility 
exist between it and a Quantum external drive

I'm looking for a pure hardware solution  It's not a virus bad
software etc  Could I have a bad SCSI cable  Or is the IBM WDS
just a screwey drive

Thanks

The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use ns SIMMs in
a MHz machine but that you could use ns SIMMs in slower machines I just
pointed out that if you could only use ns SIMMs in a MHz machine you can't
use ns SIMMs in anything faster than a  MHz machine Bank switching and
caches were not considered in either example although both would help memory
access

Hi there

Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for
C regarding fpu  In all Mac price lists I've seen every C
has the message fpu optional  I know from what we've discussed in this
newsgroup that all C have the fpu built in except the 
configuration  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list
I'm planning to buy the C cd pretty soon but I'm now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not
Why say optional if it's built in
Please anybody help me understand this game

Regards

Thian

If you get the Centris  with CD configuration you are getting a Mac with
a RC processor that has builtin math coprocessor support  My 
understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing
the Centris   without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU

Apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonFPU system to become an FPU
system  And it is unclear whether the ' processor on the nonFPU system
a LC can be replaced with a RC supplied by another vendor
Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris  which ONLY
comes with a nonFPU LC processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU 
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another again according to Apple's memo

Hope that helps

Dear Netters

My sister has an Apple  Color Display hooked up to an LC

Problem  There is an annoying horizontal ghostlike stripe that 
precesses vertically about once per second  It is about  cm high
She is in grave danger of going insane because of it

Any ideas of what it might be and how I might cure it for her

Joe Betts
bettsnetcomcom

PS if I pick up the display I thought it might be RFI from the LC it 
seems to get worse


This can be caused by two one of two things  The first and easiest to fix is
interference from something around the monitor such as another monitor or
other electrical device  Try moving the system to another location to fix
that problem

Second because of the scan rate of the monitor it tends to synchronize with
room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing  Try turning off
all lights in the rooms around the system and see if that helps  If not
try moving the system somewhere else

A third solution would be to get a  Apple Color Display  It should not
have the same problem the  Color is more suceptible to

You can try calling Apple's new support number in the US at SOSAPPLE
This number is for ANYONE who has questions regarding Macintosh setup and
compatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on Monday
April  

Good luck

If such a device exists are there are any limits to the number of

How many NuBus slots do you have

Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink which is
a card with  serial ports that you get at through the comms
toolbox in addition to the builtin ones It also comes with
software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they
think they open a builtin port

They also have a more expensive card with DMA better performance
and I think they or someone else have a card that handles
 ports simultaneously

As I said with NuBus you're green Learn how to use the Comms
Resource Manager to get at the various installed cards

While I'm on the subject what's everybody's reccomendations for

of course there is always the reliable old Macintosh  display

   My mac monitor displays about  vertical lines when I use it
It means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad
or video card is bad
   I checked my monitor it works fine with other Mac
   I checked my video card it's also fine
   I replaced all the RAMs it still didn't give me right answer
   Hence I assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard

   I don't know hardware architecture of the Macintosh

   Can anyone tell me what's the problem 

   It's a Mac IIcx

Keywords sound stereo Quadra  PowerBook 


Hi  I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra
 but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem
on his PowerBook   Any info or experience anyopne has would be
greatly appreciated

When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system the following types
of sounds mono as far as I can tell all play fine through BOTH
speakers

system beeps  already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record

Armor Alley
Spectre
Spaceward Ho


But the following games only play out of the left channel

Lemmings
Out of This World  awesome game BTW
Glider 
OIDS


But still STEREO system beeps do play in stereo through BOTH speakers
The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning which
my roommate downloaded from some ftp site sumex


All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates  he can't run
OOTW because he doesn't have color

We're both running system 



Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get
sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class Quadra LC PowerBook  or
greater Centris SE etc stereo machine

I used to have a Mac II and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in
stereo on that machine not just on the left channel  I could be
mistaken though  If there were a problem with the Quad 's and PB
's I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo  If there
isn't a problem with our machines I wonder why the  games above are
apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they
could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of
both speakers  like Spectre etc do

Quadra 's and PowerBook 's have the same ROMS to my knowledge
so maybe this is a ROM problem  if so though why wouldn't System 
patch over this problem




Thanks for any help you can provide

 I have a very old Mac k and a Mac Plus both of which 
 have the same problem
 Their screens blank out sometimes after a minor physical jolt
 such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive sometimes 
 all by themselves computer left to itself just goes blank
 
 I have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the 
 video board because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires
 made the screen come back on  This worked for a while but the
 blanking out has returned
 
 Can I do anything  Do I need a new power supply  A new CRT
 A new computer

I had the same problem with my  a long time ago  Resoldering
the joints on the motherboard all of them fixed it  Turns out
that continuous heating and cooling caused annular ringshaped
cracks to develop in the solder effectively cutting the video
circuitry off  If you're not a solderjockey you might want to
have someone else do it  I took mine to an electrical engineer
buddy  but it was a minute job tops

Here is the MacWeek article describing the DUO ram situation

Bad RAM brings some Duos down random access memory boards for Apple
Macintosh PowerBook Duos 
MacWEEK v n Feb  

COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing LP 

By Raines Cohen

     Austin Texas  Some thirdparty memoryexpansion cards for PowerBook
Duos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes data loss
and other problems

     Technology Works Inc a RAM and network vendor based here last week
issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM
products from some competing vendors which it declined to identify
Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist

      Selfrefresh  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called
selfrefreshing which can recharge itself while the system sleeps  But
Technology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with
nonselfrefreshing DRAM which can cause the system to lose data or fail to
wake from sleep

     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part
number stamped on their selfrefreshing chips nonselfrefreshing chips
instead have an L according to TechWorks  The chip label however may
not tell the whole story  Newer Technology of Wichita Kan said it uses
nonselfrefreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed
while the Duo sleeps

      Speed  Some RAMcard vendors have put nanosecond DRAM on Duo
cards rather than the nanosecond type the  requires Technology
Works said  However some chips labeled as  or nanosecond are
certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed

     Kingston Technology Corp of Fountain Valley Calif said it offers
Duo RAM cards with nanosecond chips but only for the Duo  which is
compatible with the slower chips

      Space  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that
some thirdparty cards are too large to fit properly forcing the corner
of the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally
when in a Duo Dock

     Lifetime Memory Products Inc of Huntington Beach Calif said it
originally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all
customers free upgrades to cards that fit

Mac sound hardware is diverse some macs play in stereo and
mix the output the SE for instance while others play in
stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker while
some are truly mono like the LC

Developers know that stuff played in the left channel is
guaranteed to be heard while the right channel isn't Some
send data to both some only send data to the left channel
the first is preferrable of course

I'm a system and network admin One of my users has a Duo 
specifications below that has been having slowdown problems
Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down
unacceptably It can take  seconds to change applications During
this time it is completely hung  If he reboots the problem goes away
For a while It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged
configuration

He's reinstalled System  and rebuilt the desktop Neither of these
have helped 

It's possible that it's networkrelated he uses Eudora which checks his
email every  minutes over Ethernet He hasn't checked to see if this
problem occurs while undocked he's docked most of the time 

Little to no nonApple inits I don't want to start yanking the rest
unless I know that might really be the problem 

He hasn't tried zapping the PRAM I have advised him to do that next

Anyone who has ideas I'd love to hear about them I'd call Apple but
I've found they're best to call during the week it's Sunday evening

It's my understanding that when you format a magnetooptical disc  the
formatting software installs a driver on the disc  if you insert the
disc in a different drive then this driver is loaded into the computer's
memory and then controls the drive and  if this driver is incompatible
with the drive then the disc can not be mounted andor properly readwritten
Is that correct

My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is

Ah but why  Can some technicallyhip Macslinger tell us what the

Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a

Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at
least three Macs the SE IIsi and Centris  They have not to
my knowledge announced such a device for the LCII but they could
make one technologically

The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller
circuitry present on NuBus Macs

Why though does anyone care about this dgr has a threePDS
adapter for the LCLCII They will soon have one for the LCIII PDS
is better than NuBus for most people in most applications Granted
there are more NuBus cards But most applications that require a
NuBus card like fullmotion video capture shouldn't be done on an
LCLCIILCIII anyway

with colour quickdraw I was told this somewhere or other but it's
not mentioned in Apple Facts guide for apple sellers in the
press release or in the technical specs

Sean 

I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images loaded
with the proper software However the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on
its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM

So while you might be able to PRINT grayscale you'd have a hard time
SEEING the grayscale image you want to print

A friend asked me to build a cable to connect an HP fetal heart monitor
to a Maciontosh SE  No problem sez I


I wanted to demo it on my PB  it won't work

The PB has been used running ZTerm and kermit using both internal and external
modems so I don't think it's the powerbook per se

When I send a  to the HP it responds with AA  a test of the serial
ports  It works on the SE but not on the PB

I thought that the SE is connected to earth ground and so is the HP So I
connected from the chassis of the HP to the PW audio ground connector still
NG

Any thoughts

Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to 
serial port weirdness  I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP LX
handheld  Everything else worked okay on that port but not the HP it runs
on two penlite batteries  It turned out that the plus by accident or by 
design flaw was putting a  volt bias on the serial port that was doing 
weird things to the HP which has only v dc  The HP worked fine when 
connected to the printer port  

Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device  Have you 
tried using the printer port

Good luck

  Hi I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor
  I heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip
  Is this true I heard that the slot is not the same as the PDS
  slot  Is that true
 
  Thanks
  David Mirsky
  mirskygnuaimitedu

 Well I also have an LC III  Popping the top revealed

       One socket for an additional VRAM SIMM

       One socket for a pin RAM SIMM

       One socket for a flatpack FPU

       A processordirect slot PDS identical to the LCLC II but with
       an additional set of connetions to one side for the full bit
       data path that the LCLC II lacked

 That's it  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
 in the PDS but that's the only place

So will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade or will it
require a logic board swap It would be interesting for Apple to come out with
a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's x like RocketShare But I
guess that's getting a bit fantastic

I was wondering since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' with
PowerPCs on a NuBus card

Also any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed Last I heard the
estimates were around  times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode I
heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines
at a much earlier date that Q  but I doubt it's true

Finally is the PowerPC developer's CD 'minicourse' available I saw it
advertised in the developer's university calendar and I'd like to know if it's
at all interesting

Sean

seanmcdacdalca

Radius speculated publicly that they could provide a PowerPCbased
Rocket for existing Macs It would have the plus of RocketShare and
the minus of NuBus accelerators  no true boot off the accelerator
NuBus bottleneck to video and other IO

Apple it seems will not compete with third parties here  except
perhaps for notyetavailable Macs like Cyclone where a PowerPC
slot might be advertised Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC
accelerators

One potential problem with any accelerator though is that it will
need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius with
Rocketshare to use any of its proprietary code

Apple is between the lines trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs
will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC
and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in
existing  Macs Perhaps then we'll see groundbreaking
prices in Maclogic board upgrades much the same way we've seen
much cheaper highperformance CPUs this year

First generation PowerPCs s will also hopefully have socketed
CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to s a year later
This should be possible in much the same way that s can be pulled
for clock doublers If there is too much technical   baggage which
I doubt since the external busses are the same sizewidth to do
this perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard a la Powerbook as
standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades This is an area where
Apple has fallen far behing the Intelbased world Perhaps catchup
is in order

By the way last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC
Pentium MIPS R DEC Alpha the big four on the microprocessor
front for the forseeable future Worth reading for technojunkies
Also the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium Read it and all
the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent
right now

Once anyone is this secure they are due to fall Intel's market
position will never again be as dominant as it is today especially
if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its s this week as it appears it
might The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome
battle Apple users should be excited that PowerPC while not
guaranteed dominance is a guaranteed winner even if its one of
several

Is it possible ie via creative cable splicing or whatever to
hook a Syquest MB removable drive to a Mac

Is there any difference with the guts of the drive or is it
just cable differences

Thanks

Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBMPC and Mac
The two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself but with
the correct software each can read the others and maybe the cable
depends on your SCSI board on IBMPC

If you get some Mac softawre to allow mounting of ANY IBMformatted disk
and the correct cable you should br able to mount and read your IBMPC
syquest

Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the 
Powerbook  here are a couple of the answers
 Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk Yes
 What CPU is in the Mac Portable A low power version of the  
running at  Mhz
 Does the Mac Portable run system  Yes although it does use up a 
lot of memory
 Is memory still availabe for the Portable There are several vendors 
that still make RAM for the Portable There are two options Some vendors 
sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable Others sell 
memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot Either way the most 
memory you can address is either  or  megabytes depending on whether 
the Portable is Backlit or not King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine 
California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory MB  
  MB  and  MB  I still see several ads in macuser that 
are selling  MB modules for  Wide variety in pricing here
 What is the internal HD Its a Conner CP  MB HD with an 
average access time of about  ms
 Is the screen better that the PB  Heavens yes The PB  is a 
backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move 
your head a few degrees left or right The Portable has a backlit or 
nonbacklit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read

Other things to consider  Where to get the portable and how much to pay 
for it A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass They were willing to 
sell a MB Nonbacklit Portable with an internal  bps modem for about 
 Or a  MB Backlit Portable with an internal  bps modem for 
about  

The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much

I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable Anybody got 
one they want to sell  Good Luck Gene Wright

Some kind soul told me that I could change the serial port buffer size

Could he or any one else please tell me what to do

I assume that the relevant resource is zSet but I do not know and
I have no template for that resource If you have a TMPL for the correct
resource I would be grateful to receive it That way I could play around
a bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port
other than Appletalk

BTW I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is
 bytes that that means increasing the buffer will help if you are
using hardware handshaking I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo
and can monitor that CTS is being lowered but the buffer never gets beyond
 out of  bytes Makes sense to me

I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection
between a Mac Duo  and a PC I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on
the Mac side I have used Procomm Kermit and Softerm on OS on
the PC or PS side I have used nonHardware handshaking and hardware
ahdshaking cables And know MY hands are shaking from the effort Nothing
has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS

In general I can type back and forth with no trouble but only if both sides
are set to speeds OVER  baud I cannot send files from the Mac to the
PS at all and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible
When I do a straight ascii send I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly
I can send Binhex files this way quite fast and I know that the
transmission is error free
But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors
Unless of course I do text pacing so slow that it is like human
typing well like  times faster than human typing

I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files
from a Duo  to a PS via modem or null modem If you can do it please
tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software Obviously I am
talking of a true serial port modem not the express modem Maybe some
kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo  can check this out for me

Right now I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because
of the power interrupts on the Duo and it won't work at low speeds
because of some crazy reason I don't understand

Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information
out the serial port of a Duo  fast Like via a modem or via a
sysex dump

Could anyone with a Duo help me out I am going absolutely INSANE
I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo or all Duo s or all Duos
or just me

Yes I have checked the cable  times And not only can I type
back and forth but Zterm alerts the users if she uses hardware handshaking
and CTS is down So I know that hardware handshaking is working And also
According to Zterm port stats the buffer never overflows

Please help me figure out what's going on

DBIts a small box which has a bag inn it  seemingly
DBcontaining  chips look like ROMS and a IINTX manual
DBThe installation instructions are most informative and say in full
DBThis product must be installed by an Apple 

DBSO what does this do  At first I thought it might be a NT to NTX
DBupgrade but I thought that required an entirely new board

Sounds like you got the Adobe ROM upgrade for an NTX That describes
the kit I got when I upgraded to the  or  PostScript in my NTX

NSI am going to be getting a C soon but I dont want Apple
NSto come out with the Cyclones and the Tempest in a month
NSand have the price drop on the system I want  I have negotiated a
NSgood deal with a supplier for a C  and I would like to jump on it
NSbut again I don't want the price drop to smuther me  BTW the deal
NSI have is a C  with mouse for  does anyone know of a better
NSdeal

I don't know of a better deal but would you be willing to share your
deal with the rest of us That certainly sounds like you're getting a
great deal I'd be interested in that deal too

ECIt was called the Mac XL when Sculley came on board I bought one at
a closeout place after the Mac Plus and the awesome meg serial hard
drive were introduced To pacify people who bought the XL and only found
it was discontinued within a year Apple sent people like I a letter
saying for  and the XL they would give me a meg Mac Plus with
the HD

The Lisa was originally introduced in  or ' I forget now and
sold for  with  k floppy drives and Mb memory It didn't do
too well grin

Before becoming the Mac XL it was called a Lisa  It had a built in
meg HD by this time and was expandable to Mb RAM although that's not
what the  in  stood for It was the second coming of the Lisa It
also predated the Mac Plus AND the Mb serial HD by quite a few months
For a short while it WAS the power users system

Best I can figure it is due to time heat and repeated warmupcool downs in

I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video
in my IIci and to get  bit color capability on my  monitor What's
the deal on them

 Do they come with varying amounts of RAM If so what is the max
and min How much do I need for  x  x  bits

 What bit depths are supported One     and 

 Are all these cards accelerated or just some Is it true that
modern accelerated video cards are at least in general faster What
bit depths are accelerated all or just  bit I've heard that some
applications actually run slower with this card if they write directly
to the screen or something like that Is this a frequent problem
How much slower is it

 Didn't I read when System  first came out that the card was
incompatible If so how was this corrected Finder patch some INIT
or other Has it been kept compatible with  Are there many other
apps that it is incompatible with games or important ie non
Microsloth apps for example

 If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position
let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it

Thanks a lot for you input

The Quadralink by AE is a possibly problematical solution to your needs
I've used one for the last   years on my personal system but a fatal
bug has crept into their more recent sw The bug only shows up during
heavy serial traffic but completely crashes the system MacsBug can not
reboot time to hit the restart button

AE told me in January that they were aware of and working on fixing the bug
which I described to them Since then they have not answered any of my
faxes asking them for a status of the bugfix

The QL has been great but for now I have mine sidelined If you are only
going to be using  Baud or less then you may have no or very
infrequent problems

I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM I have tried to find info on this
but I could not get precise answers

On one hand we have a Quadra  with a  monitor which is capable of
bit color How much VRAM does it have

    To display Millions of colors on a  monitor you need MB of VRAM
in the Q

On the other hand we have a Quadra  with a  monitor which is capable
of bit color only so it must have  Ko of VRAM

    Correct This is the amount of onboard VRAM that the Q comes
with

I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the  and put them in the  so that
both machines have bit color capability
Is it possible and if yes how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 

    Yes this is possible Technically you only need to take out  of
the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything
because the  cannot really do anything with MB of VRAM It only
knows MB and MB

From the documentation I have the Quadra  must get  Mo VRAM to have
bit color is that correct

    Yes this is correct You get to MB by putting  k VRAM SIMMs
into the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q's motherboard

Bonus question where do VRAM SIMMs hide From the  documentation they
seem to be behind the power supply Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs

    Yup You have to take off the power supply It's only a couple of
screws so you should be ok Just make sure that everything is
disconnected from it and watch out for static discharges

Subject re Centris  Video Problem  I'm having it also
Date Sat  Apr   GMT

 When the computer is set for  colors and certain operations are done
 particularly vertical scrolling through a window horizontal white lines
 appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open
 windows  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued  If a
 window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
 the line disappear from that area of the screen  This problem is not
 observed if the monitor is configured for  colors or a  inch Apple
 monitor with  colors is used

 I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain  The problem has
 been apparent since day  but has gotten worse

etc

Has anyone NOT had these problems in the given configurations
that would help eliminate design flaw as the explanation

As a data point I'm using a Centris   with the Apple 
monitor and do NOT have these problems

    Sure I can give is a shot

I have a IIsi which I will probably keep for another  years
I would like to add more memory ie go from  MB to  MB
I know that I will need  x MB ns or faster SIMMS
Which SIMMS  pin or  pin

    You need to get the pin simms

Would the SIMMS I get today be usable in  years with a 
newer more powerful system

    If you mean in a newer more powerful Mac system then the answer
is no Apple has stated that all new Macs will use the pin SIMMs and
no longer use the pin SIMMs

Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for C regarding
fpu  In all Mac price lists I've seen every C has the message fpu
optional  I know from what we've discussed in this newsgroup that all
C have the fpu built in except the  configuration  Why would
they be so unclear about this issue in their price list

    I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the
literature and price lists being confused themselves Since there are
two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have
an FPU it does seem to be an option even though it really isn't

I'm planning to buy the C cd pretty soon but I'm now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not

    Well then allow me to end your confusion The C ONLY come with
an LC in the base  configuration If you are not getting this
configuration then you are getting an FPU

Why say optional if it's built in

    Good question I have been wondering that since Feb th

If you get the Centris  with CD configuration you are getting a Mac with
a RC processor that has builtin math coprocessor support  My 
understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing
the Centris   without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU
 
    This is possible but an option is something that you are supposed
to be able to request when you want it What Apple has done is given the
buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION

Apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonFPU system to become an FPU
system  And it is unclear whether the ' processor on the nonFPU system
a LC can be replaced with a RC supplied by another vendor

    This is not unclear at all In fact Apple has included in the ROMs
of those machines with LCs code to recognize the presence of the full
's FPU and use it Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching
chips You pop the LC out and pop in a full '

Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris  which ONLY
comes with a nonFPU LC processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU 
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another again according to Apple's memo

    They did I think I would doublecheck this It has been stated
countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware
designers that the LC and the full ' are pin compatible and that
the C can be upgraded to a full '

Sorry if this is a FAQ  I don't normally read compsysmachardware
I am purchasing a couple of Centris 's  I configured the systems
as follows

	Eight  Mb RAM
	Ethernet
	 Mb VRAM
	Math CoProcessor option

My purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent
me the Apple summary documentation to prove it  I ordered the coprocessor
option but I'm really not sure that we needed it  I thought the ' chip
had a math coprocessor built into it  Has Apple had a math coprocessor chip
architectured to keep up with the speed of the ' chip in the Centris 
I am concerned that I may have set up a hardware bottleneck

    Apple has really confused people with this whole thing I think
we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so There is
no option to get an FPU on a C What you have is a choice of CPUs
there is the LC that does not have an integrated FPU like the full
' and is only present in the base  model of the C AppleUSA
And there is the full ' which you get when you order anything other
than the base  configuration Therefore since you have ordered one
of the MB versions with onboard Ethernet models you will not be
getting the LC But even if you wanted to have the LC you wouldn't
be able to order a C with MB RAM onboard Ethernet and an LC
It's not an option
    Also a note to people out there that have  Cs and Cs
thinking that there is an optional FPU the ' class chip cannot
recognize an external FPU so there is no socket on the motherboard for
a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or
something like that The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to
replace the LC with a full ' And if you have a C you will not
need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC with the
full ' but if you have a  C you do need to have a heat sink

 Here is the story
 I have a network with  Macs on Localtalk One of them has an
 Ethernet Card and is currently connected to a NeXT don't laugh
 I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi The NeXT is connected
 to the internet over SLIP running on a  baud modem
 
 Currently we can telnet from the Mac w Ethernet to the NeXT
 and then telnet out again to the rest of the world
 
 What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
 will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT
 via the Ethernet Mac From what we have heard AIR doesn't do
 the trick
 
 Software solutions would be good too but my impression is that
 there aren't going to be any
 
 Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet
 out again The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers
 to machines so everyone shares that  numberoh well
 

  What you need is a hardware router such as EtherRouteTCP made by
Compatable Systems   This will allow you to connect your Localtalk
network  Macs to your Ethernet network NeXT and Ethernet Mac  It will
route TCPIP protocol between the two networks  Software routers are also
available for less money but I'm not sure if they work with TCPIP

Hi  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to
ask your help  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a
marketing plan for it  Technical issues are not terribly important at
this point  Well my group's plan is to market a full page monitor
for laptop computers  It would be a thirdparty product to be installed
by authorized repair centers like Newer Technology's PaletteBook
screen  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you
would get twice the screen height of a normal screen remember
technical issues aside  In fact by adjusting the fold of the screen
and the monitor configuration you could have regular OR full height 
The screen would probably be monochrome
The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very
popular among business people  Business people also commonly use word
processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient
to see a large portion of the document  Because of the target users and
applications color screens aren't really a neccessity  We could
hopefully keep the cost between  and 

Now please don't write this off as completely ridiculous  I really
need some constructive feedback  So if you would please reply to me
via email and let me know
 If you would consider buying a full page laptop screen
 How much you would be willing to pay for it
 Any helpful commentaries on the idea

Also if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it doubtful
but who knows please send me some

Thanks in advance

Mike

Dear Macfriends

I've seen the following problem om three Mac IIsi machines
all with  Mb RAM installed  or  ns SIMMs

If the contents of a window are being calculated and updated
a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated
on the screen  The lines translate to the top of the screen and
have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings they
are a few millimeters apart
I admit that they are vague but they can still be distinguished clearly
especially if the environment ie the rest of the room is a bit dark
Applications which produce this effect are
 the previewer of DirectTeX  ie DVIReader 
 Kaleidagraph FPU

The machines use their builtin video and drive the old 
Apple Hires Monochrome screen two monitorscable sets tried  
The effect is independent of the settings in the following control 
panels Memory adressing mode disk cache 
        and Monitors nr of greyscolors

Have you ever seen this effect too    Is there a solution 

Thanks
Fred

My company has developed an application for the Mac that emulates a chart
recorder  virtual pen traces scroll smoothly across the screen  As we
tested the application on a number of computers we discovered some
surprising performance differences across products  The scroll performance
of the IIsi and LCII was better than the IIfx This led us to investigate
Color Quickdraw performance across the Apple line

The results

The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the
drumroll please LCIII  And the Color Classic ranks right up there with
the Quadra line  The Centris line pales in comparison

Does anybody know the differences in these computers that explains the
disparity in graphicsprocessor performance

  might fix the problem  in my case the cartridges wouldn't

 All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my

 the problem had something to do with the Quadra  Even with the
 Quadra they mostly worked OK  The problem occurred when I ejected
 a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes
 saying This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware
 even though there was no cartridge in the drive

The problem mentioned last is a known Quadra SCSI problem it was heavily
discussed last year and an Apple employee pointed out that there was a
one byte error in the SCSI driver routine for the Quadra's at least the

and   System  should not have that problem for most people the 
solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor  In my
case MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my
Quadra
 all that occured early last year

Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at

The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller
circuitry present on NuBus Macs

Why though does anyone care about this dgr has a threePDS
adapter for the LCLCII They will soon have one for the LCIII PDS
is better than NuBus for most people in most applications Granted
there are more NuBus cards But most applications that require a

NuBus is a much more robust system for system for installing multiple

into expasion options for an SI there were a number of PDS video cards
that would not work with certian Dual slot cache adapters

Hi
A while back there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII
in Europe in countries with  Hz AC current  The consensus at the time
was that the IWII would not work there  As I will be moving there this summer
I called Apple to make sure and they told me today that the IWII as bought
in the US will definitely run on  Hz AC current as long as a stepdown
converter is employed if  V current is used  The same info turns out can
be found in the IWII manual p  in the  version but I didn't really
trust that  Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary  Just 
wondering

A question in general about displaying NTSC through a Mac

If I understand correctly the Video Spigot can display NTSC
in a small window as well as capture the data in Quicktime
format

However if I want to use a larger window what are my options
Perhaps I misunderstood the Video Spigot review  

Also I am not interested in Quicktime  I would merely like to
use my Mac as a television from time to time  I have a nice
Sony  monitor and I would like to use it as a second TV
when my wife is watching sitcoms on our regular TV  

Perhaps some of the video cards for the Mac accept NTSC input
I have a IIsi and I am willing to buy a NuBus adapter

Thanks in advance for any help

I have an SE with a  meg HD which dates back to April   When I
originally purchased it I experienced the failure to boot problem  This
was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive

Lately a similar problem has been occuring  When the computer is
powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given
the no disk to boot from icon  However upon turing the
computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine  
Furthermore if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot 
button the same problem occurs  But as I said turning the power
off and on always works

This problem is different from the  boot problem in that before
it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot

Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how
it can be fixed

I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to 
come up to speed now  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that
allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before 
trying to access the HD

Thanks

I'm in the market for a laser printer Used printers are fine nonapple
printers are fine but whatever printer I get must fit the following

Required features

 PostScript

  dpi

 emough memory to download fonts

 The cheaper the better  I'd prefer under 


Nice things

 anything over  pages per minute

 scsi output for a font disk

 smallish footprint



Don't Care About

 PostScript Level II

 networking its just for me and always will be

 color


I know about Freedom of Press but I've also heard that its painfully slow
I can tolerate about  ppm but anything slower than that and I'm not going
to consider the price savings worth it  I'd be curious to hear people's
experience with it tho 

I also infinitely prefer laser over ink I used to use HP deskjets in
my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality  I'm a laser bigot
and the first to admit it 


I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing  The
page will include multiple fonts PS graphics scanned line art and
maybe greyscale pictures not sure yet  The quality doesn't need to
be spectacular but it needs to be clear and readable


Printers I've been looking at


 used LaserWriters The plus the NT the NTR  Its my understanding that
  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk True

 Personal LaserWriter LS and NTR  I have access to the Apple Employee
  discount I work for one of Apple's spinoffs so I can get these reasonably
  cheaply  I've heard bad things about the LS comments  I'm leaning
  towards the Personal NTR cause it has a nice small footprint

 LaserWriter Select   I hear it doesn't have PostScript but I haven't
  seen anything for sure  I heard mumbles once about a postscript upgrade
  

 Used HP LaserJets  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform and
  they were painfully slow  Are they that bad on the mac

 I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap
  Any comments on this printer  I hate the styling too many ouput trays
  but if its a decent printer I'll consider it


Thanks for any comments

When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system the following types
of sounds mono as far as I can tell all play fine through BOTH
speakers

system beeps  already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record

Armor Alley
Spectre
Spaceward Ho


But the following games only play out of the left channel

Lemmings
Out of This World  awesome game BTW
Glider 
OIDS


But still STEREO system beeps do play in stereo through BOTH speakers
The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning which
my roommate downloaded from some ftp site sumex


All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates  he can't run
OOTW because he doesn't have color

We're both running system 



Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get
sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class Quadra LC PowerBook 
or
greater Centris SE etc stereo machine

I used to have a Mac II and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in
stereo on that machine not just on the left channel  I could be
mistaken though  If there were a problem with the Quad 's and PB
's I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo  If
there
isn't a problem with our machines I wonder why the  games above are
apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they
could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of
both speakers  like Spectre etc do

Quadra 's and PowerBook 's have the same ROMS to my knowledge
so maybe this is a ROM problem  if so though why wouldn't System 
patch over this problem




Thanks for any help you can provide

Mac sound hardware is diverse some macs play in stereo and
mix the output the SE for instance while others play in
stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker while
some are truly mono like the LC

Developers know that stuff played in the left channel is
guaranteed to be heard while the right channel isn't Some
send data to both some only send data to the left channel
the first is preferrable of course

Okay I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound

The original documentation for the sound hardware IM documents how to
make sound by directly accessing hardware  Basically you jam values
into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBasex This was
because
of how the Mac  and some later machines generated sound was by
scanning
this block and DAing every even byte the odd bytes went to the floppy on
some machines

When the Mac II and Apple Sound Chip was invented it was designed to
generate stereo sound It was also designed to be compatible with we had
once
documented So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant I
want to
play a mono sound and so it was emulated But Apple had since retracted
the
documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers
of
sound generation So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you
want
to make stereo sound

Enter game developers The sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games Furthermore people who port from
the
IBM don't want to learn more APIs So it has become popular for game
writers to write to SoundBase to make sound since it is very easy

Since the Mac II Apple has had many different kind of sound output
hardware
and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase
works
On some hardware Mac II IIx IIcx IIci at least writing to SoundBase
gets you mono sound through both speakers On some Macs Quadra

at least writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel
only
Both are technically correct interpretations of the original
specification
but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons

If developers use the Sound Manager and I think the sound driver mono
sounds will typically come out through both channels regardless of the
underlying hardware It is possible to specify you want to generate left
channel only but no one does If developers write to sound base their
games will only come out the left on some games

The other problem the original Mac II only producing left channel sound
on the internal speaker while the SE mixes both isn't really related
It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of
the different machines It only affects true stereo sounds Sounds which
are actually mono will play on the internal speaker no matter what
machine
you have

Now to more directly address the question the games you list
Lemmings
Out of This World  awesome game BTW
Glider 
OIDS
and also
Hellcats
Super Tetris
Oxyd
and many more these are just what I've tested

Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras


Other games you list
Armor Alley
Spectre
Spaceward Ho
and also
PGA Tour Golf
Civilization
and more these are again only from personal experience

Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines

The more of the story is to developers DON'T CHEAT
Really I am absolutely positively not allowed to do what I am about to
do
but I'm going say it anyway
Stop cheating on sound
Really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware The grace period
is about to end
The Sound Manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon so use it

In conclusion
To Doug it isn't a hardware problem at least not a bug
To Jon it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send
sound
to both channels If they do it the right way it is taken care of
automatically If you cheat there is not way to make it work on all
hardware


Have fun

Disclaimer number 
I don't work on sound here at Apple I'm just pretty well informed
So don't write me with sound questions

Disclaimer number 
If it says up above that I wrote anything like the grace period is about
to end then it is a bug in your news feed since I am catagorically not
allowed to say anything like that You know what I mean

Disclaimer number 
I don't speak for Apple just me

 	Anyway I was hoping someone knowledgeable
 about Mac internals could set me straight is it simply
 impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale or could
  	
To use the grayscale features I believe you need a Mac equipped
with colour quickdraw I was told this somewhere or other but it's
 
 I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images loaded
 with the proper software However the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on

The original poster W G Wright posted an item saying that he had bought a new
wizzbang Laser Printer from Apple a Select  I think which can print
GrayScale He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer
and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not
possible

This is the one major bugbear about doing a rd party SE upgrade compared to
Apple's SE to SE upgrade you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw It
is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale

SEs CAN print some COLOUR this is because Quickdraw  the original noncolour
version has the right hooks for eight colours Some of you will remember the
'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE I think that it
gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something

There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older
computers there are lots of Mac Pluses Classics and SEs that have been
upgraded to  and  processors which should be perfectly able to deal
with Color Quickdraw  but they wont and rd parties are having a difficult 
time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs ie Nutek et al

Just one Caveat I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT
Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer that you would be able to
do so whatever Mac you were using And I am pretty sure that the Select 
is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer  correct me if I'm wrong

Try looking at the Brainstorm Accelerator for the Plus  I believe it is

SCSI transfers  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm

Just a quick summary of recent findings re high speed modems Top three
contenders seem to be ATT Paradyne ZyXEL and US Robotics ZyXEL has the
biggest cult following and can be had for under  but I ignored it
because I need something with Mac software which will work without any
tweaking

The ATT Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability They are
backordered at the moment probably because of the special  price in
effect until May Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two
modems WARNING ATT ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit cables 
all and has lifetime warranty This applies only when you order
directly from Paradyne I called ElekTek one of the distributors and
they wanted to charge me  for cable and gave only  year warranty

USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly but not as highly recommended
it's only  from ClubMac and if you are willing to roll your own cable
and don't care about the FAXstf software you can get the generic model
from PC outlets for 

All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle and can't afford a
Motorola Codex      I ended up ordering the Dataport we'll see how
it works in two weeks or so

The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the

I think you are suffering from some alignment or color
table or whatever problems if a Color Classic is as fast
as a Quadra rendering to screen

What screen card you use does of course matter much builtin
video is almost always faster than NuBus

Or you measured scroll entire screen where the Color Classic
had a VRAM  screen in bit color and the Quadra had a

  I have answers to both of your questions  First I recommend the Sony
CPD monitor  It is a  Trinitron VGA monitor but it is designed
specifically for use with the LC  It works only with Macs with specific video
capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci  All it
takes is a MACVGA cable I recommend one from James Engineering which is
about   These cost about  as compared to the much higher prices of
comparable monitors because they are not multisynch  I have used one for half
a year and I love it  
Second I have used Syex and found them to be decent  I had a backorder on a
Supra modem which I cancelled  They were helpful in explaining the reasons
why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me  The only
complaint was that they did not always return my calls  
I have been told that the CPD is selling for  from JR's
  I think Syex is a little more but I don't know

The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system
 on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC  I
recall there being a conversation here that a  running Windows benchmarks
at about the same speed as Mhz  in system   I don't know if that is
true but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this

The subject says what I would like to do here are the details

I have a ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the
equivalent of a Plus System  and MacEnvy both identify it as such

The MacRescue board clips onto the  on the MB  It also has
a  itself  Periodically I have to remove the clip not an
entirely easy thing to do and clean the legs of the 
Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with
snap on upgrades  the 's legs will oxidize causing 
unusual system errors

Well that's me

So I would like to do something permanent and I think it would be
fairly easy to put a socket in where the  currently is and
modify the MacRescue board to plug in  What I'm not  sure of
is whether it will work  It seems to me that the two s aren't
acting independently so removing one shouldn't have any effect on
the performance of my Mac  I'm about  sure

Will someone provide the extra

We have a user that has Word  and is using symbols such as pi and
other mathematic sysmbols plus doing fractions etc

The document shows up on the screen with no problems looks fine

When she tries to print it on a IIg the pi changes to an upside down
caret and several other symbols change to double quotes at bottom of
character plus some little circles appear between words of the fractions
instead of spaces

This happens on a IIg laser printer  Tried it on serveral macs and two
different IIg's

Prints fine on an NT and NTX laser printers

What's wrong

Thanks for any help in advance

	The Quadra  goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware
read's PRAM obtains all info from last session including the volume
setting and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound and
wait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code


If the DRAM produces an error or a registers cannot be read from a device
or the device corrupts that addressdata or control paths then if it is
possible the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the 
'sad mac' sound


This is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac
If you cannot control the volume of the quadra even at boot up then i feel
there is something incorrect with the logic board 

My Quadra  does not show the problems you are having

The CD external is already shipping and has been shipping for

Demand for the units are high so they are pretty rare

Hm I've got my CD drive since 

I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's  
but I can't confirm it

Indeed CDs are bundled with it
You usually get nine CDs with demos of applications games photos etc

well folks my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after
starting life as a k way back in   sooo i'm in the market for a
new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be

i'm looking into picking up a powerbook  or maybe  and have a bunch
of questions that hopefully somebody can answer

 does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook
introductions are expected  i'd heard the c was supposed to make an
appearence this summer but haven't heard anymore on it  and since i
don't have access to macleak i was wondering if anybody out there had
more info

 has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the
ones the duo's just went through recently

 what's the impression of the display on the   i could probably swing
a  if i got the Mb disk rather than the  but i don't really have
a feel for how much better the display is yea it looks great in the
store but is that all wow or is it really that good  could i solicit
some opinions of people who use the  and  daytoday on if its worth
taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display  i realize
this is a real subjective question but i've only played around with the
machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody
who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful

 how well does hellcats perform  

thanks a bunch in advance for any info  if you could email i'll post a
summary news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the
corner

  I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your
  message but I definitely had SCSI problems between my
  Q and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive  cartridge
  drives  My solution was to get Silverlining  None of
  the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives
  in fact the only loop that worked was the Macintosh
  Software loop whatever that means
  
  I doubt this is a Quadraspecific problem  I had to get
  rid of my venerable Bernoulli  last year with enough 
  cartridges purchased at  each to make the whole thing 
  worth more than my whole computer   The tech support guys
  at Ocean Microsystems suggested that some thirdparty drivers 
  might fix the problem  in my case the cartridges wouldn't 
  formatmountpartition for AUX  
 
 All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my
 Mac Plus and my Powerbook   It was for this reason I assumed
 the problem had something to do with the Quadra  Even with the
 Quadra they mostly worked OK  The problem occurred when I ejected
 a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes
 saying This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware
 even though there was no cartridge in the drive
 
 	Mark

I have been using the PLI SONY  MO drive and now a Sharp color
scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD  terminator on my Q 
No problems  If you were using a IIfx that might be another story

Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the
end  Some boxes have internal terminators some can be switched out and
others are socketted  These count  If the box with internal terminations
cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling they have to be
disabled ie switched out or pulled out of their sockets  If you have 
boxes with internal terminations the terminations in one box has to be
disabled etc  I am sure that this has been covered by the experts

My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they
must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them  My PLI MO
drive and Sharp scanner has one for each

Good luck

Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM

I put  K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra  in the  slots closest to the
RAM SIMM slots and I got no results whatsoever  I have been told that
the builtin video should support at least bit and maybe bit color on
a Macintosh Color Display  However the Monitors control panel still
lists bit  colors as the highest possible

Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in
Do you have to do something to activate them
Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel

BTW I am running System  with  Megs of RAM

It is a  Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest
drives in terms of how it works According to the latest MacLeak the 
drive has a  ms access time  MBs sustained throughput these figures
are from memory so they could be slightly off but they give you an idea of
performance nonetheless The drive was originally released for the PC
and just recently was released for the Mac world don't ask me what the 
differences are and through they are currently in limited supply according
to a Syquest rep they are in the process of ramping up for mass production
I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak
including PLI MassMicro ClubMac and MacWarehouse's PowerUser The PLI
and MassMicro units are priced at just around  the lesser name brands
are going for around  for an external drive Cartridges which hold 
 MB sell for about  each At these prices the drives and cartridges
are cheaper and better performing than the MB drives
Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli
drives but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper and more
reliable  Personally I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to 
getting my hands on one

ECIt was called the Mac XL when Sculley came on board I bought one at

drive were introduced To pacify people who bought the XL and only found
it was discontinued within a year Apple sent people like I a letter
saying for  and the XL they would give me a meg Mac Plus with
the HD

The Lisa was originally introduced in  or ' I forget now and
sold for  with  k floppy drives and Mb memory It didn't do
too well grin

Before becoming the Mac XL it was called a Lisa  It had a built in
meg HD by this time and was expandable to Mb RAM although that's not
what the  in  stood for It was the second coming of the Lisa It
also predated the Mac Plus AND the Mb serial HD by quite a few months
For a short while it WAS the power users system

Interestingly enough the CDROM i that came with my Quadra  has 
only  disks

 System Install
 Kodak Photo CD sampler
 Alice to Ocean
 CDROM Titles
 Application Demos
 Mozart Dissonant Quartet
 Nautilus
 Apple Chronicles

Has anyone else noticed that they got less than everyone seems to be
getting with the external  What I really feel I missed out on is what
is supposed to a fantastic Games demo disk

I have heard that people have gotten up to  disks with their drive
I assume they get the  titles above plus Cinderella and the Games Demo CDROM

any comments and experiences  Should I call Apple to complain

 I would appriciate if I can get any postitivenegative experience with this

Somebody in compmultimedia was also having trouble using a Spigot in his

which fixed things

Send follow ups to compsysmacadvocacy Sorry about the header but the 
Pnews here does not let one easily change the headers and I gave up after a 
year of trying This sheet is also available by FTP on sumexaimstanfordedu 
 in the infomacreport as macibmcomparetxt
Mac  IBM InfoVersion 

The reason for this general data sheet is to consolidate and condense the 
information out there so that people in both camps can be clear and accurate 
about what they are saying about their machines  Since computer technology 
is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will 
be lacking or incorrect on information  So please just don't say the sheet 
is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to 
make the needed corrections  All prices are in US dollars
To keep this data sheet organized please provide if possible article 
citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to 
a minimum  As this is a general data sheet keep the info provided simple so 
I can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to others 
Finally keep the information relevant to the section corrected For example 
OS code in ROM is software contained in hardware so no more of the 'but it 
is supported in OS disk software' data for the hardware section please 
Thank you

The CPUs
 Note I am only showing Motorola  Intel CPUs used in Mac and most IBMPC 
clone machines For example since Apple never used the Motorola  and 
 in the Mac these chips are not listed Years only appear with dead CPUs 
and indicate first to last year used as a CPU
Cache note  both IBM and Mac use caches external to the CPUs These external 
caches increase the speed of the CPU but are not a part of it  In most of 
the present Macs there are external caches builtin while with IBM they are 
optional Though machines are generally sold with them installed  Since 
there are many different external caches CPUMac and IBM SCSI video disk 
and static RAMMac each having a different effect on CPU performance and 
they are machine KB static RAM cache in IIci IIfx and IIvx seller 
cache card installed in some IIcis or expansion IIci cache cards go up to 
KB dependent I have decided to leave them out of the list

CPUs Comparison List
As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the 
same frequency      dx but Intel has chips at 
higher frequencies than Motorola so this evens out  The Macintosh Bible th 
ed supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the  
and above

      bit vs bit chip data pathaddress 
linesdata  address registers  The MB limit on the  Macs brings it 
down to the  and lower chips otherwise it would compare to the 

          hardware segmenting vs 's bit ALU and these chips 
come have no usable builtin MMU unlike their successors    The 
hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS   and Windows X 
The use of the hardware segmenting and their bit nature put the  between 
the  and  in features and the LC's bit data path strenghthens the 
   comparison

         Two bit chips with MMUs and protected memory  AUX  
is at present the only Mac OS to use the 's protected memory feature for 
apps  System x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the 
Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras  
The Color Classic and LCII bit hardware data paths makes the s in them 
comparative to sxs

sx    LC same as  and  without the FPU used as a low cost 
solution for people who do not need the FPU  Only with programs sensitive to

Color SupportDisplay
 Mac  MHz Pixel Clock standard  All present Macs support the use of 
bit color through bit color QuickDraw in ROM  bit color QuickDraw 
allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit Xbit images in Y
bit color and retain ALL the colors of Ybit color Where X and Y 
independently are      or  regardless of monitor resolution  
dpi  color to  dpi PaletteBook or monitor type including 
autosynchronous VGA MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including  hz 
vertically and  kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor MacUser 
Aug    Older machines that supported color SE II IIX and 
IIcx had only bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use bit 
color MacUser Special   
To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only  or  bit display 
capability builtin but most of those can be expanded to display bit 
color    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for  dpi display QuickDraw QX 
will change this
In addition QuickDraw allows in Macs with a NuBus slot more then one 
monitor to be used in any combination from two monitors showing the same 
thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree 
of overlap of the pictures
VRAM Video RAM  Standard for present nonPowerBook Mac's handling of 
 builtin video from a bit color palette VRAM provided runs a bit
 color x display expandable to bit color or a bit x display 
Sound output  Standard in all Macs since the K  Stereo sound became 
 standard with the SE

IBM  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system 
interacts with the video hardware Nan Zou the use of drivers bypassing 
BIOS video hareware inconsitancies see Super VGA below and nonstanderzation
of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware OS and program 
interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question Faisal Nameer 
Jawdat In addition IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a 
standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is 
actually present Matt Healy nor a standardized screendrawing toolbox like 
Mac's QD As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes 
especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly At present 
things are so dependent on the interaction of the program OS print driver 
and monitor card that editing bit pictures regardless of color mode OS 
and monitor typecard combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with 
an IBM  For example one cannot edit a bit color picture done on a OS 
 with a SVGA monitor on a  with VGA bit color palette and DOS  
and still have ALL the colors one started out with
Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators faster 
processors and modular upgradeability and may have builtin sound cards CD

SVGA  Super VGA
 This is not a standard in the way the others were but instead was a 'catch 
 all' category for a group of video cards  As such with each manufacturer 
 using their own implementation scheme SVGA was chaos with people debating
 as to what is SVGA and what is not  In an effort to make SVGA more of a 
 standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units but things
 are still a mess  Video is either K  or M today resolution
 of x and x at  and  colors are common newer ones since 
  have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC giving bit  colors at x 
 some of the very newer ones  can do  bits per pixel usually 
 at x  Speedwise too much variation some very slow Western Digital

 some are soso like Tseng ET a very popular chipset  Some limiting 
 factors overcome by MHz VL Bus  's linear address mapping were 
  MHz ISA bus AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a 
 K window etc

XGA
 Accelerates graphics functions up to  times faster than standard VGA in
 Windows and OS including line draws bit and pixelblock transfers area
 fills masking and XY addressing Has an intelligent way to detect and co
 exist with other XGA cards so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be 
 far away  Since this is an architecture its resolution and color depth 
 isn't fixed IBM implements only bit  color while other 
 companies can have bit color through IBM technical licenses Refresh 
 rates up to  Hz ensures flicker free rock solid images to reduce visual 
 discomfort and is VGA compatible Up to x on OS

Expansion
Both Mac  IBM
SCSI only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM
 Allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner Nubus card 
 expansion Mac Plus only some monitors and CDROM  
 Main problem  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM 
SCSI   devices per SCSI controller  bit asynchronous MBs ave
 and synchronous MBs max transfers  Difference is due to SCSI software
 drivers  Fast SCSI is a misname for bit SCSI in SCSI mode
 see SCSI for details
SCSI  devices per SCSI controller in SCSI mode  SCSI is fully
 SCSI compliant and bit SCSI tends to be implemented as a very fast
 SCSI since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  
 hardware and software that  and bit SCSI do  Transfer speeds are
 MBs with MBs burst bit MBs with MBs burst bit and
 MBs with MBs burst bitwide and fast  Since bit SCSI can
 use SCSI software drivers and hardware at bit SCSI speeds and as such
 is limited to  devices sometimes it is mistakenly called fast SCSI 
 bit fast SCSI requires a SCSI software driver and SCSI electronics
 but can still use the SCSI ports  Wide bit and bit SCSI require a
 different SCSI port electronics and software driver from SCSI Which
 makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces
Mac SCSI asynchronous SCSI builtin standard since the Plus  Even though 
 Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers the OS SCSI Manager
 needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI
 interfaces  As a result present SCSI Macs use bit SCSI as a fast 
 asynchronous SCSI  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI
 controller chip builtin Digital Review Oct   v n p 
 though they lack some other parts of the hardware like the wide SCSI port 
 interface  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI older NuBus 
 Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU  Rumorsome
 Cyclone Macs June will come with a wide  fast SCSI port standard 
 and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager
IBM SCSI  SCSI is not too wide spread yet generally not bundled with 
 systems except as addon EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable
 Like the Mac bit SCSI is used as a very fast SCSI by most controllers
 out there  Unlike the Mac IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications
 which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI

Mac
Memory expansion with a few exceptions the Mac has used nonparity pin 
 bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus  While pin bit parity SIMMs
 could be used in these Macs only special IIcis could make use of the parity 
 feature By convension both SIMM types are called pin SIMMs  The IIfx 
 used pin parity SIMMs  The LC III C and Q all use a new 
 pin SIMM that is accessable by bits at a time and is used in IBMs
 The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writingreading every
 memory location if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will
 not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is
 Since Macs made before Feb   managed memory baced on data path SIMMs 
 had to be installed in pairs bit or in sets of  bit  The Centris 
  and Quadra  eliminate this with a new memory management setup that 
 allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time  If the SIMMs are the same 
 size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting 
 in a  performance boost on RAM access MacWorld Apr

CPU expansion handled either through the PDS or the NuBus  Unlike PDS  
 Nubus CPU cards exampleRadius Rocket allow use of multiple processors at 
 the same time  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to 
 dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved Each 
 NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with 
 MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard

IBM
Memory expansion  parity SIMMs nonparity SIMMs some newer models do a Mac

HD Interfaces limited to hard drives by design or lack of development 
MFM  Modified Frequency Modulation RLL  Run Length Limited

IDE  Integrated Device Electronics 
 Asynchronous MBs max and synchronous MBs max transfer

ESDI  Enhanced Small Device Interface
 MBs throughput generally considered better interface than SCSI in
 many ways but not common enough for practical consideration  Outside of
 hard drives device choices are very limited compared to SCSI 

BUS interfaces
New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working

K to MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM  This allows 
Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS QuickDraw 
menu commands print mouse SCSI  sound drivers etc in ROM which require 
clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks Which requires 
access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM 
chips Plus vs Classic for example  With key hooks for the OS support 
interface in ROM programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS 
has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and 
therefore can write smaller programs  This also allows Apple greater control 
over hardwaresoftware standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and with 
some of the tookbox command code in ROM with lower RAM requirements then a

IBM
 Machiness have little GUI code data and hooks present in hardware for 
programmers to work with so most of the coding must be provided in the OS  
Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM  In addition 
what little ROM code there is also read into RAM a process called Shadow ROM  
This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or 
EPROMS  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to 
better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which 
is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed  In addition it 
reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware 
support is needed

 Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment SANE or Standard 
Apple Numerics Environment Floating point numbers are  bits long when an 
FPU is present and  bits otherwise Exceptions such as dividing by zero or 
taking the square root of a negative number do not cause an abort but are 
handled in a logically consistent manner  produces the internal 
representation for infinity INF   produces zero The above treatment 
of  occurs in an FPUequipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and 
the FPU programmed directly

IBM
 Floating point numbers are bits with a hardware FPU bits when 
emulated  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever 
compiler or assembler was used for a program On older DOS complilers 
exceptions could cause program aborts  and  would abort to the DOS 
prompt at the point where they occured  Most present compilers handle this 
better  Result there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS 
Windows and OS programs nor between programs for just one OS

Networking Includes printing
WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially 
if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer
Mac
Hardware Builtin LocalTalk network port and a builtin printer port  
LocalTalk has moderate speeds  Kbs requires special connectors for 
each machine  and up and can be run off of either the printer port to 
include very old macs or the network port standard today  Builtin 
Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at 
about  for each machine  These cards provide three connectors and 
transceivers thick thin and BaseT for Ethernet
The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet 
interface on motherboard with transceivers available TokenRing has been a 
network option since 
Software AppleTalk the suite of protocols standard with Mac OS which can 
use variety of media types  AppleShare client software included with the OS 
as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware Com Open 
Banyan Vines DEC Pathworks Apple's AppleShare servers System  File Sharing 
machines and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts  MacTCP allows 
typical TCPIP communications telnet ftp NFS rlogin  A later version 
will have Unix XOpen Transport Interface XTI builtin by the end of  
MacWeek   Thirdparty software to connect to NFS servers  DEC 
Pathworks provides DECnet support  Peertopeer file sharing software 
builtin to System  See OS section  Full server software is extra 
Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in 
the chooser  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the 
chooser  The same is true of connecting to servers
Printing bugs  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font
 QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems

IBM  
Hardware LocalTalk not widely used Ethernet  and TokenRing
Software Novell Netware Banyan Vines DECNet WindowsWork Groups AppleTalk 
protocols and AppleShare subset of AppleTalk
Each of the MSDOS networking schemes are in general totally incompatible 
with the others Once you have chosen one you are pretty much lockedin to 
that product line from then on  WindowsWork Groups is a little more 
forgiving and removes some of this problem  Novell Netware is the biggest 
 percent of the corporate market and in general is more powerful and 
offers better controlmanagementsecurity than AppleShare but it's also more 
complex to set up and manage  This will change due to the use of the Mac 
finder and file management system by Novell PC Week     
InfoWorld Dec  MacWeek 
Printing Very OS dependent
DOS If it's a single user then you plug the printer into the parallel port 
 and don't worry about it Tweeking may be needed with poorly written 
 software  Network Printing is not controlled by the system but is mostly 
 implemented by the actual program therefore performance varies from one 
 software program to the next
Windows x supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing jobs 
 in the print queue but it always lists printers as active even if they 
 are not  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers 
 on the same net because there's no way for software to reliably determine 
 which printer is active right now  Windows for Workgroups is more Maclike 
 and intelligent about this
OS Maclike the os deals with printers with apps making calls to the OS
Printing bugs due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do 
not have WYSIWYG printing  This is the fault of the programs in question and 
not that of the OS involved

Price issue This is very dynamic with Mac providing more buildin features 
than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars 
by both worlds
The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware 
standarization which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to 
handle ALL the variation in hardware  When one adds all the standard Mac 
hardware features to an IBM builtin inputoutput sound support SCSI PDS  
builtin monitor support builtin networking standard mouse interface and 
NuBus  in higher machines the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent 
equipted IBM machine Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs 
which cuts some more of the Mac's cost MacUser Aug 
 Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 
All Macs below come with a PDS slot VRAM and SCSI built in  Except where 
noted monitor is extra and a builtin monitor interface is provided no card 
needed except for bit color display

 I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your

 the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives
op that worked was the Macintosh
 Software loop whatever that means
 
 I doubt this is a Quadraspecific problem  I had to get
 rid of my venerable Bernoulli  last year with enough

 worth more than my whole computer   The tech support guys
 at Ocean Microsystems suggested that some thirdparty drivers 
 might fix the problem  in my case the cartridges wouldn't

hat the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my
Mac Plus and my Powerbook   It was for this reason I assumed
the problem had something to do with the Quadra  Even with the
Quadra they mostly worked OK  The problem occurred when I ejected
a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes
saying This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware
even though there was no cartridge in the drive

	Mark
t to format I have this confirmed from Apple Computer in Sweden I work for a Apple dealer as a service tech We had problems that Quadras wanted to format a diskette or a Syquest when ther was nothing in the drive This problem was fixed sytem

Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM

I put  K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra  in the  slots closest to the
RAM SIMM slots and I got no results whatsoever  I have been told that
the builtin video should support at least bit and maybe bit color on
a Macintosh Color Display  However the Monitors control panel still
lists bit  colors as the highest possible

the Q will only do bit or bit color  if you want the higher
color depth it's MB's of VRAM altogether for a monitor up to 

for a  monitor you can get bit max

hope this answers your questions

Hmmm Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  
trying to use Kermit  I was building a serial connection between my Duo   
and my NeXT  I think the problem was in the handshaking  Basically you need  
to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides  A safe  
place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end  One problem is  
that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  
wrong and only a reset will clear it  I don't know the specifics  But this  
could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system   
It could very well be that you are doing things righteventually but one  
wrong move like trying a bad handshaking protocol can screw up any further  
correct actions until the next machine reset  I have wedged my Mac and also  
my NeXT that way

Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  
problem and at pretty high speeds too

I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses but I think the Zilog  is  
pretty standard

Hope this helps

 ATTENTION Mac Quadra owners Many storage industry experts have
 concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
 from the standard SCSI specification This results in silent corruption
 of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices
 Although I will not name the devices since it is not their fault an
 example would be a Sony  inch MO without the special Maccompatible
 firmware installed One solution sometimes is to disable blind writes
 
To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and
blind transfers  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question
Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of sec occur
This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
devices can hiccup in the middle of blocks  If this happens in the middle
of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
depending on which direction the tranfer was going  In anycase the SCSI Manager
will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
it is out of sync  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't
pay attention to the errors coming back

Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but
rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager  The problem occurs when
the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte
hasn't been clocked yet  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus
error handler and doesn't crash the machine

I have had my Q running with a  MHz osc for a few months I have a
number of SCSI devices connected Quantum LP Maxtor  Toshiba MKF via
Emulex adapter Pioneer DRM and have had no trouble

Is this being done with the motherboard's SCSI interface If this is possible
then a bit of experimenting with just plain old clock oscillators may be
in order Give us some more details please

The Logitech ScanMan  is a nice unit compact and effective it will
bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality Note that its effective
resolution in grey scale mode is only about  dpi If you don't intend
to magnify a graphic it works fine A true  level gray scanner would
work better for images

I've seen the ScanMan go for as little as  used It is a reasonable buy
at that price Higher end hand scanners are almost as expensive as used
flat bed scanners Here is Seattle the paper shows occasional good bargains

After reading reports from Germany of success in accelerating a Quadra

 mhz clock chip I put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a
 mhz TTL clock oscillator I had left over from working on some SI's
I can't believe it It actually works I'm not getting SCSI timing errors
either This is only after a short run time but I'll keep posting results
Did I spend all that money on the VSO for nothing If this keeps working
the lack of a double boot in itself will be worth the effort

  You are correct assuming that SIMMs will not fit into a LaserWriter
Apple printers either require  pin SIMMs like those in the Mac IIfx or
special memory chips Contact your Apple dealer to find out exactly what

a K cache card gives you only about a  speedup Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache cardand get a miss thus a small cache card
of K may be worth  I don't know what kind of numbers K cards get

The si has a single expansion slot that can be either PDS or Nubus but not
both together The card lies parallel to and above the motherboard  HD and
requires an adaptor slot to do this There are Nubus and PDS adaptort cards
Thus what kind of slots you have depends on what kind of adapter card you
have With the exception of the Radius rocket all NuBus cards I know of work
in the si PDS slots and thus cards are Mac specific thus not all PDS cards
work in all Macs

Hi there

I wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display
card for driving a  multisync NEC D
The NEC D can do horizontal refresh from  kHz to  kHz and
vertical from  Hz to  Hz and can do max x interlaced
though I am looking for something more like x or x
noninterlaced
It would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite
freely within these limits and is capable to display at least
bitspixel preferably more

Is there anything on the market that comes even close


Thanks

Hi there

What is your recommendation for a good harddisk driver software for
nonApple drives I would mainly need it for a SyQuest removable media
drive but maybe for some normal drives too
I have heard and seen good things about SilverLining but don't know
any competitors It does not need to be fancy filled with features
I more like it affordable

Could be better caching on the disk
Could be faster coil for seeks
Could be that the disk spins faster so data transfers faster
Could be that data is packed tighter so it transfers faster
Could be a faster SCSI command decoder in the drive

Hello I have a question or two about the serial ports for the
powerbooks specifically the  with system  Is there a
difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus
any other mac say plus or ii I have heard though not confirmed
by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds

I also heard that sys 's new power manager 'fixes' this problem
allowing speeds just as any other serial port

My particular use is that I have a  EVB board that I need to
interface with my powerbook via the modem port at  baud 
Currently we are interfacing using mac pluses  I set everything
up just as in lab and nothing  In fact the powerbook locks up

Can anyone help inform advise I would appreciate it  
I would prefer email since I don't read the news at all
I will post a summary if enough response is generated

Thanks

You need to add two K VRAM SIMMs  K VRAM SIMMs will not work in any 
of the Quadra or Centris machines  There is already K of VRAM soldered 
to the logic board  You add the two K SIMMs to this to give you a

Just a quick summary of recent findings re high speed modems Top three
contenders seem to be ATT Paradyne ZyXEL and US Robotics ZyXEL has the
biggest cult following and can be had for under  but I ignored it
because I need something with Mac software which will work without any
tweaking

You shouldn't have ignored the ZyXEL  It can be purchased with a Mac
bundle which includes a hardwarehandshaking cable and FaxSTF software
The bundle adds between  and  to the price of the modem depending
on the supplier  It is true that the modem has no Macspecific docs
but it doesn't require much 'tweaking' aside from setting D in the
init string to enable hardware handshaking

For more information on the ZyXEL including sources look at various files

Last week's MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramsey's
Mac IIx has been running nicely with a Mac IIci ROM in it offering
clean bit ROM code liberating his IIx from the virtual memory
nightmare caused by Apple's bit System Enabler

Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs  Is it okay for a
remanufacturer to resell only ROM chips from used machines  I know that
copies cannot be made but it seems to me that it would be okay to
resell the original used ROM  After all reselling a used computer
involves the sale of the ROM anyway so what's the difference

Needless to say I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM  What would
be a reasonably price to offer

 Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they
 get with the cards I have only one report which seems to indicate
 that a K cache card gives you only about a  speedup 

Ok  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a KB cache
It's small enough that I will attach it

I have also measured some real programs with and without the  KB
cache  The speedup varies a lot from app to app ranging from  to
  I think an average of  is about right  The subjective
difference is not great but is sometimes noticable  A simple cache
card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously
better  I do not have an FPU

The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers
offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference
between K and K caches  I bought mine from Third Wave for well
under   I have had absolutely no problems at all with it

If you get complete speedometer runs for a K cache I'd like to
see them  Let's check the conventional wisdom  The so called
Performance Rating numbers by themselves are of no interest

MCP is a development platform for hardwaredesigners so they can use a card
with an own processor and thus the main processor isn't needed for these cards
Currently the only cards I know are

 the Apple TokenRingCard
 the new Apple EthernetCard
 the Apple NuBUS serial card

Perhaps there are some thirdpartycards but I don't know

Last week's MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramsey's
Mac IIx has been running nicely with a Mac IIci ROM in it offering
clean bit ROM code liberating his IIx from the virtual memory
nightmare caused by Apple's bit System Enabler

 This would make me a bit suspect of Mr Ramsey's qualifications
as a selfstyled expert in fact when I read about anybody
using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder   

Yes one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM of the 
correct size obviously in an older machine but one should be 
prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine 
type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect 
conclusions when specialcasing  especially timingdependent
and driverrelated stuff

In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble 
of ROMswapping  The Apple bit enabler has problems but
MODE works just fine with   and 

Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs  

Sure  Buy a used IIci motherboard  Call PreOwned Electronics
Shreve or other parts dealers see the back of Computer Shopper
or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers and ask for a price
on a IIci ROM  Everything has a price  If you happen to find
somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard you might
get a decent price  There is probably a market for used mother
boards as well so they might sell a ROM anyway

Needless to say I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM  What would
be a reasonably price to offer

Ask for a quote and then try offering less  PreOwned and
Shreve have been known to dicker  Their ads in various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices for the 
same items and their phone quotes tend to vary as well

Still I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading 
the ROM in a IIx

I recently got a Centris   on my desk It's a vast improvement on
my previous machine a IIsi  However 

I've encountered a problem with fonts 

Entries in a Filemaker  database which looked fine when printed from my
previous mac using System  now look wierd 

Spacing between characters has increased greatly  causing lines to be
truncated I'm using plain and bold Helvetica in various sizes  the
increase in character spacing seems to occur for all sizes and styles 

I'm using a mixture of TrueType and FixedSize fonts  exactly as on my
IIsi  when things worked perfectly

We've managed to get similar behaviour using Word 

Apple UK adopted their usual friendly approach and told us to call our
local dealer  God help us 

Any ideas

What I did NOT get with my drive CDi is the System Install CD you
listed as   Any ideas about how I can get one  I bought my IIvx 
from Direct Express in Chicago no complaints at all  good price  good

BTW I've heard that the System Install CD can be used to boot the mac

I'm currently trying to select which magnetooptical drive to purchase  I'm
primarily looking at MB drives although I might consider MB ones

When looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads the prices for the MB drives
seem to range from just under  for the DGR REM Portable Magic MB
Portable Fujitsu or NuDesign MB from MacDirect to about  for the
FWB HammerDisk  and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO  Different drives
use different mechanisms  MOST Fujitsu Sony Epson probably some others

My problem is that after reading the Nov  MacWorld and Apr  MacUser
reviews of these drives I'm still not sure what to get  So I'm asking
if anyone has had goodbad experiences with any MB MO drive or can shed
some light on the wide range of prices is spending more really buying me
much reliability of different drives compatibility between them or 
anything else I should probably know

Thanks

the correct switch setting to use out of the given nonappletalk switch

That seems about right  I have a Mac IIsi  with k cache card running

Enter game developers The sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games

The Sound Driver is pretty ok since it's fast Sound Manager used by the
book is useless Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed
is out of the question for games with smooth animation It's too slow

The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager Unfortunately
System  supports it poorly making programs crash occasionally

The more of the story is to developers DON'T CHEAT
Really I am absolutely positively not allowed to do what I am about to
do
but I'm going say it anyway
Stop cheating on sound
Really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware The grace period
is about to end
The Sound Manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon so use it

Well I want my code to work on old systems too I don't know about sys 
but at least on  there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes
channels to hang with no error message This happends when I keep a
channel open for long periods  necessary for performance  and play many
sounds stopping sounds halfway Callbacks seems not to be reliable
Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to
inspect private variables in the channel QHead I think it was and the
only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an
undocumented flag and modify it

Am I happy with this Nope I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get
rid of the bugs

Any better suggestions Silent games is not among the acceptabe solutions

Even better than that  how does a based Amiga  perform in

Answer except in a very few cases I get my butt kicked by the Amiga
Sure there are other considerations but it goes to show you how
proper design from the beginning in hardware and software can give
you great returns  as well as showing you that if you don't have a 
marketing department to speak of no one will care how good your system is

I'm still happy with my ci but I don't understand why the performance is
so bad comparatively  They could have done multitasking properly
They could have done everthing else better  but apple didn't
of course DOS  and windows  are nothin to write home about either

Oh well y'all got  worth for the price of

for the program reside at one place the PC hard disk So my question for you

  is there a board for the PC that will allow you to hook into an appletalk
    network

  if  is possible is there any softwarehardware combination that will 
    allow me to mount the PC hard disk as a networked disk on the macs so I
    can use Soft PC to run the application

  if  or  is impossible is there any other way to accomplish what I am

The problem is that the Plus's poor old power supply sometimes referred to as

You can of course try and readjust the voltage levels the v rail should

I guess the real question is

Who asked the original questions and why was it so broad
Are we talking pure processing power what kind of processing BTW
isolated from every other factor and influence in the system  
Or are we shopping for a home computer based on the CPU specs yuck

I just finished a project that involves realtime processing of serial
data and discovered that the programming interface assembly has
a lot to do with the power of a CPU in a particular application
If what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given
then not only is it easy but it's cheap and quick  If you have to
fake things like resolving indirection without a LEA instruction then
your cycle count goes through the roof

well let's NOT start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose
The orginal question was about classifying microprocessors
having reread the entire thread I don't think much more can be said without
getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given


That's it for another 

Cheers everyone

 Hi there
 
 What is your recommendation for a good harddisk driver software for
 nonApple drives I would mainly need it for a SyQuest removable media
 drive but maybe for some normal drives too

FWB distributes HDT Personal Edition HDT  Hard Drive Toolkit which
is what I own This is less fancy than the full version but good
enough for what you and I want to do Casa Blanca offers Drive but
I'm not that familiar with it I think that both Drive and HDT PE
can be had for around US

I've used Silverlinging at work v  and I like HDT PE much
better IMHO it has a better interface and easier to understand

Any Drive users

I put  K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra  in the  slots closest to the
RAM SIMM slots and I got no results whatsoever  

Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in

The VRAM SIMMs go in the slots at the back  closest to the power supply

Sorry this must be a FAQ but it's a quick fix that I need to take care of  
before a demo in less than  hours from now Couldn't think of a better place  
for a rapid answer than compsysmachardware

I need to connect the Serial A of a Compac  PC to the printer port of a  
Mac IIci Does anyone have handy the pinpin routing for the cable that would  
allow this connection 

The serial port on the Compaq is a MALE DB How would this map to the DIN of  
the Mac serial I tried one of those really short femaleDBmaleDIN cables  
that Apple sold as adaptors to plug in Macintosh serial peripherals from the  
preMacPlus era This cable didn't do it Do I need a null modem adaptor as  
well on the DB side of things 

I just need to be able to map the data TX and RX pins correctly


thanks kindly

I have a mac plus with MB RAM I have just bought an extra MB so that
I can have the max MB RAM that a plus supports However I can't get it
to boot after I install the  extra SIMMs Instead I get a sad mac Sorry
but I can't remember the code Looking at the motherboard I can see
that  resistors have been snipped off where it says Kb path 
 row I assume that was done when the first MB SIMMs were added

So my question is Are there any other resistors that need snipping 
				or Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged

Any and all advice will be appreciated

  Basically the Mac Pluses are constantly rebooting themselves as if the
  reboot button were being pushed  Sometimes the Mac is able to fully boot


well this threads been going long enough I'll add a diferent twist

I found that the constant rebooting was due to overheating We 
had added Mb ram and were operating in a non AC environment
Adding an external cooling fan fixed it right up  over a
year ago

Of course the manuals say nothing about the interface connector layout or

I believe the FPU on the LCIII is always supposed to go on the logic
board not in the PDS board I have heard of crashing problems with
PDSbased FPUs on the LCIII Asante may have fixed them but why
bother Why bother building an LCIII card with an FPU anyway The
extra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail I say FPU on
main logic board in socket Ethernet alone on PDS card in slot

 Hey
 
 I'm about to purchase a DAT drive  Does anyone know which mail order vendors
 offer DAT drives with HP's mechanism  What other mechanism is available out
 there  Good bad points

	We bought one from Relax technologies  BIG mistake  The drive
had some jumpers set incorrectly so it didn't work at first and the
software they shipped with it was incompatable with the drive it was the
new compression model and worst of all when I opened the drive up to
fiddle with the jumpers I found the inside of the case COVERED WITH METAL
FILINGS Sorry to shout  Apparently when they drilled the mounting holes
in the case they forgot to clean it before putting the drive in  This was
a HP drive by the way and is now working fine knock on wood no thanks
to Relax technologies

Hey your mileage may vary but let me suggest that you NOT buy from Relax
Technologies even though their prices are usually about the lowest

I purchased an LCIII recently and had heard a bit about a rework of the
logic board  I opened mine up and found the same rework with a small
chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two 
other chips  I'd like to know more about it  Could anyone with any or all of
the following information please post it  Thanks a bunch

	What does the rework accomplish ie what does it fix
	What are the technical details of the rework  I'm looking for
	things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected
	and the pinouts for those chips
	Is a board with the rework any different functionally from one without
	Could the reworked boards be incompatible with future releases of
	the operating system

	and finally

	Should I even be concerned about any of this

 When the computer is set for  colors and certain operations are done
 particularly vertical scrolling through a window horizontal white lines
 appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open
 windows  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued  If a
 window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
 the line disappear from that area of the screen  This problem is not
 observed if the monitor is configured for  colors or a  inch Apple
 monitor with  colors is used

Has anyone NOT had these problems in the given configurations
that would help eliminate design flaw as the explanation

As a data point I'm using a Centris   with the Apple 
monitor and do NOT have these problems


I can produce similar artifacts

I am using a Centris  with an Apple  monitor  I got the CD
configuration so there is onboard ethernet and  Megabyte of video ram
The effect only occurs in  color and  grey modes  Any vertical scrolling operation whether with a scrollbar or say using vi and inserting lines
will produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen
They do not persist  each is visible for perhaps one refresh and then
that part of the screen is back as usual

They seem to always start at or about the th pixel from the left
and are maybe  pixels wide  This is certainly not preventing me from
using my Macintosh  but it does seem to be a sign of something
perhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry


I went ahead and called the Apple Customer Assistance Center at
   or  more direct

The person who answered was polite   I also took the chance to complain
about my mouse button sticking and about the mac hanging on boot after a
hard  killed MacsBug crash which left a CD in the drive  I had to play
with a paperclip for about  minutes to get thing to eject after which the
mac booted fine

Its not a difficult operation the cables and such are standard
except for SCSI ID  SCSI ID is usually three jumper pads labelled
AA on Quantums

I am trying to put a MB drive from my LC into a case  It is a Conner
CPA  I can't figure out which jumpers are the SCSI ID jumpers
Is anyone familiar with this drive

At the end of the drive oposite the  pin pibbon connector there
are eleven pins which look like this


        o o o o o   o   
          o o o o   o   

         L  CR   C

where the o are pins and the L CR C represent some of the
silk screen notation near these pins

Elsewhere on the board there are four jumper pads marked EEEE
on the silk screen

Does anyone know where the SCSI ID AAA pins are and where the
drive activity light LED should be plugged into

        I am currently managing among many other labs a lab with three 
LC IIs a Mac Plus with  MB external HD and a LaserWriter II NTX My 
problem The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace
        These LC IIs have  MB RAM K VRAM and a Quantum LPS HD 
installed I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit  and 
it gives a very respectable  overall rating to this drive so it's not 
the drive I have reinstalled System  MSWord a MSWorks  and 
so on all from the master disks In short I have done everything I can 
think of in software I am not a hardware hacker though I pop cases 
fairly often But nothing works
        The problem is intermittent and unpredictable The mouse always 
moves smoothly floppies always run at the same speed but occasionally 
for about  hours at a time a machine will run like it was running on 
a  MHz  not a  MHz  It is VERY frustrating and makes it 
nearly unusable It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity
        Has anyone encountered this problem before Has anyone got any 
ideas They would be much appreciated

	We bought one from Relax technologies  BIG mistake  The drive
had some jumpers set incorrectly so it didn't work at first and the
software they shipped with it was incompatable with the drive it was the
new compression model and worst of all when I opened the drive up to
fiddle with the jumpers I found the inside of the case COVERED WITH METAL
FILINGS Sorry to shout  Apparently when they drilled the mounting holes
in the case they forgot to clean it before putting the drive in  This was
a HP drive by the way and is now working fine knock on wood no thanks
to Relax technologies

I have found that you should observe the following with almost all new
equipment 

Check for warrany tape  If none carefully open unit

Inspect for loose wires jumpers screws and other trash

Clean up these manufacturing mistakes

Now power up the unit and check it out

I can't think of how many things I've bought that weren't okay right out of
the box due to sloppy QC

PS  This goes for any manufacturer  I'm not picking on anyone

done any of this or maybe even know someone who did  I would appreciate any

My friend has a Macintosh IIfx on which he is running System  not enough
memory yet to run Sys adequately and he noticed that when he tries to use
Multifinder on this machine the machine will beep every few seconds
incessantly nonstop

Now this friend has a tendency to install things on his machine rather
haphazardly but he did rebuild his System from scratch and it still occurs 
Does this problem sound familiar at all to anyone  For all I know the problem
is caused by something really obscure but if this is a known simple thing
yeah right that someone is familiar with like System  Multifinder
doesn't run on a Mac IIfx or if someone here knows what he should be looking
for please send email either to me or to him smhvaxfacdnjittcom

 I HAVE A QUESTION  
 
  
       Congratulations  You've come to the right place  Usenet is 
  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions
  How do I lock a floppy disk to queries that would make Steve
  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror  I used
  ResEdit to remove resources Init  WDEF  and nVIR  from my
  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string AB as a
  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box
  would be a nice shade of mauve  Everything worked fine until I
  installed SuperCDevBlaster and now when I use the Aldus driver to
  print from PageMaker d to a Linotronic  my system hangs 
  PS  I'm running System  on a PowerBook  
  
       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume we
  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the
  table of contents for the other pieces of it check any other
  relevant online resources listed below in question  especially
  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups and RTFM Read
  the Friendly Manual before posting your question  We realize that
  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen
  of your newlyinstalled twenty megs of RAM but this question has
  already made its way around the world three hundred times before
  and it's developing tired feet  Finally before posting to any
  newsgroup Macintosh or otherwise please familiarize yourself
  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup
  newsannouncenewusers


 HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT  WHERE CAN I GET IT   
     
         compsysmacfaq is currently divided into multiple pieces
  a general introduction which you're reading now and specific lists
  for the newsgroups compsysmacsystem and compsysmacmisc  FAQ
  lists for compsysmacwanted compsysmacapps and
  compsysmachardware are in development  When ready each part
  will be available in its respective newsgroup  All pieces are
  available via anonymous ftp from rtfmmitedu in the
  pubusenetnewsanswersmacintosh directory Except for this
  document itself which is named generalfaqZ the pieces are named
  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by
  faq eg systemfaqZ miscfaqZ  The Z means the  file is
  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use
  either MacCompress StuffIt Deluxe or the UNIX uncompress command 
  to decompress it  However if you leave off the Z extension when
   you get the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file
  before sending it to you 
  
         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned
  newsgroups  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ
  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to
  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere
  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand 
  It's not always obvious especially to newcomers where a
  particular question or comment should be posted  Please
  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh
  newsgroups before posting in any of them  Which questions appear
  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong
  where 
  
         To jump to a particular question search for
  sectionnumberquestionnumber enclosed in parentheses  For
  example to find Where can I FTP Macintosh software search for
  the string    To jump to a section instead of a question
  use a zero for  the question number


 WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE  

      compsysmacfaq provides short answers to a number of 
  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup
  compsysmacmisc and compsysmacsystem  Four other files are
  worthy of particular note Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list
  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup
  compsysmacprogrammer  It's posted to that group weekly and 
  available for anonymous ftp from ftpcsuoregon  in 
  pubmac  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list 
  for compsysmaccomm available in that newsgroup and from
  rascalicsutexasedu in macfaq where the file you're reading now
  is also irregularly archived  This list answers many frequently
  asked questions about networking UNIX and the Mac
  telecommunications and foreign file formats  Norm Walsh has
  compiled an excellent FAQ for compfonts that answers a lot of
  questions about the various kinds of fonts and crossplatform
  conversion and printing  It's available in compfonts or by ftp
  from ibiscsumassedu in pubnormcompfontsFAQ  Finally Jim
  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for compunixaux covering Apple's UNIX
  environment AUX  It's posted every  to  weeks in compunixaux

 WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO  
  
      There are no stupid questions but there are misplaced ones 
  You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite
  integral  of ln x between zero and one would you  So don't ask
  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft
  Word is in the background  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an
  excuse If you want people to help you you need to learn their
  ways of  communicating  
  
      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your
  mailbox with pearls of wisdom and maybe a few rotten oysters too
     Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering
  silence  For instance the most common and glaring mispost one
  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of
  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic asking a
  question about networking anywhere except compsysmaccomm
  normally produces no useful responses  Posting the same question
  to compsysmaccomm ensures that your post is read and considered
  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few
  network software designers
  
         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup  Do not crosspost 
  If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra
  minute to figure out where it properly belongs it's not important
  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading 
  For the same reason compsysmacmisc should not be used as a
  catchall newsgroup
  
         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in
  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs
  where  Specifically questions about productivity applications
  software you bought your Macintosh to run not software you bought
  to make your Macintosh run better should go to compsysmacapps
  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup 
  Communications programs games HyperCard compilers and databases
  all have more topical compsysmac newsgroups  Post questions
  about noncommunications hardware including questions about what
  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to
  compsysmachardware  Questions about MacOS system software
  belong in compsysmacsystem  Questions about utilities and
  extensions normally belong in compsysmacmisc  Questions about
  AUX go to compunixaux  Detailed questions about Appletalk
  belong in compprotocolsappletalk
  
         Direct questions about HyperCard to compsysmachypercard 
  NonHyperCard programming questions and questions about development
  environments should go to compsysmacprogrammer  ResEdit
  questions may be posted either to compsysmacmisc
  compsysmacsystem or compsysmacprogrammer but generally the
  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of compsysmacprogrammer
  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking 
  
         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY
  technical question about an application that actually begins to
  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's Recent
  example How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly
  compare to other word processors written in high level languages
  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup
    
         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to
  compsysmacwanted and miscforsalecomputersmac ONLY  We
  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded K Mac to
  get the  for a PowerBook  but trust me anyone who wants to
  buy it will be reading compsysmacwanted  Political and
  religious questions The Mac is better than Windows Is not Is
  too Is not Is too Hey How 'bout the Amiga What about it Is
  Not Is too belong in compsysmacadvocacy  Anything not
  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in compsysmacmisc
  
         Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the
  compsysmac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions 
  Many questions about modems in compsysmaccomm are much more
  thoroughly discussed in compdcommodems  Questions about Mac MIDI
  are often better handled in compmusic even though it's not a
  Macintosh specific newsgroup  Shop around  Usenet's a big place
  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in
  compsysmac


  SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF
 THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND
 WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE

      No  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as
  frequent questions  Unless you really have something new to add to
  the traditional answers such as the recent discovery that fonts in
  System  could eat memory private Email is a much better medium
  for answering common questions like this one
   
         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your Email
  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it
  before posting future questions  I do read all the newsgroups
  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that
  lets me send PWFAQ's people with frequently asked questions the
  section of this document that answers their question with just the
  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to
  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they
  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it

    

  
 FTP   
 

 WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE  

      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware
  freeware and demo software are sumexaimstanfordedu 
  macarchiveumichedu  and wuarchivewustledu
   which mirrors the other two sites and several
  others Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove
  them for space concerns and still has files that were deleted from
  the formerly important site rascalicsutexasedu  Rascal was
  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the
  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives  Unless
  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document
  should be available at the above sites
  
       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable Scandinavians 
  should try connecting to ftpfunetfi  ftplthse
   or sicsse  instead  Those in 
  the UK should look first at srcdocicacuk  
  Continental Europeans can try nicswitchch   
  ezinfoethzch  and anlanlfr 
  Australian users should try to find what they want at archieau
   which mirrors infomac and macarchive  Japanese
  users will find sumex mirrored at ftputokyoacjp
   

         A fourth very important site is ftpapplecom  
  This is Apple's semiofficial repository for system software
  developer tools source code technical notes and other things
  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth  Some material
  at this site may not be distributed outside the US or by other
  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple
  system software  Please read the various README documents
  available at ftpapplecom for the detailed info if you're
  connecting from outside the US or if you wish to redistribute
  material you find here


 CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY EMAIL  

      The infomac archives at sumexaim are available by Email from
  LISTSERVRICEVMbitnet alternately listservricevmriceedu 
  The listserver responds to the commands MACARCH HELP MACARCH
  INDEX and MACARCH GET filename  Mac archive files are available
  from macmacarchiveumichedu  Send it a message containing the
  words help and index no quotes on the first two lines of your
  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files
  you may request  You can retrieve files from other sites by using
  the server at ftpmaildecwrldeccom  For details send it a
  message with just the text help no quotes


 WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X  

      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above
  sites try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it
  an Email message addressed to archie with the subject help 
  Archie servers are located at archierutgersedu 
  America archiemcgillca  the original archie server
  in Canada archieau  Australia archiefunetfi
   Scandinavia and archiedocicacuk 
  the UK and the continent  These sites index the tens of
  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp  Login as archie
  no password is needed and type prog filename to find what
  you're looking for or type help for more detailed instructions 
  For instance you would type prog Disinfectant to search for a
  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant  If the initial search fails
  to turn up the file you want try variations on and substrings of
  the name  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with prog
  Disinfectant you might try prog disi instead  Substring
  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross  To avoid many
  erroneous matches add a hqx to the end of the substring eg
  prog disihqx  Most Mac software available on the net ends in
  hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does 

         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE
  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware  If you
  follow the above advice you should almost never have to ask the
  net where to find a particular piece of software


 CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X  

      No  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from
  compbinariesmac that was corrupt or missed at your site  Please
  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about
  anonymous FTP archie and automatic Email servers


 WHAT IS BIN HQX CPT ETC  

      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to
  more easily pass through foreign computer systems  First they're
  compressed to make them faster to download and then they're
  translated to either a binhex hqx or MacBinary bin format
  that other computers can digest  The Macintosh uses a special
  twofork filing system that chokes most other computers  BinHex
  files are bit ASCII text files while MacBinary files are pure
  bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary
  protocol
  
         How a file has been translated and compressed for
  transmission is indicated by its suffix  Normally a file will have
  a name something like filenamexxxyyy  xxx indicates how it was
  compressed and yyy indicates how it was translated  To use a file
  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the
  process  Most files you get from the net require a twostep
  decoding process  First change the binhex hqx or MacBinary
  bin file to a doubleclickable Macintosh file then decompress
  it  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table
  below  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs
  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh
  files as they are downloaded

     A few notes on the decompressors

      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different
  compression schemes  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff
  all of them  Versions of StuffIt earlier than  StuffIt 
  StuffIt Classic UnStuffIt and StuffIt Deluxe  and  will
  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt  
  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt
  Expander 
    
         StuffIt  Lite and Deluxe consistently makes smaller
  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility  To allow
  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep
  netbandwidth down please compress all files you send to anonymous
  ftp sites with StuffIt 
   
         UUTool MacCompress and SunTar handle the popular UNIX
  formats of  uuencode uu compress Z and tar tar
  respectively  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac
  products so use them instead when that's an  option  Translators
  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also
  available by anonymous ftp 
  
         Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to
  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading
  them to a Mac Since UNIX stores files differently than does the
  Mac macutil creates MacBinary bin files which should be
  automatically converted on download  It can't decompress
  everything In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 
  archives   However if you need only one or two files out of an
  archivefor instance if you want to read the README to find out if
  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of
  itmacutil is indispensable  It can be found at sumexaim in the
  infomacunix directory

     A few notes on the compression formats

      bin  These are MacBinary files  Always use a binary file
  transfer protocol when transferring them never ASCII or text 
  Most files on the net are stored as hqx instead  Only rascal
  stores most of its files in bin format  Most communications
  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating
  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance
  they'll be downloading MacBinary files
  
      image This format is normally used only for system software
  so that online users can download files that can easily be
  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies  Instead of
  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies you can use Steve
  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on
  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive 
  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy so you should have
  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case
  
      sea x X  sea files don't merit a position in the above
  table because they're selfextracting  They may have been created
  with Compact Pro StuffIt or even DiskDoubler but all should be
  capable of decompressing themselves when doubleclicked  For some
  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard
  designation for selfextracting archives created with their 
  payware products SuperDisk and More Disk Space  Instead they 
  append either x or X to selfextracting archives


 HOW CAN I GET BINHEX  STUFFIT  ETC  

      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human
  being to copy them onto a floppy for you  If you're at a
  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to
  give you a copy and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo
  Sound chances are very good that someone at a computer center
  dealership or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt 
  Once you have StuffIt any version you don't need BinHex
    
         If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually
  asking a living breathing human being instead of a computer 
  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of 
  protoplasmic jelly you can probably download a working copy  of
  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system 
  
         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any 
  means other than anonymous ftp then I suppose I'll mention that 
  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by 
  far the hardest way to get it  Ftp to wuarchivewustledu and 
  login  Type the word binary  Hit return  Type cd
  mirrorsrascalicsutexaseducompression and hit return  Then
  get StuffItExpanderSEAbin  and hit return  Of course
  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt
  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this
  fails look for something similar  If you've ftp'd straight onto
  your Mac you should now have a selfextracting archive which will
  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when doubleclicked  If
  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first you still
  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac  Just make
  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe
  is sending in binary mode  If you need more details on the last
  step consult the FAQ list for compsysmaccomm and the manuals
  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software
  
  
  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX STUFFIT ETC FROM A PC  

       You can't  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable
  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac
  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp
  You MUST beg borrow or steal the necessary software such as
  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person  I realize this may 
  terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement 
  since you got an  Apple II in  but eventually you're going 
  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother  
  though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send 
  your mother out to get it for you  While you're gathering
  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world 
  of daylight please don't bother the net by asking this question
  again  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh
  programs from a PC or other nonMacintosh computer onto a 
  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs




TROUBLESHOOTING WHAT TO DO BEFORE POSTING WHEN THINGS GO WRONG 
 

         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific
  problems there are far more problems that aren't covered here 
  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking
  for help  You should probably also perform the tenstep
  preventative maintenance routine described in section four
  especially rebuilding the desktop  and resizing the system
  heap   Following these steps may  or may not solve your
  problem but it will at least make it easier  for others to
  recommend solutions to you

 IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM  

      Microsoft Word is crashing doesn't say much  What were you
  doing when it crashed  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the
  crash  The more information you provide about the actions
  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you 
  The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions
  preceding it Step  the easier it will be to tell if the
  following steps fix the problem  For example Sometimes
  QuarkXPress  crashes with a coprocessor not installed error is
  not nearly as helpful as QuarkXPress  crashes when I link two
  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already
  contain text  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug
  remains after a given step  The latter lets you go right to the
  problem and see if it's still there or not


 READ THE READ ME FILE  

      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and
  bugs in their READ ME files  Often these aren't documented in the
  manual Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound
  familiar


 CHECK FOR VIRUSES  

      Run Disinfectant or another antiviral across your disk  Virus
  infections are rarer than most people think but they do occur and
  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do


 REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES    
   
       For half a dozen reasons external magnetic fields
  improperly written software the alignment of the planets a file
  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain  This
  can cause all types of unexplained unusual behavior  Restoring
  from original masters will normally fix this


 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE    

      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file
  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous 
  See question  for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean
  reinstall 
  
         If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these
  steps chances are you've found either a conflict between your
  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the
  program  So it's time to


 ISOLATE THE PROBLEM    
 
         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem
  will assert itself  Here are the basic steps of isolating the
  cause of a system or application crash
  
     a	Run only one application at a time Occasionally applications do
     conflict with each other  If the problem does not manifest itself
     without other applications running simultaneously you can begin
     launching other applications until you find the one that causes 
     the crash
     
     b	If you're running System  turn off MultiFinder  If you're
     running System  allot as much memory to the application as you 
     can afford  Sometimes programs just need more memory especially 
     when performing complicated operations
     
     c If you're running System  turn off virtual memory and bit
     addressing  There's still an awful lot of System  hostile
     software out there including some from companies that really 
     have no excuse  Can you say Microsoft Word  boys and girls  
     I knew you could  Some of this software only expresses its 
     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken
     
     d	Boot from a virgin system floppy  If the problem disappears
     you likely have an init conflict  You need to progressively remove
     extensions until the problem vanishes  Use a little common sense
     when choosing the first extensions to remove  If the problem occurs
     when you try to open a file remove any inits that mess with the
     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first  If the
     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated
     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or if you have
     a lot of them perform a binary search by removing half of the
     extensions at a time  Once the problem disappears add half of the
     most recently removed set back  Continue until you've narrowed the
     conflict down to one extension  When you think you've found the
     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make 
     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem


 CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT  

      By now you should have a very good idea of when where and why
  the conflict occurs  If a tech support number is available for the
  software call it  If you're lucky the company will have a work
  around or fix available  If not perhaps they'll at least add the
  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release

    

  
 PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  
 

      You wouldn't drive your car  miles without giving it a
  tuneup  A computer is no different  Regular tuneups avoid a lot
  of problems  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to
  charge you  or more for the equivalent of an oil change there's
  no reason you can't change it yourself  The following ninestep
  program should be performed about every three months 


 TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  

      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more
  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a
  little time cleaning up your hard disk  If you're at all like me
  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for
  applications you no longer have archives of software you've
  dearchived shareware you tried out and didn't like announcements
  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no
  longer need  If you're running System  you may also have several
  more megabytes in your trash can alone  Throw them away and empty 
  the trash


 RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  

      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain 
  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension 
  in your collection  If you don't use the functionality of an
  extension at least every fifth time you boot up you're probably
  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes
  up memory destabilizes your system and slows down every startup 
  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month there's no
  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time  Cutting back on your
  extension habit can really help avoid crashes 


 REBUILD THE DESKTOP  

      The Desktop filedatabase holds all the information necessary
  to associate each file with the application that created it  It
  lets the system know what application should be launched when you
  open a given file and what icons it should display where 
  Depending on its size each application has one or more
  representatives in the desktop file  As applications and files
  move on and off your hard disk the Desktop file can be become
  bloated and corrupt  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac 
  Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with
  a clean slate  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than
  to defeat an incumbent 
  
         One warning rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments
  you've stored in the Get Info boxes  Under System  Maurice
  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments
  across a rebuild  CommentKeeper also works with System  but only 
  if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed 
  
         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and as your
  extensions finish loading depress the Command and Option keys 
  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild
  the desktop and warning you that This could take a few minutes 
  Click OK It will take more than a few minutes The more files you
  have the longer it will take  If you're running System  you may
  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop
   
          If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing
  preventive maintenance you may want to use Fifth Generation's
  freeware init Desktop Reset  Desktop Reset completely deletes the
  Desktop file before rebuilding it thus eliminating possibly
  corrupt data structures    


 ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  

      All Macs from the original K Thin Mac to the Quadra 
  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain
  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk
  such as which disk to boot from  Unfortunately this parameter
  RAM can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes  To reset
  it under System  hold down the Command Option P and R keys
  while restarting your Mac  Under System  hold down the Command
  Option and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the
  Apple menu Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter
  RAM  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General
  Control Panel you should now reset them to whatever you want
   
         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the 
  date and time but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is
  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this
  opportunity to reset it anyway


 RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP   

      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most
  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the
  bottom of their screen every time they restart  All these
  extensions and most applications too need space in a section of
  memory called the System Heap  If the System Heap isn't big enough
  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of
  it they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap
  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and
  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off  All this
  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance
  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac
  
         If you're using System  your Macintosh will automatically
  resize the system heap as necessary but if you're running System 
  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage
  all your extensions and applications  By default this size is set
  to K way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all 
  The system heap size is stored in the normally noneditable boot
  blocks of every system disk  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility
  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks
  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much
  needs to be allocated  If you're running System  get BootMan

 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  

      System files can become corrupt and fragmented especially if
  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them 
  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file
  corruption  I recommend doing a clean reinstall  Here's how

      Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks  
      Copy any nonstandard fonts and desk accessories out 
        of your System file into a temporary suitcase
      Trash the System file on your hard disk  Also trash the 
        Finder MultiFinder DA Handler and all other standard Apple 
        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser  These will all be 
        replaced in the new installation  If you're running or 
        installing System  move everything in the Extensions 
        Control Panels and Preferences folders into the top level 
        of the System Folder
      Rename the System Folder  Any name other than System Folder 
        is  fine
      Doubleclick the installer script on your System disk  Then 
        choose Customize  Select the appropriate software for your 
        model Mac and printer  You could do an Easy Install instead 
        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't 
        need that waste your memory and disk space
      Once installation is finished move everything from the 
        temporary folder you created in step  into the new System 
        folder  If you're asked if you want to replace anything you 
        forgot to take something out in step   You'll need to replace 
        things individually until you find the duplicate piece 
      Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 
      Reboot  You should now have a clean defragmented System file 
        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable 
        system overall


     DISK UTILITIES  

      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that
  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even
  causing data loss  Apple includes Disk First Aid a simple utility
  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems with its System
  disks It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftpapplecom in
  the  directory dtsmacsyssofthdsc  Even if you have an earlier 
  version you should get the latest version  from ftpapplecom
  and run it on all your hard disks
     
         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that
  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid
  though interestingly none of them detect and repair everything
  that Disk First Aid does  The three most effective for general
  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe  Fifth Generation's
  Public Utilites and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh
    A department or work group should have all of these as well
  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do 
  For individuals MacTools  street is about half the price of
  Norton  street or Public Utilities  street so features
  and ease of use being roughly equal I recommend MacTools
   
         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they
  can't fix  When that happens it's time to backup  and
  reformat 


     BACKING UP  

      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be
  done a LOT more often than every three months  The simplest back
  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies
  or other removable media  If you keep your data files separate
  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back
  up those folders which change frequently  Nonetheless every three
  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk 
  
         A number of programs are available to make backing up
  easier  Apple included a very basic full backup application with
  System   With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup
  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder
  onto floppies  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the
  Mac and MacTools Deluxe  include more powerful floppy backup
  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups
  
         Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive network
  server or removable media device to use for backups you should
  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux  street
  doesn't support tape drives and Diskfit Pro  street  There
  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD
  Backup from System   


 DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  

      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free
  space in the same place to write large files  Therefore the
  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be
  stored in different places on your hard disk  As files become more
  and more fragmented performance can degrade  There are several
  ways to defragment a hard disk
  
         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your
  files erase the hard disk and you might as well reformat while
  you're at it  See question  and restore all the files
   
         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for
  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place ie
  without erasing it  Although the ads for all these products brag
  about their safety once you've bought the software and opened the
  shrinkwrap they all warn you to back up your disk before
  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong  There are NO
  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the
  net by asking for one 


 REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  

      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use so a
  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data  You don't
  need to reformat every three months but when your system is
  crashing no matter what you try reformatting is the ultimate means
  of wiping the slate clean  Reformatting your hard disk may even
  gain you a few extra megabytes of space  Not all hard disks are
  created equal  Some can hold more data than others  To facilitate
  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks  
  megabytes is the average formatted capacity  Your mileage may
  vary  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator
  of drive capacity  When you reformat there's no reason at all not
  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk
     
         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to
  initialize them Most hard disks come with formatting software 
  Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup a minimal
  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY 
  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with
  their hard drives  Normally this will be all you need to reformat
  your hard disk
  
         A number of generalpurpose formatters are also available
  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like
  encryption password protection multiple partitioning faster disk
  access System  compatibility and even compression  Two of the
  best are the payware Drive and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition
   street for either  While there are one or two freeware
  formatters available none are likely to be superior to the ones
  bundled with your hard disk 
  
         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and
  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter
  what software they use  Otherwise disk corruption crashes and
  data losses are a very good possibility

Several weeks ago I described a problem with my Apple HighResolution
monitor and promised to summarize replies received by email To
recapitulate Occasionally every two or three hours or so my monitor
momentarily loses sync The entire raster image bounces down about an
eighth of an inch or so then rights itself This usually happens right
after I close a large window highlight a large area or do something that
radically alters the image on the screen Sometimes though it happens
with no provocation whatsoever

I have received a bewildering range of replies At one extreme was
a man clearly quite knowledgable about monitors who said that the
problem was that the  monitor's power supply simply couldn't always
keep up with sudden changes of the raster image the rapid change from
a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's
power supply There was no fix available he said because nothing was
really wrong I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that
it had to be endured

This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to
adopt an attitude of stoicism except for a reply from a  monitor
owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the 
Apple Service Technical Procedures Volume  under the heading
Jitter Correction The section describes a fix involving the replacement
of a capacitor the adjustment of a potentiometer or failing that
the swap of a circuit board

I would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had
experience with this sort of thing

 Sorry but other than my Trinitron everything else I've ever bought from
 Sony has failed Why did I keep trying Because I'm 'tupid

Aw c'mon I've got a Sony VCR a Sony TV both must be over two years old by
now a Sony camcorder five months old and of course an Apple  RGB
monitor with a Sony tube that I'm never going to part with And the CDi
drive in my monthold Centris  is in fact a Sony

Maybe it's a question of personal compatibility Maybe your body puts out the

Geez we are a Sony familly Our neighbor works for Zeinth and hates

work Now they're relegated to the old bit atari computer and atari

Several months ago I bought a  PB with external floppy AppleTalk
Remote Access a Kensington case and AC adapter with complete documentation
and in almost new condition used for US I considered it a very good
buy and am very cosy with my little baby now 

Murray

Put me down for a PB  with ext floppy AppleTalk Remote Acces
AC adapter and fresh out of box was used but buyer switched to 
on arrival and sold unopened box Purchased last October for 
Later I bought a used PowerPort V  bps internal faxmodem for
something like  I'm using right now Works great  

No real complaints I love my portable system got a color home setup
also Mac II Reasoning was that MATLAB programs at school and other
simulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours or
overnight to run tying up my Mac II I got the PB with fast modem
to do light work and ontherun stuff I figured I'd give it to my
little sister next year when she goes to college It's running System
 now without any problems Also I sometimes do DEC terminal
emulations with MATLAB on our university's VAXVMS nice thing that it
benchmarks itself as an average of  times faster than a mac IIfx
So the PB just does graphical output and terminal emulation not
too hard at all for it It was a FABULOUS setup     Weeee

By the Way all MATLAB software was on class accounts I was also the
TA for a class that used SIMULABSIMULINK We had sitelicense and
takehome thendestroy later siterelease licenses No pirating
there incase you're wondering Great Program 

Just like to add whatever future system you get you can almost never
get enuff memory Buy it while it's cheap  that is buy it when you
get the computer since it's usually cheaper than upgrading I ALWAYS
run out of disk space But I have a syquest on the Mac IIsi so I
never worried about space before Got several carts

Specifically I'm looking at getting a NEC CDR mainly because they

 Even better than that  how does a based Amiga  perform in
 daily tasks compared to my based IIci

 Answer except in a very few cases I get my butt kicked by the Amiga
 Sure there are other considerations but it goes to show you how
 proper design from the beginning in hardware and software can give
 you great returns  as well as showing you that if you don't have a
 marketing department to speak of no one will care how good your system is

I've had the same experience actually I love the Mac interface and any number
of the features but am sorely dissapointed with the speed I use macs daily
and am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department I'm familiar with almost
every model out there and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari
ST simply blow the Mac out of the water in terms of performance At this time
I would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the
advantages of the Amiga or the ST and Falcon but I really wish Apple would
get their heads together on speed  They could take a real lesson in
mulitasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too 

  I'm still happy with my ci but I don't understand why the performance is
 so bad comparatively  They could have done multitasking properly
 They could have done everthing else better  but apple didn't
 of course DOS  and windows  are nothin to write home about either

I just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does everything well
someday If I had my choice I would go with Mac in most aspects but add the
speed and superior MultiTasking of the other platforms

As for the original topic Trying to compare just the chip in a machine seems
almost worthless A fast  with a wizbang graphics accelerator will be
faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra Add a
graphics accelerator to a  and you really fly Of course add one the the
Quadra and then you're blowing the  away etc

 Oh well y'all got  worth for the price of 

I think mine was only worth

Hello out there

My Mac IIsi runs a Radius Pivot LE monitor with the PDS card

As I wanted to try to switch to  bit adressing i couldn't startup my Mac
anymore

	What is the trick to zap the PRAM so I won't have to take out the
battery next time

	Is there any trick that could allow me to switch to bit

	What does bit adressing bring to me as an user faster work

	Any chance to have more than Mb of adressable memory with bit
adressing

Thank you a lot for your answers via mail or reply

Subject    Mac II vi to be discontinued Good buy
Lines 

A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi
session compatible CDROM drives for what seems like an attractive price
 I've used many other models up to a II ci but this would be the
first I could have my own Mac Is it safe to buy an abouttobe discontinued
model such as this I'd like to yank the CDROM drive out put it in a
housing and share it with my PC Is this feasible The only info I have on
the II vi is that it is relatively slow MHz has an  chip with a
math coprocessor I want to add a nonApple portrait monitor and use this
machine for HyperCard stack design Is this a good buy or would I be
wasting my money I would appreciate some advice Thanks

Re Methods for attaching heat sink to processor

Go to Radio Shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound It comes
in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap  At
Radio Shack it's catalog number   It's a mix of
silicone and zinc oxide and conducts heat very well  Plus it's
tacky

Usually you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink and then
bolt or clamp the sink down but if you don't move your Mac gravity
and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold
things in place  Just make sure you remember it's in there in case
you tilt your Mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose  You
wouldn't want a loose piece of metal running around inside your Mac

        We are having problems with a bunch of SE's in one of our Labs The
fault is that the machines either bomb or freeze when attempting to write to
their internal floppies The internal floppies have been tested on their own
and are fine which means that it is a main board fault The machines all come
from the same batch

        The date code on the back of the machines is December 

         Do you own a machine from this batch

	 Has any user had experience with this fault

         Was it a warranty repair


Any feedback would be appreciated and I will post the results to the net

Actually the  is for the  MHz PowerCard not the Universal Powercache
The  MHz Universal Powercache with FPU and adaptor can be had for about
 still not a bad deal  I believe the Powercard is one generation 
older than the Universal Powercache and the one primary difference is that
the Powercard is machine specific while the Powercache can fit into many
Macs with the proper adaptor  Both cards are  based

I'm not sure if the hardware or software with the Powercard is otherwise 
different from the Powercache perhaps someone could enlighten me

I would also add that I called River Computer the other night and these
Powercards were going very fast

Enter game developers The sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games

The Sound Driver is pretty ok since it's fast Sound Manager used by the
book is useless Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has
completed
is out of the question for games with smooth animation It's too slow

Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more
sounds soon If you are trying to write a game you shouldn't
be using SndPlay Instead make a channel and use BufferCmds
to play sounds on it It works great You can add CallBacks to
the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting
empty Before it gets empty


The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager Unfortunately
System  supports it poorly making programs crash occasionally

The moral of the story is to developers DON'T CHEAT

Well I want my code to work on old systems too I don't know about sys

but at least on  there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes
channels to hang with no error message This happends when I keep a
channel open for long periods  necessary for performance  and play many
sounds stopping sounds halfway Callbacks seems not to be reliable
Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to
inspect private variables in the channel QHead I think it was and the
only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an
undocumented flag and modify it

Callbacks are very reliable I found them  reliable even
under System  I was doing continuous background sound with
interrupting sound effects on System  with the IMV
documentation

You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of
your channels of course you didn't get called In general if
you have problems with sounds working when you play one per
channel and then close the channel with the related
slowdown but then when you play more than one you don't
work then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a
channel possibly the same one multiple times This might be
because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with
a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to
the channel first thing before it plays Most sampled sounds
have this command at the start of them You need to resedit
the sound and remove that command then when you create your
channel specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the
channel's synth Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you
want You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's since you
are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks

Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it and the
sound manager doesn't work for games remember Spectre uses
it And it works great If Spectre can spare the CPU time you
can too

One little disclaimer There are some out there who say the
Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right I'm not
sure either way but I know for sure that you can make your
sounds work  correctly on every other machine using the
Sound Manager

I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments  
from the gallery about this How much slower does the program run on a  
machine without an FPU namely a PB versus a machine with an FPU  
namely a PB  What types of calculations get bogged down the most I  
primarily due moderately simple algebra integrals which can be dealt with  
analytically and plotting including d plots I don't do a lot of  
numerical work Would a PB with a lot of memory  and the very nice  
video port  be sufficient or should I really try to get an FPU for this  
type of work Is a PB with Mb faster than a PB with  or Mb

We want to be able to communicate with a database on the computer using DTMF
and the telephone interface  It would be nice if the telephone interface
came with a set of library routines preferably in C which we could use to
write our own programs

We would also like to be able to record and playback voice using the
computer's hard disk for storage

Does anyone here have any experience with or knowledge of any products
which might meet our needs

Please reply via EMail and I will summarize if there is interest

about an inch any direction

Two page monchrome monitor connected to Newlife accelerator and 
video board in an SE At the end of the work day several hours
with power on the picture will occasionally jitter a couple of times
and then remain calm for a few minutes Then it does more shaking

The environment around the computer appears to be stable Nothing
newly introduced near the computer 

Any ideas Please email to carsonasfuca or reply here

Also Has anyone used Ehman two page with Powerbook video What
was required Just a cable adapter

Thanks for any help

no help from Datadesk I called MacConnection tech support  They tried it out
on their Centris  and had the same problem  They immediately offered
to get a new keyboard try it on their Centris and ship it to me
overnight if it worked  I could send them my keyboard back after I
got the one that worked  This is from a guy in Tech support named Dave
It turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face
before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing commandoption  I really like
this keyboard so I was glad to be able to keep it  On the other hand
Datadesks tech support sucks while MacConnection's is great

According to MacWeek of 

The Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra
 while the Tempest will share the lowslung case of the Centris
 Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted
above the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take
pictures of objects or documents Taking advantage of the bit
digital signal processor DSP built into the systems' logic boards
the camera will be able to put an image measuring  by  pixels
with  gray levels on the screen

Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record
detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit The camera
is expected to cost between  and 

The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's
Casper voicerecognition technology to work users apparently will have
to purchase an operational highfidelity microphone

The two models will talk as well as listen A new system facility
called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by
applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer

The Cyclone will include a MHz ' three NuBus slots and support
for up to MB of RAM The Tempest will use a MHz LC lacking an
FPU and hold up to MB of RAM it will have a single slot that will
require a NuBus adapter and have room for only inch NuBus cards
Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the
Cyclone's

REPOST  DUE TO NET PROBLEMS

Hi
   I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROM
revision  I had reports that this Mac was having trouble 
formatting disks and by the time I got to it the FDHD just would
not respond although all other functions were fine

I checked the voltages on the DB external drive connector and pin
 showed no volts with  and  giving volts unloaded The power 
supply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair

With the power supply reinstalled I now get the following error

With the internal FDHD connected the Mac boots fine but on completion
of boot cycle an alert displays The disk is unreadable  do you
want to eject it For every combination of response the alert 
reappears within approx  seconds and this error is continuous The
FDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable
of ejecting the disk This error sequence occurs regardless of whether
there is a floppy in the drive or not Pin  on the DB external 
connector shows V pins  and  show V

With the internal FDHD disconnected the Mac boots fine and works great 
MacEKG reports no errors The DB external connector now shows
no voltage on pin  but pins  and  show V

Now the internal FDHD may be fubar but I have an apple K external
drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when
connected to either the external DB or the internal connector at J
after suitable surgery to the external drive The voltages at J 
with the internal FDHD disconnected are as follows

	PIN	Volts	PIN	Volts
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				

This machine has a SWIM which I don't think EKG tests I have tested all
diodes and pica fuses and can find no problems Does anybody have any
ideas

   So I finally decided to risk this upgrade FAQ in hand I've gathered
the
 pieces together  The only problem is that I haven't been able to find
 anyone who's even heard of thermal tapeglue which is what the FAQ
 recommends for attaching the heat sink  I am just tempted to use duct
 tape here anyone hae any ideas for me for attaching the heat sink to
 the processor  much thanks

Just use a thin film of epoxy  Thats what I did  Epoxy conducts heat
fairly well  And my heat sink gets warm to prove it  I looked for the
stuff myself  my local EE jocks said to use epoxy

Have fun

  Yes I know computers and harddisk drives should be ALWAYS on But what about
  monitors They generate a lots of heat Should I or shouldn't I keep them on
   hours a day Any advice Thanks Take carePaul
 
 There has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement  True
 there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage but
 the internal power supply is wellprotected I've turned my Mac on and off 
 six or seven times a day for three years without problem  The monitor is
 the same  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity  twice as much
 as a television possibly more
 
 Turn it off when you're not using it  It'll save you money and the world
 a few more resources

The problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to
the power surge at start up  It is due to thermal fatigue  You turn on
your computer it heats up and everything expands  You turn it off it
cools off and everything contracts  There is a limited number of cycles
of this that any component can take before it fails  Modern electronics
are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors  In fact
portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function
that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal
cycles that occur  As a rule of thumb if I am not going to use my
computer and this includes the monitor in the next  hours I turn it
off I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the
phosphor  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in
the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue
life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular
architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors

OK if I post where this comes from will people stop sending email 
asking where I negotiated the deal 

The deal is from International Computer and Networking in CA
I saw the ad int he back of MacWorld and MacUser
phone number is  and the deal may have changed since
a few weeks ago since they change prices about every ten minutes 

Alas this is a funny system it SOUNDS like a good deal but this is a 
Centris  MB on the motherboard MB SIMM MB HD NO ETHERNET
and NO COPROCESSOR well actually it's a LC instead of a RC
'just had to say that to keep people from saying there is no such thing
as an ' without a coprocessor since the FPU is built into the chip

OK there ya have it but if I were you I would wait untill the cyclones
come out and buy a Quadra

Anyone happen to know what the max resolution for quicktime is  I'm 
trying to determine if a maxed out system using quicktime could produce
and edit broadcast quality video including bringing the video in via
video spigotetc  So far I have yet to see anything that's even close
to SVHS in quicktime but it'd be great to hear that it's possible

Thanks for the help

ECIt was called the Mac XL when Sculley came on board I bought one at
a closeout place after the Mac Plus and the awesome meg serial hard
drive were introduced To pacify people who bought the XL and only found
it was discontinued within a year Apple sent people like I a letter
saying for  and the XL they would give me a meg Mac Plus with
the HD

The Lisa was originally introduced in  or ' I forget now and
sold for  with  k floppy drives and Mb memory It didn't do
too well grin

Before becoming the Mac XL it was called a Lisa  It had a built in
meg HD by this time and was expandable to Mb RAM although that's not
what the  in  stood for It was the second coming of the Lisa It
also predated the Mac Plus AND the Mb serial HD by quite a few months
For a short while it WAS the power users system

We just received an AppleOne Color Scanner for our lab  However
I am having trouble getting reasonable scanned output when printing 
a scanned photo on a LaserWriter IIg I have tried scanning at a 
higher resolution and the display on the screen appears very nice  
However the printed version is coming out ugly  

Is this due to the resolution capabilities of the printer  Or are 
there tricks involved to get better quality   Or should we be 
getting something like PhotoShop to pretty up the image
I will appreciate any suggestions

Thanks in advance

 So is  a good deal or not I still don't know
 I would say that is not a good deal  In June's MacWorld River
 formerly Maya computer advertised a DayStar  MHz PowerCache WITH

 but geeze
 
Actually the  is for the  MHz PowerCard not the Universal Powercache
The  MHz Universal Powercache with FPU and adaptor can be had for about
 still not a bad deal  I believe the Powercard is one generation 
older than the Universal Powercache and the one primary difference is that
the Powercard is machine specific while the Powercache can fit into many
Macs with the proper adaptor  Both cards are  based

I'm not sure if the hardware or software with the Powercard is otherwise 
different from the Powercache perhaps someone could enlighten me

I would also add that I called River Computer the other night and these
Powercards were going very fast

As a side note in that same ad MacWorld  they are selling the MHz

to the   MHz Turbo an upgrade costs  direct from Daystar this comes
out to  about  cheaper than what most mailorder companies charge

one of the hardware types at Digital Eclipse He says that they run
tests on all of the components to see if they will perform at the
upgraded speed If they do not then DESI replaces them with ones that

    Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your
electric bill when you are looking at your computer setup especially
if you have a large  or greater color monitor Generally what I do
is leave my Mac on all the time except for the occasional resart or
syetem crash but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my
office I also turn off After Dark when I do this since there is no
reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being
displyed on the monitor's tube

Actually I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day

    Really What makes you think this The Q file server in my office
has been on for the last  months straight and it hasn't had any
problems Note I also keep the monitor for the file server turned off
when I'm not actually working on the server itself

Hello

I have a SE and a Generation Systems bit PDS card for a 
screen
It worked great until I upgraded from  to  mb ram
Now with Sys and MODE or enabler it does not boot

a tech support person said the card does not support these bit
fixes

BUT when pressing the shift key while booting when the ext monitor
goes black after having been grey the system  SOMETIMES boots properly
and then works ok with the mb and full graphics

WHAT's HAPPENING

Thanks a lot for any advice
please answer by mail

  So I finally decided to risk this upgrade FAQ in hand I've gathered the
pieces together  The only problem is that I haven't been able to find
anyone who's even heard of thermal tapeglue which is what the FAQ
recommends for attaching the heat sink  I am just tempted to use duct
tape here anyone hae any ideas for me for attaching the heat sink to
the processor  much thanks

 Yes I know computers and harddisk drives should be ALWAYS on But what about
 monitors They generate a lots of heat Should I or shouldn't I keep them on
  hours a day Any advice Thanks Take carePaul

There has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement  True
there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage but
the internal power supply is wellprotected I've turned my Mac on and off 
six or seven times a day for three years without problem  The monitor is
the same  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity  twice as much
as a television possibly more

Turn it off when you're not using it  It'll save you money and the world
a few more resources

Hello

I saw this question posted a week or so ago but as far as I could tell no
answer appeared on the net What is the good oil on connecting the Apple
Extended Keyboard to a PowerBook The earlier questioner wonderd if this would
be too much of a load for the PB and as I want to connect just such a beast I
am curious

I haven't got a PB yet so I can't RTFM but I assume that a standard keyboard
with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet I read mentioned connecting an
external keyboard But is the Extended plus mouse pushing it

Any help gratefully recieved I will summarise to the net if necessary

Thanks John Collins

PS I am thinking of a PB but I assume that this would apply to all PB's

I had a bunch of problems regarding sleepwakeuprestart with the  when
I first got it both with and without the techworks ram  Finally it died
wouldn't start until I  opened the docking door which snaps open and 
the machine came up fine but with the clock a few decades off  Apple 
replaced the processor board

Now
  twice the machine has frozen no mouse action
  twice the machine has refused to wake up  Acutally the backlighting
    came on and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in
    but not with a good battery
    The first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery
      for  minute brought the machine back
    The second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until
      powered down for about  minutes  The screen had what looked
      like red horizontal lines accross it
    Both timse the file fax modem preferences has been corrupted
      according to disinfectent

I have removed all the fax and modem software and the third party memory
and am waiting to see if it happens again

Hello NetPeople

We have a LaserWriter Select  standard Mb RAM connected to an LC
III 

The print driver cannot find any Adobe Type  fonts or any TrueType fonts
in the System

The connections to the printer and the Driver installation are correct
but this  printer still refuses to find fonts and work correctly out
of the box

IMHO an Apple product not working out of the box is a shameful event

The installer disks for the printer install LW Select  driver v 
PrintMonitor v  and backgrounder v   on a System  LC III

Has anyone else had similar experiences with this printerconfiguration
because we really need some help on this one

Thanks

Here is how I modified my Quadra  for higher speed Previously I
had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU
but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds

Your mileage may vary The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted
before hand My personal Q has tested fine up to  mhz thus far
I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher
speeds

Parts

	Clock Oscillators  pin TTL variety You will need a selection of
	speeds beginning at  mhz on up The CPU will run at  the
	oscillator speed The original one is a  mhz unit I recommend
	getting a  mhz clock in case you damage the existing one

	   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey  for
	   less than  each Some of their part numbers are

		    mhz TTL Clock Oscillator part  X
		    mhz TTL Clock Oscillator part  X
		    mhz TTL Clock Oscillator part  CTX

	   Don't get the half size clock oscillators They won't fit

	   There are also CMOS clock oscillators I haven't tried one in a
	   Quadra They work fine in IIsi's
	   
	Socket Obtain a  pin socket which is in the same form factor as
	   a  pin DIP package Alternatively use  machined socket pins
	   from an Augat style socket Just cut them out of the socket

	Cooling Fan A very small  volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a 
	   must My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had
	   a fan built onto it It had a passthrough connector which
	   tapped into the hard drive power cable You should rig up 
	   something similar or risk frying your CPU
	   
Procedure

  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here

  Remove the top lid of the machine You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower Follow the usual antistatic
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this Unplug ALL cables wall and monitor power supply cords from
	the back of the mac
 
  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply Leave that alone The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release
 
  Look at the rear of the tower assembly You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive Disconnect all these from the motherboard
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it
                                            
  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

  Look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower A
    phillips head screw is at the base Remove it taking care not to drop
    it into the case A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here

  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly Slide the entire tower assembly  cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case

  Remove the interrupt switch assembly It is a strangely shaped plastic
    device at the left front edge of the motherboard Pull the middle
	rear plastic prong up and forward The entire device will release
	
  Unplug the speaker cable Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to
    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case
	
 Remove the motherboard form the case Lift the front right corner of
    the motherboard about  mm This allows it to clear the clear plastic
	Power light guide Slide the motherboard forward about  cm The
	motherboard then comes directly out
	
 Locate the  mhz clock crystal It is a small metal box near the
    CPU chip Note and remember its orientation The new clock oscillators
	must be aligned with pin  in the same orientation
	
	Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator Some of
	the pins may be bent over Simply desolder then unbend them Be sure
	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board
	
	I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task This is
	NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience The motherboard is
	a multilayer design with very fine traces  easily damaged without
	proper care
	
 Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was

 Put a  mhz clock oscillator into the new socket You could use the
	old clock but it has solder on its pins This may come of inside the
	socket and cause corrosion problems later I suggest using a new
	 mhz clock
	
 Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification
	
 Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place

 Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother
    board firmly Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard
	
 Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	 cm posterior of its intended position Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case
    Once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place
	
 Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE

 Replace the phillips head screw

 Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in

 Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount

 Reattach your cables and power cords Cross your fingers and turn 
    on the Mac It should make the usual power on chord If it doesn't
	something is amiss Immediately turn of the power and recheck your
	handiwork If all is not well you have my sincere condolences
	
	Hopefully all will work normally Turn the machine back off and
	replace the  mhz clock oscillator with a faster one Reboot and
	be astounded 
	
	You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding
	a particular speed is truly usable With my VSO a machine lockup
	might take  hours of operation to occur In the brief time since
	modifying my clock oscillator  hours I have not had a single
	problem
	
Good Luck to all who attempt this modification There is a small but real
risk but you could well reach Quadra  speeds or higher with less than
 in parts

ECIt was called the Mac XL when Sculley came on board I bought one at
a closeout place after the Mac Plus and the awesome meg serial hard
drive were introduced To pacify people who bought the XL and only found
it was discontinued within a year Apple sent people like I a letter
saying for  and the XL they would give me a meg Mac Plus with
the HD

The Lisa was originally introduced in  or ' I forget now and
sold for  with  k floppy drives and Mb memory It didn't do
too well grin

Before becoming the Mac XL it was called a Lisa  It had a built in
meg HD by this time and was expandable to Mb RAM although that's not
what the  in  stood for It was the second coming of the Lisa It
also predated the Mac Plus AND the Mb serial HD by quite a few months
For a short while it WAS the power users system

outright
Here's what my Mac SE system has

Mac SE  with internal K drive
 Meg external
External K drive
ImageWriter II with  color ribbon

Stuff that can go with it
I'm willing to include both of the  modems and the  baud modem
if the deal is right  Keep in mind that both the  modems are less
than a month old and the MultiTech modem sells for about  or so

MultiTech Multimodem II  datafax

Microcom QXK         normally will connect at only  as highest

Summary Results of IIsi clock modification poll
Keywords IIsiclockpoll

This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their
IIsi clock oscillator I have attempted to gather as many case histories as
possible to find some estimate of success and risk The number of replies
probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that
success rates may be higher than the previous  estimate  of 
machines were able to run at  mhz when no add on boards were present
This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with

Thanks to all who contributed to this poll 


Issues

	Speed  mhz to  mhz appears to be the norm for machines without
		add on cards All reported machines were able to use
		 mhz as long as no add on cards were present Several Apple
		Nubus cards were in use No machine with the Nubus adapter
		was able to go faster than  mhz One wasn't even able to
		achieve  mhz with the Nubus adapter in place
	
		At speeds of  and  mhz the startup sound is distorted and
		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported
		
		Note Unless specifically listed below machines were not
			tested with a higher speed clock to failure Hence
			the  mhz operational machines may well work at
			higher speeds
			
	Damage One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad This was
		repaired and the machine is operational One other
		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator
		during desoldering There is one second hand report of a user
		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron
		
		No reports of static discharge damage
		
		No reports of high speed operation causing damage
		
		Then again I also don't have any reports from users of
		defective parachutes
		
	Add on boards Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus
		Adapters Several other add on boards have been used with
		success See case histories
		
	Heat Sinks Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed
		These were often the TO style power transistor type Some
		used epoxy Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
		of cyanoacrylate glue There was also use of a clamp with a
		bolt through the hole in the motherboard

The CD external is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile
now  Demand for the units are high so they are pretty rare  I've seen them  
listed for around  at local computer stores and the campus Mac  
reseller  I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's

I had mention in a previous article that I was searching for the  external
drive  I did call Apple Catalog as recommended and they told me the drives
were back ordered until May   I placed an order anyways and two days later
I had a visit from Federal Express  Well you can guess how I spent my weekend
Of course I ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of PC Exchange
when you order from the Apple Catalog  You may want to check if they have any
internal drives

BTW an older version of GateKeeper I don't recall which version hung up my
Mac when trying to access a photoCD or audio disk  I got the newer version
which did mention a conflict with the Apple xx CD driver

On the more stupid side I've discovered you can use a  mhz clock and make
your Q as slow as a Centris  However a  mhz clock which would have
yielded a  mhz Quadra  Who'd want one didn't work at all

Hello

we need the code for decompression of Quicktime JPEG Pict files as they
don't conform to usual jpeg compressors which are available in source
The code should be in C Pascal or Modula The code will be used on several
platforms to view pictures over ISDN Perhaps a special hardware will be
put around it much less then a mac perhaps only a DSP with some support
chips
If the code is not available perhaps the algorithm is available to
decompress
them

Hi
I'm having problems tying to get a Sony DAT drive to work  I'm using
Retrospect Ci
and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a Mac IIci
which has
now unfortunately gone to another department
  Ideally we want to attach it to our Quadra  setup  I can't seem to
get the
Retrospect software to recognize the media at all  When in the Devices
dialog
it can see the DAT device but comes up with firstly 'Running' secondly
'Media Failure' and then immediately 'Contents Unknown'  This does not
happen with the
Mac IIci setup which simply says 'Ready'
  I'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some
solution I 
know some others who have had problems with DAT devices and their Quadra
but they have
a Mac IIci which they can use
  
THE SYMPTOMS
System software is  also didn't
work with 
  I have tried the following
  Turn off all extensions except Retrospect SCSI required
  Tested on a variety of machines  Quadra IIsi and LC at least
  Connected no other SCSI devices
  Tested all varieties of SCSI termination etc
  Replaced the DAT unit with a new one Yes  we got that desperate
  Read the Retrospect manual EVEN MORE DESPERATE 

Replies via email would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance 
I'll post any
solutions to this group

Cheers
Matt

The problem mentioned last is a known Quadra SCSI problem it was heavily
discussed last year and an Apple employee pointed out that there was a
one byte error in the SCSI driver routine for the Quadra's at least the

and   System  should not have that problem for most people the 
solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor  In my
case MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my
Quadra
 all that occured early last year

Anyone know if there is an updated driver for Sony DAT drives  I can't
get mine to work with our  see Sony DAT  Retrospect Problems
posted in this group but I'm also having problems with other new macs

I have replaced the osz to  MHz yesterday and no truble at all My Quadra now works at  MHz stable for more than  hours I have also tried a  MHz osz but after  hour my Quadra  died I am not sure what was the reason for that
but it is to risky to run it to fast Most of your Quadras  should work at  MHz without any problems 

But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade During my  MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again So once again do a backup befor you start

Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz

Very interesting are the graphics results Graphics  couldn't belief this but it is true Two points which my cause problems are the  MByte Ram solder on the board The are only ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with  MHz The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams I have the orignal ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o




wn clockspeed so they wont make truble

The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink I would say NO After running my Quadra for more than  hours the heat sink is really cool A  MHz  with heat sink is mutch warmer than the  in the Quadra so I didn't see any problems The room temperatur was  Celsius  F If you living in a area were it is hot  F  C and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side


Hope you will have the same success than I had

Besides the faster processor the  has SCSI  and as far as I know faster

We are having problems with our Laserwriter print drivers going bad on
various people's machines on our Appletalk network  On our network people
have   and  versions of the Laserwriter print driver  We have
been solving the problem by reinstalling the print driver but it is
timeconsuming and a real pain

The Printmonitor software also seems to go bad frequently  We have also
just been replacing it over and over it seems to keep things running

Does anyone out there have any ideas about what may be causing the printing
software to go bad  Are there known INIT conflicts or network conflicts 
I would appreciate communication about any similar experiences you may have
had or ideas you have

You could send me an email directly to karensedcorg

There seems to be some confusion about educational discounts  True Apple
has different dealer price for educational and retail vendors but those

Maybe but the end user price is more like     less  It is here in 
Canada anyway

	For what it's worth my experience has been that the educational
discount which my SO has taken advantage of as a teacher is roughly
equivalent to the corporate discounts that I'm able to get as an employee of
a fairly large multistate corporation which is usually at least as good as
what one can get at one of the discount computer chains eg CompUSA

I vote for turning them off at night  THe stress of offon is a little 
harmful so don't turn it off then back on an hour later etc but
turning them off for  hours or overnight is a good idea

The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight along
with heat 

We have a lot of year old machines in the basement that still work but
who cares they are off  hours a day

	I wonder how hard it would be ie what it would add to the cost
to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
some amount of time  This is pretty standard in portable machines and the
same kinds of tricks could be played spinning down disks turning off
screens reducing clock speed etc  The advantage of this over just turning
the thing off would be  you don't have to remember to do anything and 
the machine is still available over the network

	The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity
Certainly you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody
pinged you but you do want to wake up at least the CPU if somebody
logs in via a telnet connection

	I wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter
months that energy is just getting turned into heat  It may not be as
efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant but it's
not too bad  In the summer though it's a disaster  Not only are you
wasting that power but you're probably also running the air conditioning to
get rid of the waste heat

I need to add to your message
I have a major problem on my hands  I have a Rodime  series
ROT external hard drive  Rodime is out of business 
and not writing any more drivers  In particular drivers 
compatable with system   After talking to Rodime 
they recommended the following Hard drive manufacturers 
and their driver software that were compatable
 
SCSI Hard drive manufacturer            Driver Software
            
FWB                                     Hard disk tool kit
FWB                                     Hard disk tool kit  personal
La Cie                                  Silverlining  or higher
Casa Blanca Driver Software             Drive
 
If anybody has experience with these driver software packages please reply
If there is shareware out there I would like to get my hands on it  I would
much rather send a good developer the  or so because most of the software
I mentioned if purchased would cost    and  respectively

Thanks in advance

I have also moved on to a  mhz clock Thus far not problems I'm not totallysurprised as I've had Q run at  mhz CPU clock speed using a VSO My
 mhz rated Daystar QuadraCache got very hot at  mhz and would fail previously I glued on a piece of aluminum stock to the hi speed RAM chips and it runs

Well I don't exaclty know what should be done but what I do is
keep my cpu on and turn my monitor off when not in use  I do this as
much for easing power consumption as anything though  Turning off the
monitor when not in use has the advantage of requiring less RAM than
a screen saver but it requires more of MY memory to remember to turn
it off pretty easy to remember to turn it on though

I just put a MHz  CPU into my Centris   Now I have a math
coprocessor but is it possible to speed up the Centris to run at either
MHz or MHz

    Not without replacing most of the chips on the motherboard The C
isn't like the IIsi was meaning that the motherboard of the C is 
actually designeds to run at the speed of the CPU and not designed to
run at a higher speed like MHz but be forced to run at the speed of
a slower CPU MHz

I didn't see any oscillators on the motherboard like the ones on the IIsi's
motherboard  Where is the oscillator for the Centris

    There is more than one oscillator If you are talking about the CPU
oscillator chip I think that it is located under the socket for the

So what's the deal with the PDS slot in the IIsi

I recently purchased a Mac IIsi  I want to add a nonApple monitor to the
system  I was told that you could buy a  degree angled PDS to NuBus adaptor
card so you can fit a standard NuBus card into the computer

Am I mistaken or do have to buy a PDS monitor card specifically for the IIsi
I've seen the PDS monitor cards for the si but they seem expensive and I'm
not exactly made of money

Any ideas  Help  Clue me in

	I wonder how hard it would be ie what it would add to the cost
to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
some amount of time

I believe that Apple Sun and a number of other desktop machine
manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate
powersaving techniques  this is also something that governments in
other countries are likely to require in the future so expect to see
it  This may include the ability for the system to fully power down
the monitor via a controllable power outlet and power it back on
automatically  Is this a sell on screen saver software companies

Goals for idle power consumption have been set at something like 
watts for the system not including the monitor  don't quote me on
this

Note that in many businesses the savings will be substantial
especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems
Sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for
the night would save the company Sun itself on the order of M per
year  Putting other and automatic powersaving features in would
probably have greater than double that value

Given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and
home computers on getting faxes automatically getting email 
building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to
cut  off the national power consumption based on data I heard

BTW when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving
work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors
with the power switch on front  There was some indication that
monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate
lots of power cycling  This may only apply to the monitors we use but
might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch
in back

Does GX take the place of  bit QD or add to it Right now  bit is
kinda aesthetically a pain in a few places because of hacks upon hacks
to maintain compatibility with original QDI think of things like
where you have to cast CGrafPorts to GrafPorts and such It would be a
lot cleaner to ditch this entire mess and start overdo we get that

such The reasoj I ask is that it seems the prices for SVGA are lower than

mike



    having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes  at
least for the x configuration  you can get an adaptor called Mac
VGA Q from James engineering    and this will let you
display x and x if the monitor is capable  I think the
x requires Khz horizontal sync  I use this on my sony  
gives a slightly wider screen than the x adaptor

 I purchased x MB pin  ns SIMMs for my Quadra  from Chip
 Merchant I've been very satisfied with them in the past  Either one
 alone works but both together fail  I called Apple for advice and was
 told that there was a problem with Composite SIMMs  Only noncomposite
 SIMMs should be used with the Q  Chip Merchant confirmed that they
 presently sell only composite pin SIMMs  So Q SIMMs need to be
 both  ns and noncomposite

 MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs although many most  MB 
SIMMs are  pin SIMMs allow two memory banks per SIMM thus permitting 
the use of  Mb DRAM devices the same ones used on  MB SIMMs to be used 
for two  MB banks on one SIMM  I can't imagine that it would be cheaper 
to build an  MB SIMM using  Mb DRAMs as the  Mb parts reached and 
exceeded bit for bit price parity with the  Mb parts some time ago  
It's probably possible to build a singlebank  MB SIMM using  Mb parts  
this could cause problems in a Q  I'm not sure why you'd want to do 
this though as a dualbank  MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a 
singlebank composite one

  The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight
  along with heat
 
 	I wonder how hard it would be ie what it would add to the cost
 to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
 reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
 some amount of time 

Apple and several other manufacturers have already committed to a monitor
design that does just that  It was announced along with the new 
administration's efforts to cut waste and fuel consumption  I know that
in the buildings where I work gigawatts are wasted by unused alwayson
machines and monitors

	The Performas are made to be lowcost business solutions  The xx have

	Because they have no retail price you might be able to get a steeper

	As far as the monitors go buy rd party  Much cheaper

 there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage but

that of their mac counterparts

First of all I wouldn't advise wasting your time with Apple  They'll
treat you like an idiot and you won't get any answers a personal
opinion

The safest thing to do is match the SVGA monitor's scanning rates with
Apple's rates  I don't know Apple's video scanning rates but I use the
Micron Xceed 's rates as they're a good approximation

About cables you just have to go out to someplace like Fry's and get a
few MacVGA cables and try them out  I have a ViewSonic E  and I
use an NEC adaptor  Other monitors may use other adaptors  I also have
a Macx adaptor that tricks System into thinking the monitor is an

works fairly well

 	Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a

I asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my  on

trashed the message stating that most newer drives Seagates at the 
least can very well compensate for gravity  This means that a 
horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data 
integrity problems

So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on
its side horizontally

I got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side
etc and have used it like that since obviously designed for that
orientation However it doesn't fit under any of the clever
places I can think of to place it so I would really like to lay it
flat and put it under a low shelf

This is probably not a newer drive and it is only  meg but
when I bought it it was a large drive for an average user
comparable to buying a  meg drive today So is my old  meg
drive as fragile or not as a new  meg drive

Just curious

Subject Re Why the drive speeds differ
Lines 

The most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a
greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than
the smaller one If your running the drive on a Mac I would recommend a
shareware utility called Timedrive which tests seek SCSI throughput and
rotational speed This utility should let you know what the differences are
between the drives

As far as I can remember all you need to do to get your Deskwriter up and
printing using the  driver is to drag the driver itself either serial or
appletalk depending on your needs to the system folder You don't need the
fonts or anything else if all you want is straight forward bare bones basic
printingI don't have anything else installed and can still print on a

Hi everyone
      I'm experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing
on the HP Deskwriter Sys  Deskwriter driver  PowerBook 
When I print from say MS Word I see the message Spooling to disk
but sometimes nothing prints Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus
I see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded Restarting fixes this It
seems to me that HP Backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly and that its
status as Multifinder NOT aware allows it to do this without my being
informed by a message such as HP Backgrounder quit unexpectedly Have
you ever seen this problem before
        There may or may not be a related problem I have experienced
problems in putting my computer to sleep Choosing sleep from the
Finder menu sometimes does nothing Today on a whim I checked the memory
map and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded Restarted
reloaded HP backgrounder and I was able to put my machine to sleep as
usual Just a mere coincidence or is the HP backgrounder crash preventing
my machine from going to sleep
	Has anyone seen this problem I'm seriously considering the purchase of
a StylewriterII because of the poor quality of the HP software 

	Please send your answers directly to me and post to the net
	Yours truly

Has anybody heard about a thing called a MacWatch I saw it on TV a
couple of years ago it is a watch with a reviever and a transmitter for
your mac The practical upshot is that your Mac can page your watch and
display a small message My flatmate is off to the states for a week or
two soon and I am interested in getting one Any info would be

I have a SE and a Generation Systems bit PDS card for a

It worked great until I upgraded from  to  mb ram
Now with Sys and MODE or enabler it does not boot

a tech support person said the card does not support these bit
fixes

I guess he is right Early versions of the RasterOps cards did not either
but they fixed it and people with problems can get a free ROM upgrade
from RasterOps

BUT when pressing the shift key while booting when the ext monitor
goes black after having been grey the system  SOMETIMES boots properly
and then works ok with the mb and full graphics

WHAT's HAPPENING

Very easy If you boot without the MODE control panel then it will
disable or rather not reinstall the bit clean patches So when
you run OK you must be in bit adressing mode Check About this Macintosh
and see if you havce a MB system

Thanks a lot for any advice

    Mostly The Q does have a SCSI controller chip as it's SCSI
chip but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI
modes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI
performance over the Q It does howrever have a faster IO
controller than the Q this is where the real speed boost comes from

 I just thought I would pass along my experience with APS I recently ordered
 an external Quantum  The salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable the
 order came when promised and the invoice was at the price quoted 

 Installing the drive was simple I didn't even have to read the manual The
 SCSI address is set by a pushbutton arrangement I daisychained the drive
 from my Syquest also from APS and booted up with no problems 

 I'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive It's a
 pretty good assortment

 The drivefan is a bit noisier than I would like but I think it'll be OK
 The speed seems very good although I haven't run any objective tests It
 also seems to spin up pretty quickly I can hit the power switch for it and
 almost immediately power the Mac without any problems booting from the drive

 Some observations the case is plastic good quality though while my older
 Syquest case is metal There is one LED which is normally green and
 flickers red as the drive is accessed

 Just a data point

Research has shown that the majority of the time that the United
States'  to  million personal computers are on they are not
actively being used  In addition  to  percent are left running
at night and on weekends

Computer equipment is now the fastest growing privatesector use
of electricity  Computers alone are believed to account for five
percent of commercial electricity consumption and may account for
ten percent by the year 

If you are one of those who leave them on after you're done it
would be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF
when you're not using it  It only takes a second or two to do

Also the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed
by the computer itself but by the monitor  If you can't turn the
computer off then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR

The US Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance
with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy
efficient PCs that power down automatically when not being used
and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation  These
new computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and
New Hampshire and save up to  billion US dollars in annual
electricity bills  Look for the special EPA Energy Star logo when
you buy computers  They should be available in one to two years

According to the EPA studies the energy saved will prevent CO
emissions of  million tons annually the equivalent of five million
automobiles  Also  tons of SO and  tons of nitrogen
oxide emissions will be saved these are the major pollutants
responsible for acid rain

Please do your part  be responsible  If you're not using it
then just TURN IT OFF

Here's the scoop

For the past two years I have been using an SE with a Sony s and
a Lapis video card  This past month I bought a Quadra  and am now 
using the Sony on it  My SE has been shipped home to my father who
is planning on getting an Apple  monitor The Trinitron one  My
question is this  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple
monitor  Does it come with two types  As I recall one can hook up the
power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my 
Quadra   However for my father's SE there is no extra plug which
allows use of the SE's power supply  He needs to plug it into the
socket separately  Sodoes the monitor come with a cable that will allow
him to do this  Will have to buy a different cable  IF yes where can he
purchase such a cable or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables

Thanks in advance

I have a Sony s whch I would like to hook up so that I get its 
power though my Quadra 's power supply ie if I had an apple monitor
I could plug the monitor directly into the computer so that when I hit
the power button the keyboard both the monitor and computer go on and
when I shut down both go off  Is there an extension cord type cable
I can buy which allows me to plug my existing power cord into and then plug
this extension cable into my Quadra

Any thoughts and comments would be appreciated

	Maybe you should contact your schools officials and make

allows the Unix works stations to shuts off its monitor when

If you're at all interested in this merchandise please email me

I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system so I have
two monitors and cards for sale Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces
I'm just wanting to conserve desk space and get all of my info from one
screen
 
I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas within
driving distance  like an hour away perhaps but I CAN ship to you if you
don't live near here Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes
for the monitors but I'm confident that my few months of fulltime service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction

Sony   color monitor

What's to say It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report It's a SONY
Trinitron arguably the best but I'd rather not argue that point
It's a great monitor in great shape but I'm going to a bigger screen
and although I'd like to keep it finances don't justify it
 
Still selling for  at MacLand where I bought it originally  not
including shipping will sell for  was  orig asking price
plus shipping Again make an offer if that sounds unreasonable
 
 
RasterOps si bit accelerated hardware zoompan  meg RAM

Renamed the sx a few months after I bought it this board is for 
monitors providing accelerated bit hardware zoompan NTSC mode
you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC and  RAM slots that use  meg or  meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM or a
RAM disk Software included for such functions  meg of RAM included  meg
SIMMS
 
Selling for  at Bottom Line without the RAM  add  I'm asking
 was  orig asking priceshipping included this time
it's just a card Original box and packaging I'd actually prefer to sell
the Sony monitor and this card together so if you want both drop me email
and make a bundled offer for these items
 
If you check the May  or was it Feb  Macworld mag you'll find that the
sx or si  same thing board did extremely well in the tests for 
 x  bit boards Also supports up to  or so x  in bit so
you can fit two pages widthwise via the scrolling desktop thang It's a great
board but I'm going to a  monitor and it can't help me there

    THe origional bit is missing but longshort follows

    The origional poster asked if heshe could use any old vgasvga
monitor with a centris hence title  

    The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes  You can use any
old vgasvga monitor with a centris  You do need an adaptor I use a
Mac vgaq from james engineering   to run between the two
machines  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a
three row vgasvga  pin adaptor for your monitor

    NOW the special interest disclaimer
 The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at x
resolution  IF your monitor will sync to Khz horizontal the above
adaptor will allow you to choose x resolution I prefer this on my
s

THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates  I would
advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue  As
to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because
they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue
    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A FKING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN
CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU
TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE the supposedly compitantly one AND
THEN STILL HAS NO FU CLUE

personal experience  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers
doesn't see to extend to Macs Sony Magnavox  In addition to this to
find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the
sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits
 that rate monitor resolutions give the most
favorable rating which usually means you can get this if you use a
specialized application video cardie well you can get a resolution
x on this    super smelly sock monitor that will let you
display TWO FULL PAGES side by side  All you need is our reasonably
priced oder eater video board for  and it will give you an
ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz
vertical



Note  with the sony  at least on the centris  built in video
board using an x adaptor there is a boarder of an inch  to the
sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as
possible  Using a x adaptor this can be reduced to about half an
inch

                                                                    A

Hi
Do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture  
Apple uses in the powerbook Duos  Or in the powerbook in general

What are the factors that make the Duo  so slow compared to a desktop  
machine running the same processor at the same speed MHz   How many  
wait states are in the memory system etc  What kind of a data bus does it  
use  bit or bit  

It's still slow when plugged into a DuoDock

Anyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when  
making notebooks  I heard of a DX notebook getting a whopping   
MIPS rating  A similar desktop machine should be getting about  times that  
I guess

We are having a problem with a Quadra  that has stumped a couple of
techs sent to us by the vendor as well as us 
This Quadra is 'stuffed' with Mb RAM Mb VRAM and some large disk Mb
I think What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time
the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync It is quite apparent that the
Mac CPU is still ok and the problem really seems to lie with the video
circuitry since you can still save your documents quit your aplpications
even pull down menus etc only the display is scrolling lik crazy so it's
pretty hard to hit menu items 
We had the original logic board replaced twice now and the same problem
has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has
varied The first board had this problem every about hr more often if the
cache was turned OFF yes OFF  This is the only symptom that is not
obviously related to the video circuitry after all the cache is on the CPU
right The second board had the problem every about  minutes we did
not keep it rather we put the original back the current board we have
has this problem a lot less often has gone about a week without doing it
but did it twice within an hour yesterday
The technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty
sharp and tried a number of sensible things most of which we had
previously tried ourselves anyway These included
swapping the RAM
swapping the VRAM
swapping monitors  different  Apple RGB and   Apple RGB
swapping cables
disconnecting HD and booting from floppy
sacrificing various small mammals
Here are some other facts
when we put a RasterOps ProColor  on the NuBus the problem is fixed
 it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out
the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards
 that exhibit it in our lab
Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards
 that they cannot find anything wrong with and getting them shipped back as
 faulty according to us
Here are some speculations
I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that
 much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously which may have something to do
 with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem though we can
 reproduce it with just Mb of RAM so this is probably a red herring
the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls'  claims that our
 walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation We
 have another  in the lab which works like a charm though it's not in
 the exact same spot Please don't tell me this is probably it I do
 not want to believe it
it's probably not poltergeists since they do not have badges to get past
 security at the entrance to our site

Has anyone any ideas Please Please email as well as posting cause I seem
to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less
time available to read news 
Thank you in advance

 What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple
 monitor  Does it come with two types

No  I recently bought an LC II with a  monitor  The monitor comes with
the type of power cable that plugs into the switched outlet on the back of
most larger Macs  Since the LC II doesn't have one of these outlets there
was an extra standard power cable included with the computer for use with
the monitor  But it was in the computer box not the monitor box  It's
not as if the cables are particularly expensive though   at the
most

   Hi

   I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this
   LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional  socket on the board
   My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 
   on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself Intuitively
   the math coprocessor should always be placed close to the CPU but
   I am not sure how good Apple's socalled processordirect slot is when
   it comes to throughout Does anyone know the answer to this or have
   any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter Thanks in advance

From what I've heard the PDS slot clock is only MHz to be
compatible with the old LC style boards while the FPU socket close to
the CPU is clocked at MHz

I guess a board designed for the LCIII can get a MHz clock from the
extended PDS socket

Is there an extension cord type cable I can buy which allows me to plug
my existing power cord into and then plug this extension cable into my
Quadra 

There are two approaches

 If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the
monitor most common you can get a replacement power cord that will go
from the monitor to the back of the computer

 You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing
power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the
computer

Both cost about the same aprox  and are available from many computer
stores clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at
good prices Power cords are standard so you don't have to go looking
for some special thing at a Mac store

I have an opportunity to buy a Radius VideoVision
board for about  of normal street price which
I believe is due to a change in the board architecture

I VAGUELY MAYBE remember that there was
some kind of serious problem with this board which
does Composite PAL SECAM to S video Composite
etc coversions Plus also generating quicktime movies 
etc MacWeek was generally complimentary about it
in the April th issue

Does anyone have any information on this board such as is it the 
one which has been superceeded what about an 
upgrade if so etc I'd be very curious to hear from you

It was a paper from Apple Sweden that announced some new products the new

Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines

The more of the story is to developers DON'T CHEAT
Really I am absolutely positively not allowed to do what I am about to

but I'm going say it anyway
Stop cheating on sound
Really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware The grace period
is about to end
The Sound Manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon so use it

Don't be silly

Using the Sound Manager on a Quadra is very well but using SM on
any of the lowend machines doesn't simply work for a decent action
game since it just steals too much time from the CPU This is
a fact By writing directly to the hardware on an SE it is
possible to have  simultaneous channels of sampled sound kHz for
a cost of approx  cycles Exactly how would you do that using
the SM pray tell

The correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can
carry that extra load using the SM means and to write directly
to the sound hardware on the machines that can't It's not the
politically correct thing but from the developers' point of
view it is

ECIt was called the Mac XL when Sculley came on board I bought one at
a closeout place after the Mac Plus and the awesome meg serial hard
drive were introduced To pacify people who bought the XL and only found
it was discontinued within a year Apple sent people like I a letter
saying for  and the XL they would give me a meg Mac Plus with
the HD

The Lisa was originally introduced in  or ' I forget now and
sold for  with  k floppy drives and Mb memory It didn't do
too well grin

Before becoming the Mac XL it was called a Lisa  It had a built in
meg HD by this time and was expandable to Mb RAM although that's not
what the  in  stood for It was the second coming of the Lisa It
also predated the Mac Plus AND the Mb serial HD by quite a few months
For a short while it WAS the power users system

 This Quadra is 'stuffed' with Mb RAM Mb VRAM and some large disk Mb
 I think What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time
 the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync It is quite apparent that the
 Mac CPU is still ok and the problem really seems to lie with the video
 circuitry since you can still save your documents quit your aplpications
 even pull down menus etc only the display is scrolling lik crazy so it's
 pretty hard to hit menu items

Are you sure it's not a problem caused by software  I've seen this sort 
of effect when a runaway program which could be caused by an INIT 
conflict for instance accidentally wacks on a register in the video 
hardware  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the 
Q just sit there in the Finder  You might also want to try changing to 
bit addressing yes I know you can't access your full  MB of RAM  
it's just an experiment as the video hardware registers can't be accessed 
then

Another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like 
QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display  This reprograms some 
of the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored

Subject Re Apple  GC Video Card
Lines 

 A friend of mine recently acquired an  GC card for his IIsi
 and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white
 I know there have been numerous reports about the worth of
 the GC but I was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little
 more on the subject  Any replies encouraged  Thanks in ad

I've had similar problems w other board types and the problem is NOT a
result of the GC board Try Zapping the PRAM by holding down
CommandOptionPR durring startup You will have to reset everything to
your previous preferences The Date  Time remain intact but the Video
Board will start remembering it's previous settings

I ordered an external floppy drive from them  years ago  When I placed
the order they said it was in stock and would ship the next day  A week
passed and no drive  I called them up and they said they were out of stock
and my drive should ship in  weeks or so  Since I needed the drive right
away both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead I cancelled my
order and haven't dealt with them since

     Since Image Writer LQ was discontinued there is no Apple Talk
     printer with  continous paper printer

     I would like to know is there are any possibility to connect
     an IBM compatible printer to an Apple Talk net directly or 
     with a Net Serial hardware and if I need any other software
     to do it

I've have not found quite the solution yet The following comes from
MacUser's MiniFinders

The Grappler IIsp is a dot matrixprinter interface cartridge that
emulates the Imagewriter LQs Includes networking and spooling
software that allows multiple users  Orange Micro  

If you find out any more information please let me know because in
the future I have the same problem or if anyone else has the
information please post Thanks

	Because they have no retail price you might be able to get a steeper

    Sears is probably going to have the best price around most of the

	As far as the monitors go buy rd party  Much cheaper

You may have been emailed this but the IIsi's power supply is not rated to
handle the GC board  Remember when the si came out and everyone complained
about it's power supply  This is one result of apple providing a lowcost
computer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end
computer at the time anyways that couldn't even support their own video
board  Even if this isn't what is causing your problems you might develop
one later

It was a paper from Apple Sweden that announced some new products the new
docking station was only one of them and the paper arrived before it showed
up on the price list I don't know if it's still called the DuoDock Plus
in the price list it could be a mistake by someone at Apple Sweden

    Ah Ok I didn't realize that you were talking about an Apple
division other than AppleUS AppleUS being the main division is the
one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and
configurations for the majority of Apple customers and it is generally
assumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple At
least that's how it has always been in this newsgroup All other Apple
divisions are apparantly free to change names and configurations if
they feel like it I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff all
the time It's not a mistake it's Apple Sweden giving a different name
to an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it

BTW when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving
work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors
with the power switch on front  There was some indication that
monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate
lots of power cycling  This may only apply to the monitors we use but
might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch
in back

I'm not an expert but having spent much too much of my life looking for
the power switch or the brightness control or the degauss etc etc
etc it is my firm belief that the only reason any

because the designers put them there deliberately

The most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a
greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than
the smaller one If your running the drive on a Mac I would recommend a
shareware utility called Timedrive which tests seek SCSI throughput and
rotational speed This utility should let you know what the differences are
between the drives

Larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent
bits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput  They also
have higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and
reduced seek times due to reduction of rotational latency

Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup

One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose Next time you power down the computer check that all cables are on tight

Wrong the CD external is just a plain ol' SCSI device

  The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession
    capability which I need

No multisession capability and double speed are two different thing  Its just  
that the newer CD ROM drives have both capability  Multisession means that  
when you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session the drive can  
read and display them  Double speeds just transfer ANY type of data excluding  
sound at around double the speed

  Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with say CD
 
CD is not multisession capable  This means that you lose the ability to add  
any more pictures after the first time must buy a new CD  Finally since the

He didn't go into details but mentioned problems with the
floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files
It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems
and software compatibility problems with the machine

He's not recommending the Centris  to anybody he says to

IIvx over an LCIII I don't know but that's what he said

Hi there
I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD I've been told
however that
 The double speed of CD is achievable only on machines
   with SCSI

This is completely false

 The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession
   capability which I need

This is also false What you need for multisession capability is
multisession capability  which is based on the firmware and
electronics not the drive speed I'll admit though that I have
not seen a multisession capable drive that isn't double speed

 Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with say CD

The above    proves  to be false

Any comments

The Apple CD is an excellent doublespeed multisession PhotoCD
capable drive So are drives based on the slightlyfaster Toshiba
XM Some companies selling such drives are Spin Peripherals a
bargain at  and PLI a company I hate and Relax Technologies
a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime
player in Mac mailorder which is usually a good sign The NEC
CDR is also a good choice NEC's own mechanism I think ClubMac
sells it for around 

Thanx

Your welcome ooh but now I see your from Germany Most of the
mailorder info does you little good I guess If not
Spin Peripherals  
Club Mac          
Relax Tech        

Nothing wrong with the Apple though which is based on a Sony
mechanism and speedidentical to the NEC The Toshiba's speed
advantage is very slight  in average access time a minor plus
and  in data transfer rate a slightly more important plus

Good luck
Mark

My  is working great  I haven't heard of any problems  Sounds
to me like your dealer doesn't know what he's talking about  It's
pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the Centris  on the basis
of problems with one machine  Recommending the IIvx over the LCIII
doesn't make a lot of sense either  If this person is so convinced the 
is buggy have they talked to Apple about it or are they just assuming
it's a problem with all of them

As the title says all that is printed on it is NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS NBDMA
It fits fine in my Mac IIci and snooper gives the very same name for the
board  It looks like it has an HPIB connector on the back of it and
another connector on the top  rows by  pins  It also looks like
it has an Intel processor on it A Intel '

On an EEPROM there is a sticker with the PN 

Anybody ever seen or heard of one  Or better yet do you know what it does
We are all clueless here  Our last option is to hook it up to our HP
workstations and see if any smoke comes out

Thanks a lot

  Your source is wrong  The double speed CD is still slow compared to a
typical hard disk  The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the
CD  None of the current Macs even the Quadras support SCSI unless
you get a SCSI Nubus Card

  You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD  It's just faster
reading images off of a disk  I think that the CD can handle PhotoCD
but only single session  The CD can do multisession PhotoCD

A lot of the time when you're dealing with someone who has no financial  
interest in selling you the machine you get a lot of opinion as opposed  
to factual information etc  What it sounds like to me is that this guy  
has had an experience with one flaky Centris  and formed an  
allencompassing opinion on the rest of the 's  I've seen lots of  
people who frustrated me to no end because they refused to believe any  
other Mac Xyz would be any good since their experience with one  
machine with a Mac Xyz had been bad  Their loss eh

Datadesk to have it checked  They didn't tell me over the phone that
you had to wait before pressing the shift key to disable extensions
Actually they did but not until a day before my keyboard
arrived But a month earlier they were of no help at all

 Hi
 Do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture  
 Apple uses in the powerbook Duos  Or in the powerbook in general
 
 What are the factors that make the Duo  so slow compared to a desktop  
 machine running the same processor at the same speed MHz   How many  
 wait states are in the memory system etc  What kind of a data bus does it  
 use  bit or bit  
 

   Huh  Where did you get this idea from  I think you got this
backwards  The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop
machine by  and the rest of the powerboks I think the
explanation for this was that it can refresh faster in  instead of 
cycles I believe  Things that could affect performance would be
factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU which the Duo
doesn't have undocked  Extensions and background applications can
slow your computer down too  Real life differences in speed are likely
to be influence by the software you are running what kind of screen
depth you are running etc

Espen

PS  The Duo is bit throughout

have tried my friend's IBM hand scanner with the scsi box and
it works  See if you can get Logitech to sell you the scsi
box by itself  Warning  most of the cost of Mac handscanners
is contained in the scsi interface box so it could run up
to around   When I upgraded my old style scanner to
the new gray scale model it cost  they just gave me a new

work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors
with the power switch on front    

 This is a pet peeve of mine I wish companies would put power switches on the
 front of the equipment If my Apple monitor had the switch on the front I
 would happily power it off at night Almost every piece of computer equipment
 I ownuse has the switch on the back including external hard drives and
 modemswhy I hope frontmounted switches become the norm and soon

It is just extra wire and work to put the switch in front Usually the easiest
place to put the switch is wherever the power cord enters the machine and
people HATE power cords on the front I prefer a power strip

I bought a StyleWriter II a couple months ago and lately when I print
something I notice white lines or gaps running through the line being
printed  It's almost like the paper is advancing a smidge too far when
advancing lines  

I replaced the ink cartridge thinking it might be the problem but the lines
are still there  Has anyone else noticed this problem  What's the best way to
get rid of it

I have done several of these upgrades about  IIsi's and  Quadra  and
the best thing to use would be some sort of heat sink compound If possible
you should look for the siliconfree stuff There's a comany who makes the stuff
called Tech Spray their address is PO Box  Amarillo TX 

You should be wary in using most kinds of tape and definately don't use duct
tape  that stuff is for ducts

When using the heat sink glue or compound only use enough to fill the small
space between the heat sink and the CPU

I believe that that would be the same as a system error  Since there is no
error  then I would guess that it would be a  error Which is a font
manager error of error during font declairation

I would assume that the system that's on the floppy that you are trying start
up on has a corrupted font in it or something like that

I've turned my monitor on and off with the cpu running many times Each time
I wonder what I am doing to my CPU by directly hooking in such a high current
draw on its lines while it is running Does this put a substantial spike on
the power line Could one possibly lose data or damage equipment

My Centris  is working perfectly  There is one problem that I have
noticed  FastBack II backup utility does not work  The strange thing
is that it works with my friend's  most of the time however it never
works with my machine  I assume it is some sort of software problem and
not hardware related

It is a data aquisition board for the Mac II series  It is called

 Hi
 I have a question
    Which is the diference between Performa  and LCIII
    I want to know which is better
    If you know the specifications and the prices of this computers can
 you tell me by email to  rcvillabislugapuccl
    I'd like to know the diference between the apple monitor' and the 
 performa monitor too
 
 	Performa   Classic II
 	Performa   LC II
 	Performa xx  LC III
 	Performa   well nothing 
 
 	The Performas are made to be lowcost business solutions  The xx have
 bundled software modems etc
 	Because they have no retail price you might be able to get a steeper
 discount on them  Shop around
 
 	As far as the monitors go buy rd party  Much cheaper
 
 Brett
 
 	There's nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an
 intellectual conviction  Sean O'Casey in The White Plague by Frank Herbert

Hmmm that's not quite right  The Performa  is Real Darn Close
to the IIvx but a better buy IMO  I also don't think they are so
much a 'lowcost business solution' but a lowcost home solution
Why else bundle at ease among other things  Hardly a business
application 

What do you mean by 'no retail price'  Quite the contrary I think
The price is darn near the same all across the country  That again
IMO was one of the selling points of the performas  ie no haggling
required  Kinda like the Saturn car of the computer set  One
price medium performance ready to go

When I shopped for my Performa CD the difference between Sears
sigh Montgomery Wards Silo sigh Circuit City sigh and
Bizmart sigh couldn't have been   Why I chose one over the
other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who
went the extra mile when did you last hear that about someone who
sells Apples  Admittedly except for Montgomery Wards and I
suspect I was just lucky all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know
didly about the computers peecee or mac  But then neither did any
of the  Apple dealers I spoke with

If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from
Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long long time  Go figure
I'm real happy with my Performa  Oh and I bought the Apple
Performa Plus monitor vs buying rd party  Happy with that
decision as well  I walked in plopped down some cash and walked out
with a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas

 Actually I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day

Nope  I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as a
usenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour I run uAccess
and receives all my faxes

I do turn off the monitors hooked up to it  They produce more heat
than I want  it can be warm in my garage office in the summer  I've
got one of those handy power control centers  at Fry's to I just
flip the switch in front when I start or stop working

By the way this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by Apple since
their new Color Classic will turn off its own monitor after a certain
length of idle time

The first problem was the sound  I tried the M but then even the logon was

The second is really strange  First I kept mentioning that FC slowed down
all the time and took too long  Well I just logged on with extensions off and
I didn't have any slowdown  Also last time I was online I quit which
usually disconnects and quits  It disconnected but it wouldn't quit  I had
to force quit and then when I launched FC again it said the modem port was in
use  This is really strange  I thought it might have to do with fax
software  Or the restart could have reset the modem port a more likely
explanation  So any suggestions

disk size  If you could provide some prices too that would help  I'm not

problem that I have seen is that a couple of the applications I run are
incompatible with the 's processor cache so I have to run with it turned off
Actually the main thing I don't like it is that it doesn't have a software
poweruppowerdown and the power switch is DIRECTLY UNDER THE FLOPPY DRIVE  I
haven't hit it thinking it would eject the disk but some tired night I'm going
to be really upset with that design decision

In all no problems with it floppy and printing have been just fine  printing
is done across a localtalk net not a directly connected printer

So what does the net think Did the dealer just get one flaky
machine or did Apple send the C out the door too early
Is your C working just great or is it buggy too

My  is working like a charm In fact if 's are flaky I would consider it a great computer even if I had to return a couple to Apple to get a good one

I have a small network running in my dorm at school and I am kind of
worried about the length of the wires and the way that I have run it
I was wondering if anyone might have some schematic or at least some
ideas on how to make some sort of simple appletalk repeater  I'm not
so interested in making actual zones and zone names just a way to
isolate different branches of the network

Does anyone have any ideas on what could be done

Thanks alot

Hi I just test installed kanjitalk  on my IIci 
and got a black screen a way sick looking mac icon and when hitting the
programmers reset a tone sequence that I guess is the infamous tones of
death 
I was able to reboot off a floppy removed the japanese system and
set up the system folder on the hard drive to get system  back
Now have no overt problems with the mac
Any idea what caused the tones  I forget the numbers but fff comes to mind
If it is some self diagnostic why would an older system version catch it
and not  
I'll be moving up to  and worldscript byandby
Thanks in advance

  I had a similar problem with my StyleWriter I the original
Have you tried cleaning the print heads With the SWII driver it's
and option in the Print dialog box Sometimes I had to do it several
times to get the crud out Yes it wastes ink but it beats those
white annoying lines
  Another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big
black box It can help to get the ink flowing
  Good luck

Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup

One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose Next time you power down the computer check that all cables are on tight

Interesting delema for all those out there
My school is discussing installing a Mac lab of  to  stations for our Bio
 to  classes to do a study with pig disections  no joke  Here is the
deal We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a
disection via the computer or via the real thing  My problem is I was somehow
drawn into this project being done by students who want to go Mac but know
NADA about them being the man mac man on campus guess who they came to so I
wnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing
list  Right now we are looking at the C  and the vx  platforms
Ok here it goes

	We are using cdrom so ought we go with the internal Apple Cdroms
offered as options in the  and vx or go external It is a matter of price
and reliability the second being VERY important
	How much RAM  I was thinking  more leaning towards   What do you
think
	Ok called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard
extended is  Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time
great wear and tear record or is there a rd party extended keyboard that is
just a reliable  Price
	Printers  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the
Thermal Wax Tektronic e or i Probably the e as we are going to limit
access so we don't needed the i's networkability  So what do you think in
terms of color printers  Different brand  Kind Dye Sublimation  Ink Jet 
Price Companies   s  Also we are looking to get a laser printer or
such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing  The fornt runner is
the Apple Pro is that right don't have my notes here at  
Suggestions  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through
and they know nothing about it for the most part It has to be reliable easy
to maintain and economical ie not high priced paper cartidges etc
	Finally and this is my little dig into the Project What about netting
these things  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the
net but server  Individual ether  Forget about it it is going to be
astronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask
them
	Little more info I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot
about macs but this is a bit out of my league not to mention I don't have the
time to go and look for all of this stuff So I am hoping the collective
resources and intelect of the net can help Has before Shameless plug BUY

	Disclaimer  This post is not and will never be supported by my

In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 's

 has a Mb Simm and the other a  Mb simm
Both are about   months old bought from different vendors and installed
by different people 

Both computers begin crashing frequently locking up and ultimately the
Memory Chimes  Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen
and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer  In
both cases taking the machine apart taking the memory out and putting it
back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback  my
marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are
lopsided in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after
time they begin to move about  possible because of pressure on the
keyboard or something  

Anyway has anyone else had such a problem or solution  If somehow you
could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving

I've had no problem for the past  weeks by replacing my Mb simm with a
Mbsimm although this is NOT desireble solution

Please email any resp  andor post if usefull to the rest of the world

What would be a good platform for some fairly basic video work of the
following nature

Reading real video in for playbak in various app's  Minnutes in length
Basic editing features for said video  rearange sequences adding grapic
slides from something like power point etc 

I'm not to familiar with this stuff but would like a good system with crisp
performance  It's for educationalpromotional things so the video quality
should be decent

I'm thinking Tempest or cyclone Big driveloads o ram Floptical or Mb
optical   however I'm not to sure of the various cards and software
thats out there

Please email any responses

Yes the IIci has bit clean ROMs
 
Either model would be a good choice  Another option get a new IIci
from a dealer that hasn't sold out yet  Also don't forget the Performa
 which I believe is the same as an LCIII but may be packaged with
more goodies for a better price

How important is this How many NuBus cards do you haveplan to
acquire How much memory do you really need I've got a ci and
mb of ram That's plenty I also have a bit graphics card
on the NuBus  I'm a sucker for pretty picturesI think the
LCIII can have a bootable ramdisk in memory which a ci can
not have At least not out of the box

 The LC III would be new under warranty newer ROMs is the IIci
 bit clean and would have sound input  I also like the
 pizzabox case

The ci is bit clean I solved the sound input problem with
a MacRecorder But that's gotten to be a fairly expensive
solution now that Macromind owns MacRecorder

 Performancewise I have read that they are almost identical the
 LC III being a little slower

The actual difference is probably not worth worrying over
 
 So which should I get

Depends on the price you can get the ci for Educationally speaking
the   LCIII here at FSU can be had at just under  Add
in roughly  for a monitor Last I'd heard an mb LCIII simm
went for  

I think you're in a winwin situation No matter what you decide
you'll most likely be happy with it

According to what I saw in a store today the Performa  is not the same
as an LCIII  It only has a Mhz  while the LCIII has a Mhz 
Correct me if I am wrong because it is possible that the dealer may have
forgotten to remove the description that was next to the actual computer
Dealers who sell the Performa are known to have about as much knowledge
about Macs as I do about DOS machines

     having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes 
 at
 least for the x configuration  you can get an adaptor called
 Mac
 VGA Q from James engineering    and this will let you
 display x and x if the monitor is capable  I think the
 x requires Khz horizontal sync  I use this on my sony

I am using a NEC FG with my Centris  The cable adapter was provided by

 When the computer is set for  colors and certain operations are done

 appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open windows 
 These lines accummulate as the operation is continued  If a window is
moved
 over the involved area of the screen and then moved away the line disappear
 from that area of the screen  This problem is not observed if the monitor
is
 configured for  colors or a  inch Apple monitor with  colors is

 I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain  The problem has been
 apparent since day  but has gotten worse
 
Andrew
        I had the same problem when I bought some additional VRAM In my case
the problem arose when I set the color depth to  bit on a  monitor  The
problem was solved by sending back the SIMMs and getting different ones 
Someone on a local bbs I use said that the problem is with incompatible VRAM
chips and that Apple has some kind of repairtechnical note discussing the
issue

        If you've had the problem since day  I'd take the chips back to
whomever sold them to you and get good ones

Does anyone out there know how I would get started on writing a

 When the computer is set for  colors and certain operations are done
 particularly vertical scrolling through a window horizontal white lines
 appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open windows 
 These lines accummulate as the operation is continued  If a window is
moved
 over the involved area of the screen and then moved away the line disappear
 from that area of the screen  This problem is not observed if the monitor
is
 configured for  colors or a  inch Apple monitor with  colors is
used
 
 I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain  The problem has been
 apparent since day  but has gotten worse
 
Andrew
        I had the same problem when I bought some additional VRAM In my case
the problem arose when I set the color depth to  bit on a  monitor  The
problem was solved by sending back the SIMMs and getting different ones 
Someone on a local bbs I use said that the problem is with incompatible VRAM
chips and that Apple has some kind of repairtechnical note discussing the
issue

        If you've had the problem since day  I'd take the chips back to
whomever sold them to you and get good ones

 D I am going to purchase a Modem with a SR FAX capability Currently I

 D Concerning FAX  Do I need to be present when there are incoming FAX 
 D ie will the modem software recognize an incoming FAX and store the 
 D information Once received can I use Mac applications on the image

My telephone line seems pretty stable and I have the Supra as well  Works 
great but with every passing day I fall behind on how many great s are 
out  Zoom is out of the question from what I'm hearing  ATT has a great 
product from what I hear and the Sportster is really cheap now too

If you want to receive a fax your computer will have to be on but not 
the monitor and of course the modem  You can set the number of rings that 
will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with Fax STF software  
It's entirely up to you how to arrange that  I've had faxes sent to me 
which is great but I've been home to set it  I don't have a need to set 
fax receiving up all day  Also I hear there is a device that can channel 
all incoming phone signals for about   Rumor also that the phone 
company can hook you up with the same gizmo for about  if that's what 
you need

Best of luck and write back if you'd like more feedback

I don't know the answer to your direct question but if the Mac Superdrive can  
read MSDOS disks can it then you can transfer files between the NeXT and  
a Mac by using MSDOS formatted disks since the NeXT can readwrite that  
format  And if you're interested in transferring files you can also do it  
over the serial port using kermit

  Hi
  Do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory 
  architecture Apple uses in the powerbook Duos  Or in the powerbook
  in general
  
  What are the factors that make the Duo  so slow compared to a desktop  
  machine running the same processor at the same speed MHz   How  
  many wait states are in the memory system etc  What kind of a data 
  bus does it use  bit or bit  
  
 
    Huh  Where did you get this idea from  I think you got this
 backwards  The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop
 machine by  and the rest of the powerboks I think the
 explanation for this was that it can refresh faster in  instead of 
 cycles I believe  Things that could affect performance would be
 factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU which the Duo
 doesn't have undocked  Extensions and background applications can
 slow your computer down too  Real life differences in speed are likely
 to be influence by the software you are running what kind of screen
 depth you are running etc
 
 Espen
 
 PS  The Duo is bit throughout


Thanks for the enlightening post  Is there a Technical Note on this

The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac
but rather any of various workstations that use the
MHz such as old Suns or old NeXTs  I used to own a NeXT
 cube   

But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of
a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo I did notice an
extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after
installing system  on it  Why does the OS suck up so much CPU
power 

Also you're rightsoftware does make a HUGE difference  I
have the misfortune of using MSWorks on my Duo  When editing
relatively small K files cut or copy takes several
seconds often more than  seconds  This happens with power
cycling turned off  As usual MS software is maggotinfested
feces 
I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing

So what does the net think Did the dealer just get one flaky
machine or did Apple send the C out the door too early
Is your C working just great or is it buggy too

I've had my C for about six weeks now with no problems whatsoever
It's been customized with

  replaced the AppleQuantum  drive with a Connor  drive  

  installed a Tandberg SCSI tape drive in the internal bay which works
   just fine though Apple doesn't seem to be supplying front panel
   bezels w a standard  cutout  

It's hooked up to an Apple LaserWriter Plus and has no printing
problems at all tested printing complex Photoshop graphics

It has expanded VRAM and extra  meg SIMM no problems

So in sum I have no idea what this dealer is complaining about

 I understand that if I have a correct adapter then I can
use a vga monitor with my IIsi
 Are those adapters working with specific brands
 Is adapter for NEC or Sony working with other brands
 I will be using a vga monitor with IIsi for a month soon
 I don't have any clue what monitor will be

Here's the story

  The IIsi cannot supply a VGA output  However

 Some VGAtype monitors can adequately deal with the video signal
the Mac uses to drive the Apple  or  inch high resolution color
displayie Apple's own x mode

So if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi you
need a an adapter that converts from the Mac DB connector to the
VGAstyle high density DB connector but tells the Mac to use
it's own x mode not the VGA x mode and b a VGA monitor
that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac x mode over
the VGA x mode which as I stated in  above the IIsi cannot
produce

As far as a above is concerned contact

 James Engineering Inc
  Fairmount Ave
 El Cerrito CA  
 
 FAX 

They can probably get you the right adapter  Remember you do not
want the runofthemill MactoVGA adapter because it will try to
have your IIsi produce the VGA mode which it cannot the computer
will just fail to produce any video signal at all  Instead you want
an adapter that connects between the Macstyle and VGAstyle
connectors but tells the Mac to use the Apple x mode  Sorry
for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction

As far as b is concerned make sure to get a monitor that can deal
with a horizontal bandwidth of  KHz and a vertical retrace rate of
 Hz  These are the spec's of Apple's x mode  For comparison
the VGAstandard x mode uses a  KHz horizontal bandwidth and
a  Hz vertical retrace rate

The monitor will probably need to have autosynch'ing capability as
the Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes
in the PC compatible world

Good luck

ECIt was called the Mac XL when Sculley came on board I bought one at
a closeout place after the Mac Plus and the awesome meg serial hard

it was discontinued within a year Apple sent people like I a letter
saying for  and the XL they would give me a meg Mac Plus with
the HD

The Lisa was originally introduced in  or ' I forget now and
sold for  with  k floppy drives and Mb memory It didn't do
too well grin

Before becoming the Mac XL it was called a Lisa  It had a built in
meg HD by this time and was expandable to Mb RAM although that's not
what the  in  stood for It was the second coming of the Lisa It
also predated the Mac Plus AND the Mb serial HD by quite a few months
For a short while it WAS the power users system

Yes and one thing to think about is the pricing on the M harddrive 
configuration  When I got my lowly classic II the options were  or M
harddrives and it was clear that buying another M of harddrive space 
would cost much more than the difference in price between the two config
uartions  There is an analogous break in the LCIII and  prices and 
you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive  

Particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC which sets up a
severalMB up to  partition or if you are generating large files 
with DTP software or if you might ever want to check out a mac unixlike 
os like MachTen having the extra space will be helpful  when you are 
pricing used IIci's look at the harddrive size they come with and how much
it would cost you to add more storage down the road Might be a 
useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over M though
I must admit that I am such a packrat that within  months of getting my 
computer I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to 
because I was running out of space without having started using DTP stuff 
softPC or trying any unix os

 	I have an Ethernet card that i took out off an old LC The card

 	and there's another connector on it which resembels to phone connectors
 
 	My questions are
 	 Will this card work on any other model than LCserie  given that
 	it's a PDS card will it work with the IIsi PDS slot  I think there
 	may be a probleme because the LC has  bit wide slots
 It probably won't work with any other LC  The ones I have for the LC II
 are Rev D  No it won't work in the IIsi's PDS slot since it's a 
 PDS while the LC has the  PDS  The IIsi and SE share the same
 kind of card

  Ok i see Does Asante propose any upgrade for their cards  Do they have
  an email adress so i can ask them directly  Their Phone number will be
  Ok even if i pay the overseas call i'm really willing to know what to do

I thought I'd share a good experience too  I bought the APS Quantum  zero
footprint drive in May ' back when they still used two separate LEDs on the
front panel and the case was metal  While traveling with it it was in my
SE Mac bag on top of the Mac this past winter one of the plastic tabs
holding the front panel on broke so that the right side of the front panel
was coming forward away from the rest of the drive  I lived with this situation
until it became completely intolerable which more or less coincided with a
network shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take which gave me
some dead time during which to have the drive sent out

I called APS for an RMA  and got one with no questions asked about how the
tab got broken it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers 
though nothing else was damaged well except for the internal speaker in my
modem which wasn't that well glued down to begin with  yeah yeah I'm
never flying with my SE again  And when I called back to ask whether I
could send it in a little later rather than right away they had no problem
with that  even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA  by a
day they're usually good for  days  The front panel was replaced under
warranty and the drive was shipped back quickly I mailed it first class
insured on a Saturday by noon from LA to Missouri and it came back by Fed
Ex by Friday I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was
traveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon

The only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked
to in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data suggested that I take the
drive mechanism out and send just the case  Unfortunately I discovered the
day I was mailing the thing that would necessitate breaking the little
seal and thus voiding the warranty  Oh well

Well

    You can always try and find a PC dealer who sells guaranteed memory
I work at a company growing at  a year we have on order hundreds
of computers per year  It never fails machines come in with BAD SIMMS
Now for those of you who are wondering just WHY your PC or MAC just crashed
I can tell you I always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or
designed the software
    Well I don't think that way anymore especially with the results I
have gotten with replacing BAD SIMMS in my own machine and others at work
The moral to this story is to MAKE SURE your memory is good  I would
be willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either soft
or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it but every once
in awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell
   
I just got plain SICK of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine
just crashed and they lost thier work  In case your wondering or if you
haven't already guessed I work in an IS department  Service is a do or die
perogative in this line of work so the MORAL IS  HAVE YOUR MEMORY TESTED
with a SIMM hardware testerand NO I don't mean the simple little software
programs that you can run in your machine  SIMMS are complicated little
beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively

If any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices
which are not cheap write me back  They make life a little bit easier and
besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity
people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide

According to the official documentation failure to use the IIfx terminator
can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus
Whether this is your problem or not I don't know I have had sporadic SCSI
problems with my IIfx since I bought it I cannot connect more than three
devices fourth one causes major problems

First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system
If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive If it formats fine
then I would try to format it on your system with no externals If this 
fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repairreplacement

Hope this helps

 My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
 such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot 

  The LC family of Macs can only
  use PDS cards They are not able to use NuBus

 Ah but why  Can some technicallyhip Macslinger tell us what the
 difference is between PDS and Nubus  

 Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a
 Nubus card cage  At least Marvin's friend has not been able to
 locate one and neither have I  What is the fundamental reason for
 this

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages I'm sure I've seen
them advertised occassionally but I think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx
so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother

Of course it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive

NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing I have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments so there
is no problem building an expansion box

Apple uses the IEEE Nubus standard for their  bit backplane bus
I got this from a technote that I reada couple of weeks ago

Well almost NuBUS  anyway comprehensive bus contention between processors
is not supported in the current Macintoshes could be wrong

However I know for a fact from seeing the Cyclone Data Spec sheets myself
don't ask Macintosh Cyclone models will provide full implementation of the
NuBUS standard

Very interesting possibilities indeed

PS The  is not just a joke
Scott

For the most part this is a bunch of bunk  I've got a Computer Engineering
degree yet I've spent the last  years writing software that people actually
use  Moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect I received  job offers
upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were
year lower  My advice is to decide which classes and projects most
interest you and pick the major that allows you to take them

emt

	Well here is my  worth  Advice from a grad student

	I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me
The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and 
learn as much as possible about it  

	In my five years of education in this field though brief 
compare to alot of people I had to think about this kind of 
question a lot  Did I make the right decision in going into
Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or
CS  The more I go thru school the more I believe that this
kind of question is irrelevant  
 

        Interesting as I think computer technology is now
becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position
which must require a degree  I know of several people I work
with that make just as much as I do and they don't even have
a BS degree in comp sci yet they make  a year  They also
didn't have to pay  grand to thier local University either 
       I think computer programming is being reduced to a trade
practice than a truly specialty field  It will be even more
so in the future
       If your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you
choose CS as I did I suggest checking out the emerging field
of Software Engineering  The difficulties for example of designing
scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person
can handle  to  million lines of code all by himself
in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment
is truly a gigantic problemnot going to be solved any time soon
unfortunatelybut hey you could be the person that provides
the missing key for some good groundwork

	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one 
does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does
not like to program is really doing an injustice of building
and computer and making it useful for something  Everything
is interwoven and inseparable  CS CE and EE are all a 
part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other

	My advice is don't limit yourself but make a decision
based on which major will give you the best opportunities to 
learn  That of course depends on the curriculum at your 
persective school  I would choose a major that allows me to
explore as much as possible  Beside I don't know why the
school would make a student choose a major before herhis
sophamore year                  

	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you 
decided to learn all about the making of computers in which 
case you suffer a little more and go to grad school

	About the money  Don't look at the averages if you
are good you are going to earn more money than anyone else 
If you are a superstar programmer you will earn millions  
Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers        

Well if your like the poor slobs in the worldlike me you are
in no financial position to continue Graduate work right out
of a Top  comp sci school

The trick is to find some generous INC you work for to PAY for the
rest of your educationTRUST ME its the best way to goeven
if you don't get a TOP salary  Which I have always been a poor
slob throughout school but if you follow this rule BOOKSALARYFOODSHELTER
you should always have a computer and you won't go hungry

What else could a man want

and now I can't get my Mac to boot off of the hard disk  It boots fine 
from a floppy and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe but I 
cannot get it to boot from the hard drive  I installed a new driver so I 
don't think that is the problem  
	This poses a rather large problem  I only have  Meg of RAM and 
I need to run Mathematica which requires  Meg  I was hoping to use 
system  virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica  However I can't 
run system  from a floppy so I can't get enough RAM  
	Any suggestions Thanks for your time

Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup

One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose
Next time you power down the computer check that all cables are on tight

I remember a simple program that would play those chimes for you when you
clicked their respective buttons  Does anyone know where that is  This was
circa  I think

A quick search of the index at macarchiveumichedu shows the following as

He needs insert the MO before FileSharing get turned on and the only one

that the check Allow owner to see entire disk should be enabled too

A bad thing you can't eject the disk until FS is turned off

Hey All

We have an old  external HD attached to the Plus in our lab  It had  
given us flawless service until last week  The problem Someone in our lab  
has an old  that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an  
aftermarket SIMMSCSI setup Digigraphics SIMMer  the DB SCSI plug runs  
through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a pin  
rectangular connector  Well this guy had removed the back from the machine  
to put more memory in and had disconnected the the SCSI plug  Since the  
pin connector is symmetrical not keyed he may have reinstalled it upside  
down essentially reversing the pins on the DB  He came in and asked if he  
could try out our HD on his SCSI port it had never been used  Naive fools  
that we are we said ok  His computer failed to recognize the drive  Now  
none of the computers in our lab will recognize it  We tried Disk Doctor and  
it doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain  Could installing the SCSI  
upside down have wrecked the HD's driver board  The drive seems to spin up  
all right and unpark itself upon powerup  The events are too coincidental to  
attribute the problem to stiction

Any help greatly appreciated

A friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can
format a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a HD disk Apparently it
rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or something that allows it get
more space out of a normal HD floppy disk  It supposedly gets upto  Megs
so something like K I don't have the program  since I can't use it
and its supposed to be called something like FORM or something like that

My question is whether its possible to do this on the Mac and if its not
possible is it due to hardware limitations A developer friend of mine said
that it might be possible but he doesn't deal with this aspect of the field

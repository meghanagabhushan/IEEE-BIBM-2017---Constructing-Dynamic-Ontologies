Dean J Falcione posting from jrmstpittedu writes

When the Pens got Mario granted there was big publicity etc etc
and interest was immediately generated  Gretzky did the same thing for LA 
However imnsho neither team would have seen a marked improvement in
attendance if the team record did not improve  In the year before Lemieux
came Pittsburgh finished with  points  Following his arrival the Pens
finished with        and  points with a couple of
                          
Stanley Cups thrown in
      
It was at this point the Pens attendance was near capacity  out of  
sellouts yet they hadn't made the playoffs since   How do you explain
a th place team breaking attendance records when they haven't been to the
playoffs in  years  Mario Lemieux is the explanation IMHO  

You could make a case that the expectation of an improving team that
would make the playoffs is the reason 

Funny you should mention itthis is exactly the case I was going to make

But I think the reason is Lemieux
had a  point season and was the first nonGretzky to win the Hart and
Ross since   People turned out to watch him play 

I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans even if the team sucks 
But this is short term only I still do not think the attendance increase 
will last unless the team is a winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking
one  Pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support
them  If they suddenly dropped to say  points you'd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon  

Also the following year  the Pens had  points not  

Ok  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book 

They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario that is 
true  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing
this Coffey late in  and before they even had a playoff bound team
A doubling of attendance occured in  from the previous year  An
increase from  points to  points is not going to do that  The arrival
of Mario Lemieux is what did it 

You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it  But my point is that
it wasn't Mario himself but it was the expectation of things to come ie
a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey superstar And
before anybody jumps in and says I'm nitpicking and mincing words go back
and read from where this thread started

It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly
found an interest in Mario and the Pens  Was it gee Mario Lemieux is
amazing I'll go watch him play or was it gee now we've got a kick
ass guy on our side I'll go watch him play  I think it was the latter

 Similar thing happened in LA   Before
Gretzky's arrival about  per game  After constant sellouts  They
are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement
since Gretzky's first year there  How do you explain it  People are going
to see Gretzky  they certainly aren't going to see a winner they haven't
GOT a winner  They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than
they currently have yet they didn't draw as well then

I don't think this is accurate  The tickets sell but people don't go to
the games  I think this thread has already been discussedseason ticket
holders in LA don't always use their tickets  So in effect after the Kings
initial success following Gretzky's arrival  to  points same source
and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in
attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much  

Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable  I claim that since
Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitiveI also claim
that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler
dynastybut that's another story and included only because I don't like
McNall  Anyway  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky and
that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising
sales etc  But as I said when the Kings have been in there little
tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the
Forum even if the tickets were sold

I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky the player can transcend
winning as the major drawing power  

For the short term IMO  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team
will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky simply because they
make people around them better

But winning sure as hell helps  

Well at least we are in full agreement here

This does not make Roger's point any more valid but the Jets aren't

So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point couldn't resist

getting a HUGE jump in productivity yet they ARE getting a huge
jump in attendance  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne
They have the th best record in hockey it sure as hell isn't because
they are winning

Yes but they are doing no worse than last year  I think the same type of
reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people
showing up at Winnipeg games  It's difficult to predict but do you think
that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they
will maintain their attendance levels  I seriously doubt it because in that
case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without
Selanne

I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the 
CFLdid you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL  If 
that's the case then fair enough but if it isn't the case then I'm curious
to hear your explanation

The Jets use the breakaway pass scheme to create a scoring sensation
in order to generate interest  If teams score as many or more goals
against Winnipeg when Selanne is on the ice as Winnipeg scores when
he is on the ice then I can't see how his contribution can be described
as impressive  

Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne
on the ice can be blamed on himRoger he is a FORWARD  Winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway  Let's put it another way  John Cullen's 
is terrible  What's your excuse for him  That his powerplay points don't
count  Neither do Selanne's 

The object of the game is not to feed Selanne  it is 
to win  And feeding Selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way
to winning

Knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning 

Pat Burns wouldn't have a goal suck like this on his team

You're worried about Teemu when you have Glenn Anderson on your team

We DON'T KNOW what Selanne does best  We do know what Jet's management
wants  And again the object of the exercise is not to allow Selanne to
do what he does best it is to win hockey games

What he does best is scoreso I refer you to my comment above

As it is now Selanne
is a grandstanding goal suck  Did you see the way he parades around
with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal  You would think the
Messiah had returned

Nope didn't see it  I was too busy watching Foligno jump up and down after
his goal

I can only comment on the Kings but the most obvious candidate for pleasant
surprise is Alex Zhitnik He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman but
he's clearly much more than that Great skater and hard shot though wish he
were more accurate In fact he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away
that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest
disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with But at best he's
only a mediocre goaltender A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom though
not through any fault of his own but because some thugs in Toronto decided 
to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal Other than that the
award goes to Robert Lang an uninspiring Czech Robitaille could easily be
MVP but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the
league's premier defensemen and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the 
rest of our young defense it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer
goals than Hartford Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel

I would have chosen Alex Zhitnik for biggest suprise  They
did expect that he would become a great defenseman but I don't
think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his 
rookie year  His speed skating ability and puck control is
exceptional  he is the one to watch on the Kings

Well I gotta tell ya

last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nailbitter LET ME TELL YOU
It was a well played game by BOTH teams I thought but according to the
Don and Ron it was the an offnight for the Leafs and the Devils 
were outplaying Toronto Well I BEG to differ

IMHO Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did His
fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he
created reminded me of the Clark of old But not to take any of the
credit away from Gilmour

I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey WHY 
Well first look at their injury list which includes Cullen Ellet
Zezel Macoun Of course my question is thishow will the Leafs
fare when they are once again healthy if they are playing this well
so far

Second just look at their standings still second in defence
moved from th overall to th over in the last month haven't lost
at home in last  games  game undefeated streaketc
BTW am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shutout I can't 
remember him having any as of yet

Well as of April  we see that the race for first in the Norris
has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and
Toronto And the best game of the season will probably be their last
against each other is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to
see this one

Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN
Go LEAFS Go

TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that
Montreal will send  players   million including Vin Damphousse
and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia Phillie will send Eric Lindros
to Ottawa and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal

If this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa
gets to choose st overall  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary

Personally I can't see Philli giving up Lindros  for anything
They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away
again  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a huge draw in
Phillie  and that he represents a successful future for the
franchise

Ottawa may be better off taking the  players  from Montreal
for the pick

 Didn't the trade deadline pass two weeks ago

     Looking at the way the divisions were realigned there are six teams each
in the Central Norris and Pacific Smyth divisions while there are seven
teams each in the Northeast Adams and Atlantic Patrick divisions  The
thought occurs to me that inherent in the realignment is expansion of one team
in the Central division and one team in the Pacific division although I've
seen nothing published that indicates that

Actually when the NHL expansion committee was formed a couple of years back
before the Ottawa and Tampa Bay expansion John Zeigler stated at the time
that it was the NHL's expansion plan to grow to  teams  per division by
the turn of the century

 
Andrew Scott                     andrewidacomhpcom
HP IDACOM Telecom Division         ext 

During the Roman Era  was considered old

Last night during a Sharks' broadcast Commissioner Bettman was
interviewed during the first intermission  He made no bones about it
the expansion to  is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that
the current allotment of  are fully stable  This means that cities
looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until
one team in some location fails or looks to relocate

This is good IMO  There's no sense in expanding if it only means
more failing franchises are in the mold

B Stanley Cup Champion Vancouver Canucks
 
Sorry Pittsburgh in a walk
 
 Jack

First of all the Penguins WILL win the cup again  Who is going to stop them
Definitely not the Canucks 

My predictions

Patrick Division winner  Pittsburgh
Adams Division winner  Quebec or Montreal
Norris Division winner  Detroit
Smythe Division winner  Winnipeg

Wales conference champ  Pittsburgh
Campbell Conference champ  Detroit

Stanley Cup Championsagain  Pittsburgh

Canucks suck  They'll lose in the first round compliments of Winnipeg
and Teemu Selanne  

The Pens are almost unstoppable with Mario Lemieux

says
The precedent was set by the WHA in their first season  They used a red
puck for exhibition games and a blue one for the regular season
Thankfully they abandoned it in favour of black before the next season
began


One reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it
crumbled very quickly during play  The blue dye that was used somehow
affected the vulcanized rubber of the puck decreasing its cohesiveness

 GB has now risen from nowhere to Pool A in  seasons They pulled out of the
 World Championships in  and did not reenter until  when we took part
 in Pool D In  we hosted Pool D and won all our game to progress to
 Pool C In  GB finished th in Pool C and then last year we hosted
 Pool C again winning all our games Now after Pool B GB won all  games
 and in now in Pool A World Champions next year perhaps 
 
 
 Just goes to show you what using Canadians can do for a hockey team
 France Italy and now Great Britain all use a significant number of
 Canadians on their hockey teams

Yup Then again there are lots of foreignborn players on the Canadian
national soccer team so the Brits give something back to you in the end

For the record former NY Rangers coach Ted Darth Sator recently led
Lion Milan Jari Kurri's former team only the nickname's changed
DevilsLion to their second straight Italian championship They made the
European Final Four last autumn after losing to Swedish champs Malmo in the
semisand accomplished this feat using FIFTEEN Canadianborn players Mamma

They were and even if Washington might consider Patty a bust I'd rework
that trade in a minute  Druce has been a complete and utter bust here
only  goals

	Well Druce pretty much sucked when he was with the Caps He had one
good playoffs not season oh well The Caps are notorious for making
stupid trades anyway as can be seen with the Cicarelli and Hrivnak trades
Sigh
	In another note I'd have to say the Caps biggest surprise was 
Cote as many Caps fans had been expecting a lot from Bondra already

Hi  According to my always questionable newspaper there's a silver
dollar being minted in Canada the back of which commemorates the
anniversary of the Stanley Cup  Now I know full well what coins are
used every day in Canada  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket
change right now in fact  My question is since the loon is the only
dollar coin that I know is legal tender is this just a commemorative

Dean J Falcione posting from jrmstpittedu writes

But I think the reason is Lemieux
had a  point season and was the first nonGretzky to win the Hart and
Ross since   People turned out to watch him play 

I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans even if the team sucks 
But this is short term only I still do not think the attendance increase 
will last unless the team is a winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking
one  Pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support
them  If they suddenly dropped to say  points you'd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon  

I disagree  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the
crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well  Very few fans real
istically expect the Kings to do well this year although I do and yet they
still go out to see Gretzky  This is the marketing strategy  selling the
game by selling the stars  that is employed by Baseball and notably the
NBA and this is the attitude that the new BettmanMcNall leadership is 
bringing to the league  They have gone on record as stating that they are
trying to sell the game on its stars  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect 
examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet being
benificiaries of marketingoriented coaching strategies have goal totals
that would indicate to the casual observer the very fans the NHL wants to
attract that these players are indeed superstars

They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario that is 
true  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing
this Coffey late in  and before they even had a playoff bound team
A doubling of attendance occured in  from the previous year  An
increase from  points to  points is not going to do that  The arrival
of Mario Lemieux is what did it 

It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly
found an interest in Mario and the Pens  Was it gee Mario Lemieux is
amazing I'll go watch him play or was it gee now we've got a kick
ass guy on our side I'll go watch him play  I think it was the latter

It ain't nearly so simple as this  The casual fan doesn't think about much 
at all  Can you actually find an adult with a  digit IQ who believes that
McDonalds makes good hamburgers
 
I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the 
CFLdid you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL  If 
that's the case then fair enough but if it isn't the case then I'm curious
to hear your explanation

Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi
bilities has he  He was hyped initially as a superstar but outside of
one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintainenhance that assess
ment of his talents  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better
off without him

  Here we go again Is this the same idiot who posted the Gretzky
trade to Toronto   Sheeeesh  You should have waited until we got
over that one before this garbage maybe we would have believed it for
half a second NOT

   By the way I just heard from Mother Goose that Mario Lemieux was
traded to Winnpeg for Tie Domi

Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne
on the ice can be blamed on himRoger he is a FORWARD  Winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway  Let's put it another way  John Cullen's 
is terrible  What's your excuse for him  That his powerplay points don't
count  Neither do Selanne's 

Are you comparing Cullen to Salami  I would say that that is valid  If
Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami
stand around the other team's blueline when the puck is in his own end

The object of the game is not to feed Selanne  it is 
to win  And feeding Selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way
to winning

Knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning 

Excuse me  Are the Jets playing  hockey  Let me checkyes  but just
barely  They have allowed more goals than they have scored  Sounds an
awful lot like Salami's  to me  Sounds like they would be just as well
off  or better  if he played the solid twoway game that our friends in
Finland claim he is capable of  But if he did that he wouldn't be chal
lenging for the league lead in goals would he  The BiPlanes might be
challenging for first however

You're worried about Teemu when you have Glenn Anderson on your team

Now let's seeyou have compared Timo to Anderson and Cullen  Who's
next  Mike Foligno

We DON'T KNOW what Selanne does best  We do know what Jet's management
wants  And again the object of the exercise is not to allow Selanne to
do what he does best it is to win hockey games

What he does best is scoreso I refer you to my comment above

Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he
can play a solid twoway game  I would have to say that this style
of contribution would be more conducive to winning  Or don't you 
think so

As it is now Selanne
is a grandstanding goal suck  Did you see the way he parades around
with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal  You would think the
Messiah had returned

Nope didn't see it  I was too busy watching Foligno jump up and down after
his goal

I don't believe it  You did compare him to Foligno  And I honestly hadn't
read this far

It would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking  Your
contributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you weren't
trying to be merely argumentative

I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs biggest
surprises and biggest disappointments this year Now these are just
my observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an
opportunity to see all the teams the same amount Anyway
  
MVP  most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and
      in terms of leadership can't win without him
  
Biggest surprise  the player who rose above expectation  the player
      that may have raised the level of his game to a new height even
      if that new level doesn't necessarily warrant an allstar berth
      includes those players who at the outset of the season may not
      even have been in the team's plans
   
Biggest disappointment  the player from whom we expected more eg I
      picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on
      offence brought by Demers shouldn't Savard have done better

Okay you hockey playing fansfinatics out there I'm looking over the wide 
range of aluminum sticks for the first time I've been playing with pieces
of lumbar that seem to weigh alot and break after a few uses so I'm 
thinking of changing to an aluminum shaft so when I break the blade all I 
have to do is change it The problem is that there is such a wide reange of
models and selections out there that I'm not certain which to consider Can
any of you post some of your suggestions and experiences with the aluminum 
sticks What is the difference between models What do you likedislike about
them And which brands are best



I've had and still have a few aluminum sticks  I got my first when I was 
a Christian and broke the shaft halfway through the season two years 
later  I bought another a Canadian at the beginning of the next season 
and I still have it  I also have an Easton that a friend was getting rid 
off after giving up the game  I find that Easton blades are easier to get 
but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable  Watch out for 
dried up bits of firewood that some stores pass off as blades  In my 
experiences the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks 
but I've only ever broken one aluminum shaft

I like aluminum sticks  The blades are quickly changed even on the bench 
if you have to  On the downside the shaft won't break if you decide to 
impale yourself on it

Team                   MVP          Surprise    Disappointment

Edmonton Oilers         Manson         Buchberger    Mellanby

Well since the Oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games I'm not sure
they deserve and MVP can't win without him  However I'd suggest Kelly
Buchberger instead of Dave Manson who has had a brutal year his pick for
the AllStar game notwithstanding

As for biggest surprise I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations
this year due to his breakthrough year for him last year so he didn't
really raise his game  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein one of the
callups from Cape Breton during the year  He was quite far down on the
depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects but made a big impact on
the team  He has  goals in his  games and is only   Those are decent
numbers for a thirdline player who was seemingly doomed to minorleague
oblivion  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli
I think he'll be on the fulltime roster next year

As for biggest disappointment you could name any of the players the Oilers
dumped for lousy production this year Nicholls Gilchrist Tikkanen or
even Shayne Corson but Mellanby isn't far off

I was wtahcing RIGHT GUARD HOCKEY WEEK on TSN yesterday and they had
a feature on this guy that does a lot most of the masks for NHL
goalies  They talked about how they are made what they are made of
and the designs that are put on them etc

Actually this part was really interesting  It turns out that the mask is
customfit to the goalie's face  The goalie puts hisher face through a
piece of wood or was it plastic with a hole in it that allows only the face
and forehead to show  Hair is covered by a cap eyes are covered by a plastic
wraptype material and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face  Then a
plaster is spread on their cheeks forehead and chin which takes about 
minutes to dry sufficiently  When it dries it is effectively a mold of the
goalie's face  This is used as the basis of the mask the rest involves
padding the inside hardening the exterior fitting the cage etc etc  
John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show 

He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on namely a
new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic reworking of his current
mask with the bear on it and new mask for Bob Essensa which was 
really cool  the Jets logo was on the chin and there were two
fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an airbrushed
background

Yeah Essensa's mask looked really good
 
The best one of all was one he never talked about he just held it up
It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking 
black panther on the forehead  it has to be a new mask for Felix
Potvin but he never said whose it was

Actually I thought I heard him say that it was Potvin's for certain  I
would bet money on it either wayand it did look awesome

Before I begin lambasting Don Cherry let me first say that I've been sort of
a Cherry fan for a whileadmittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly
but he's moreorless harmless  On Saturday however he crossed the lines of
good taste

According to Don the entire article wasn't perfect and there
were some 'shots' by Frank Musil and Alpo Suhonen 
Don noted that Musil wasn't much of a player didn't
score many goals last year He also made fun of their names
One guy has a name like dog food the other like a laxitive
metaMusil

This is the best he can do  Gee Don tremendous amounts of professionalism
here  The CBC looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with
this nonsensemaking fun of names  It's bad enough that he makes asinine
blanket statements about European players but he's now resorted to making fun
of their names too  He sounded like an idiot much like he did last week
when he said that Teemu would never make it to his 'Rock 'em Sock 'em' video
until he dropped the gloves

On the subject of realignment Don said that he liked the
new division names

Well what he said was that even though he's been around the league for quite
some time he still doesn't know who's where wrt conference and division
names  HELLO McFly  The names have been around for a couple of decades
or sohe also invited the audience to Name the teams in the Walesquick
quick Followed by Ah you don't know I don't know  

Sorry Don  Wrong on this one

Ron to Don I don't know wy I like you on your show
for  minutes I can hardly stand you on this show for 

This was absolutely hilarious

Don's argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly
goodunfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in
the NBA case  Serious moneyoh well he's never been one for objectivity
has he

Don's question to Gretzky

Wouldn't it be better
for you to change your friends so that they like the game than for
us to change the game for your friends

Now this I liked

TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that
Montreal will send  players   million including Vin Damphousse 
and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia Phillie will send Eric Lindros
to Ottawa and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal
 
If this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa
gets to choose st overall  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary
 
Personally I can't see Philli giving up Lindros  for anything  
They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away 
again  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a huge draw in
Phillie  and that he represents a successful future for the 
franchise
 
Ottawa may be better off taking the  players  from Montreal
for the pick

To put it mildly  As I watched the Flyers demolish Toronto last night 
I realized that no matter how good the Leafs'  line may be they'll need
one or two more decent lines to go far in the playoffs  And of course a
healthy Felix Potvin

 The Adams division race is certainly interesting this year  Here are
 important data to keep in mind in the eventuality of a tie for a given
 standing position
 
 In head to head games
 Quebec wins over Montreal 
 Boston leads against Quebec  with two games remaining
 Montreal and Boston are tied  with one game remaining
 
               Pierre Breton   aka Fluide Glacial

Pierre
For purposes of the tie breaker you only count the first three games in
each city Therefore Quebec cannot possibly be ahead of Montreal 
and there's probably only one game that counts remaining between Boston
and Quebec which means Boston has probably already won

Subject Too Many Europeans in NHL
MessageID rausersfuca

   Ten years ago the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now Going into the  season the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats

Canadians 
Americans 
Europeans 

   Please note that these numbers are rounded off and taken from the top
 players on each of the  teams My source is the Vancouver Sun

   Here's the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team let's say the
Red Wings and the Canucks and seeing names like Bure Konstantinov and
Borshevshky Is this North America or isn't it Toronto Detriot Quebec
and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well 

    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the
Russian Rocket I will completely throw up As it is now every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will crosscheck Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher By the way I'm not a
Canucks fan to begin with  

    Okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians and
some Americans It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans who aren't even
better hockey players It's all hype This European mystique is sickening
but until NHL owners get over it Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league

    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating the problem is clearly
only getting worse

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent

    I just don't want them on mine

Obviously some reporter for the Ottawa Sun got taken by an April
Fools jokeprobably started by someone with the Nordiques or the

Like for examplewho is going to reimburse the Flyers for the
 million they paid to the Nordiqueslike the Senators are
going to get Lindros and  million  The Flyers sent the
equivalent of  or  players when you include the draft choices
to Quebec and they are going to get only four back

Some reporter was had real badly and someone must be having a
real good laugh seeing as how the so much of the sports media
has chosen to publicize this utter nonsense

If this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa
gets to choose st overall  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary


Can you thinkit cannot possibly be trueno need for the if

Personally I can't see Philli giving up Lindros  for anything

I don't understand why so many people are predicting an upset against 
Pittsburgh The team has won  in a row coming into the playoffs 
They've won practically every game that they've really wanted to win 
all year including critical victories against the Caps and one 
against a hot Bruins team at the Gaahden The team is probably at 
its peak stronger than the previous  Stanley Cup winners I mean I 
know they can lose but it would be a large upset I personally 
think teams are going to be hard pressed to win  or  games in any 
series against the Pens and I'm not a Pittsburgh fan


I have to agree here  As I heard on TSN tonight You want to pick
someone else but you just don't see how you can  And I'm a Bruins
fan  Maybe this year will be different but it doesn't look good
Time will tell though

of what it is now Going into the  season the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats

Canadians 
Americans 
Europeans 


   Here's the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL I am sick

You know you're absolutely right  I think we should round up all those
players of European descent and ship 'em back to where they came from  Let's
see with whom should we start  I dunno Lemieux  Hmmmsounds like he
has French blood in him  Hey  France is part of Europe  Send that
Euroblooded boy back

Sheesh

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent

    I just don't want them on mine

I don't think it would be hard to find some Native Americans or Native
Canadians for that matter who would dispute your claim to this great 
continent of ours  Ya see if you believe the anthropologists we're all
immigrants of some sort  If you really don't think that Mogilny Bure
Selanne et al have improved the NHL then I'm not sure you understand the
game

I disagree  I think the NHL should feature the best hockey talent in
the world  regardless of nationality  I have to admit that when I 
see players like Gretzky and Messier traded off to the US because the
Canadian teams can't afford them I have been know to say only half
seriously that we'd probably be better off if we had our own Canadian
hockey league for Canadian players

and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well 
 
    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the
Russian Rocket I will completely throw up As it is now every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will crosscheck Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher By the way I'm not a
Canucks fan to begin with  
 
    Okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians and
some Americans It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans who aren't even
better hockey players It's all hype This European mystique is sickening
but until NHL owners get over it Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league
 
    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating the problem is clearly
only getting worse

	Ah so now we're into European player bashing  What next  
No more French Canadiens  Yeah there's an idea  Let them French
speaking Canadiens have their own hockey league  We don't want them
	Are you CRAZY  The NHL is one of the true international
leagues and yes there ARE many Europeans who deserve to play in
the NHL and are better than some North Americans look at Teemu
I for one am glad to see Europeans in the NHL and I hope the
NHL soon expands to Europe  Its nice to see all these different
people come together to form the soon to be  hockey teams

At the Lester Patrick Awards lunch Bill Torrey mentioned that one of his
options next season is to be president of the Miami team with Bob Clarke
working for him  At the same dinner Clarke said that his worst mistake
in Philadelphia was letting Mike Keenan go  in retrospect almost all
players came realize that Keenan knew what it took to win  Rumours are
now circulating that Keenan will be back with the Flyers

Nick Polano is sick of being a scapegoat for the schedule made for the
Red Wings After all Bryan Murray approved it

Gerry Meehan and John Muckler are worried over the Sabres' prospects
Assistant Don Lever says that the Sabres have to get their share now
because a Quebec dynasty is emerging 

The Mighty Ducks have declared that they will not throw money around
loosely to buy a team

Oilers coach Ted Green remarked that There some guys around who can
fill Tie Domi's skates but none who can fill his helmet

Senators' Andrew McBain told off a security guard at Chicago Stadium
who warned him of the stairs leading down to the locker room McBain
mouthed off at him after all being a seasoned professional  and

 I am originally from New York State and I go to school
 in North Carolina  Yet I don't constantly gripe about
 the lack of hockey  Wouldn't some of you who chose to go
 to school in the South realize most who gripe are Clemson students
 that hockey isn't quite as popular in South Carolina
 when you chose a school
 
 Why did you all excuse me  y'all choose schools in
 the South if hockey was this important to you  
 
 Not everyone has the luxury of deciding on a college by making sure the 
 hockey coveraage is what you want it to be  I am a Pittsburgh transplan
 to S C when at home and the coveraage sucks  Sports south didn't
even show
 the final game of the Stanley Cup laast year while it was happening  They
 put it on ktape delay and cut the intermissions then went off the air  
 When you move you take the good with the bad and deal with it  it doesn't
 mean thaat you can't complain about it
 
I was transplanted by my parents from the Greater Hartford area to the
Greater Cleveland Ohio area  This was not an action of my choice  The
only hockey coverage I could get there regularly was Red Wings and Penguins
explaining in part why I follow these teams today  In Cleveland you
couldn't even find hockey scores on the  o'clock news because they
figured that if they didn't have it it wasn't a sport
 


At least your parents didn't move you Idaho  The only things that get
any coverage there are football basketball and baseball

When talking about hockey broadcasters let's give a moment of silence to
remember the St Louis Blues' great Dan Kelly Many of you may have heard
him in the late s and early s on CBS He used to do Hockey Night In
Canada intermissions with another recently deceased great Danny Gallivan
of the Canadiens


I loved Dan Kelly  He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back
in  or so  No he wasn't always spot on top of the play and he
wasn't overly cute but those pipes  That lusty barrel chested voice
No pipsqueak was he unlike some fellas we know

I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the
Bus  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them  But I'll never
forget the night a year later when the Oilers closed it out at home in
the pandemonium the smoke from a million sparklers the long emptynet
goal near the end and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell the
story for a few long seconds then that voice barking through the din
Dave Lumley  sews it up for Edmonton  It sounds stupid but that
early for me hockey memory will always bring a thrill  Since then
I've grown a lot more jaded about the game but I was really saddened
by Dan Kelly's passing  He was one of the good guys

In the Smythe
This one is the toughest for me to call because I have to put
personal bias aside Go Calgary  I think a lot depends on who
wins the division  Winnipeg will move into third by the end of
the season and the first place winner will have a clear advantage
It will be a lot easier to build momentum against a team like the
Kings  Whoever plays the Kings in the first round will take the
division  Much as it hurts I have to pick
Division Winner  Vancouver Canucks

I'll have to disagree with you on this one I think Vancouver will go as
Bure goes and if he continues on his goal scoring slump then they
won't even make it out of the first round I think the Kings will make
it out of the first round regardless of who they play They seem to be
doing pretty well even with that bad game against Minnesota on
Saturday I think it'll be either Calgary or Los Angeles to win the
Smythe ie go on to the conference finals 

Wales Conference Trophy
Islanders and Bruins will fight to the end but I think the
Islanders have enough steam to overtake the Bruins in seven

Campbell Conference Trophy
a walk for Vancouver maybe in  or  but definately not 

Stanley Cup Final
Islanders and Vancouver  Islanders will have nothing left by
this point and will succumb fairly easily to the Canucks

Stanley Cup Champion Vancouver Canucks

Still have to disagree with you here I think it'll be Pittsburg to
get the hat trick in Stanley Cups They just look
toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good 

I hope you have enjoyed my predictions  I hope they are not
all correct Go Calgary

Neither do I Well may the best team win it all Pittsburg That's
just my  worth

Maine beat LSSU  in Milwaukee on Saturday night  It was quite a game
Maine stormed to a  lead in the first and looked like they might run away
with it  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game
LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 

LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards
The play went quickly with the refs running a noholdsbarred type of game
LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead  at the end of the second
Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game

Coach Walsh of Maine replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow who won
the game against Michigan  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie
The third period like the second belonged to the team behind  Maine scored
three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark
They were all scored by Jim Montgomery the tournament MVP and all assisted by
Paul Kariya

The last minute of the game bears highlighting  The change to Snow also
proved the difference in the end  With one minute to go and with the LSSU
goalie pulled Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by
both  Snow won  It was a great way to end the game

This year's three championships games were sold out last year in about one
month  The Bradley Center holds approximately

I'd LOVE to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some

crucial markets like Germany Italy and France while Sweden and Finland
probably can't afford to shell out  for tickets the way
AmericanCanadian fans do Call it the Minnesota North Stars effect
Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local inexpensive
hockey to the NHL The National Hockey League should love the idea though

 Fencesittinglook at Philly's record with Eric and without
 there is no doubt  Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise

Re Eric True but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be
like without Recchi for  games

Soderstrom Absolutely  shutouts in  games for a rookie without a lot
of defense in front of him Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring
a ton over their career best But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey puts scoring
ahead of defending and Fedyk has tailed off big time

Eklund Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries 
points in  games is not bad at all and recently he's been a huge factor
in the wins they've gotten Eklund has never had a point a game season in
his career his production is very typical for him How does he qualify as
a disappointment If anything he's a surprise

My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players
but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a  goalie My biggest
disappointment is Bill Dineen I thought that he was going to be the perfect
coach for this young team instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO
has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year Any
coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a
bright idea needs to go back to coaching school

The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum
Sunday night and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 
shutout Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke
a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from
mounting any serious attack

Injuries

Pelle Eklund is daytoday with a bruised thigh

Roster Moves

Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game Jason was the FLYERS
second pick in the first round th overall of the  entry draft  years
old '  lbs In  games with the tricity Americans he had  goals
 assists and  PIM He plays left wing and defense he played defense in
this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him
up front as well

Andre Faust was returned to Hershey He actually left after the second period
of the Kings game flew to Albany got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win
and played again for Hershey Sunday night

Game Summary

If the FLYERS played like this every night they'd be in the playoffs this
year The FLYERS hit everything that moved They created scoring chance after
scoring chance They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do

Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal
He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead
of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side
A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a
goal but Puppa made a great save reading the play

Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs th ranked power play the first chance when
he hooked Doug Gilmour at  The FLYERS lowly st ranked penalty killing
unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill The
Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept
away every rebound

After the power play the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play Rod Brind'Amour
gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the
net Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef
Beranek and Bob Rouse who were wrestling in the slot Beranek was able to
get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into
the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for
a  FLYERS lead at 

The FLYERS kept the pressure on and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS
from building on their lead for a while Eventually things settled down and
defense prevailed Each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies
were strong Bowen started giving some Lindroslike checks in his own corners
Then Lindros who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him thought he had
a chance to even the score He had Foligno lined up at center ice leaned into
him and rode him into the center ice boards The only problem was that Foligno
was a little far from the boards and Mike Mister McGeough felt that it
warranted a boarding call at 

The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were
very aggressive for a change on the kill

With time running out in the period Recchi carried through the neutral zone
and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line They were in
a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun Lindros tried a backhand pass
to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi but then Clark
checked Recchi off the puck Macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and
went right to McGill who had manned the point He drove it from just inside
the blue line Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own
goalie at  Shots were  FLYERS in the period

The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk
tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone During the power play the
FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric
gloved it down but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head We
could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove
and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end As time was
running out in the advantage Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal
mouth but Puppa made the save The rebound kicked back to the right corner where
Recchi picked it up passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle
and Eric onetimed past Puppa at  With the assist Recchi moves past
Bobby Clarke's  season the second best one season total for a FLYER at
  Eric moves up to th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with  points

Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at  to give the FLYERS another chance on
the power play Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with
a slash at  Not much happened on the  on  although the Leafs had most
of the possession The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play Tempers
flared a little at  Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors Keith Acton
got a bloody face Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a
hooking minor at  to set up a  on  The replay showed that Hawgood's
stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell
Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play led by Dimitri Yushkevich
Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson Berehowski
tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball He had the puck at the point
and just trickled a pass down the slot He made all the FLYERS look silly as
nobody could get a stick on it and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net
but Soderstrom stoned him

The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didn't
get anything home Shots were  FLYERS

The FLYERS were content with the  goal lead in the third period and they
decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a
little

The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first  or so minutes of the
period but couldn't get past Puppa Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making
road kill out of them and tempers flared  each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros 
unsportsmanlike conduct and  each for Glenn Anderson and McGill roughing
all at  Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at  on Gilmour

Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play

At about the  minute mark Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left
circle that got through Soderstrom The puck was rolling on it's side and
as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards
it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the
other Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at  to give the
Leafs another chance on the power play On the advantage after Soderstrom
stoned Andreychuk while lying down Andreychuk got the rebound through
Soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept
away by one of his defensemen They kept the pressure on but Soderstrom was
equal and preserved the shutout

Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl
at  No punches thrown Recchi got the initial minor Krushelnyski
Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors At  Rouse and Beranek
expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got  each for slashing to
set up another  on  Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS
zone as they were battling for the puck and while McGill was down he ran
his stick across McGill's face The FLYERS were not happy with that at all
 Al Conroy paired up with  Berehowski and started throwing punches
Upward Well Al held his own much to the delight of the crowd Each got
a couple punches in before going down in a head and Al got a standing O
Penalties Eastwood  cross check  game Clark Carkner  each Berehowski
and Conroy  each fighting at 

So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS The had no interest
in stting on the lead Hawgood Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until
Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and
blasted it past Puppa at 

That was all the fireworks Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot Puppa
did but kept the FLYERS off the board  FLYERS shots were  FLYERS in the
rd Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star
break Shutout number  for Soderstrom all since  Tied for nd most in
the NHL but he's played fewer games than Belfour  or the goalie I can't
remember that he's tied with

Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg The FLYERS cannot
be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night
in Washington would be the official end

FLYERS up to  points on the season in  games Last year they had  points
in  games  under  so they need at least  points in their last 
games to improve on that only by percentage points  under in  is better
than  under in 

Tragic number holds at  points with  games left The tragic number for th
is  points I watched the Rangers blow a  third period lead at home to
lose  before I finished this up Why  points instead of  Well the FLYERS
will win the tiebreaker if they catch them whereas the Islanders win tie
breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie The Rangers could crumble
down the stretch as they play the Devils the Pens twice the FLYERS and
finish up with  games against the Caps So I guess th place could be the
goal for the team to focus on

Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne
on the ice can be blamed on himRoger he is a FORWARD  Winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway  Let's put it another way  John Cullen's 
is terrible  What's your excuse for him  That his powerplay points don't
count  Neither do Selanne's 
 
 Are you comparing Cullen to Salami  I would say that that is valid  If
 Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami
 stand around the other team's blueline when the puck is in his own end

  I thought that he was comparing Cullen to TEEMU SELNNE I always thought
  that salami is some sort of sausage BUT IF YOU dear Roger ARE ABLE TO
  SEE SALAMI ON THE ICE PLAYING HOCKEY I don't know what to do but you
  surely should do something and very quickly

  Maybe you think that if you keep on talking some rubbish after some time
  everybody will consider it to be really true You should take care of
  your LEAFS they surely need it more
  
 
What he does best is scoreso I refer you to my comment above
 
 Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he
 can play a solid twoway game  I would have to say that this style
 of contribution would be more conducive to winning  Or don't you 
 think so

  At least we have seen him playing 
 
As it is now Selanne
is a grandstanding goal suck  Did you see the way he parades around
with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal  You would think the
Messiah had returned

 During the latest Philly game the Leaf players didn't parade Philly
 crunched them    Maybe you need some more two way players who can
 score too

TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that
Montreal will send  players   million including Vin Damphousse
and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia Phillie will send Eric Lindros
to Ottawa and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal

If this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa
gets to choose st overall  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary

Personally I can't see Philli giving up Lindros  for anything
They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away
again  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a huge draw in
Phillie  and that he represents a successful future for the
franchise

Ottawa may be better off taking the  players  from Montreal
for the pick

Stephen Legge
SLEGGEkeanucsmuncca

Two things

 Didn't the trade deadline pass two weeks ago

 The FLYERS would never ever EVER give up Lindros simple as that

 With Soderstrom and Roussel why the hell would the Flyers want to
   pick up an older and slumping Roy

BYW I could come up with a group of players they'd trade for but
they wouldn't be from the same team

 I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs biggest
 surprises and biggest disappointments this year Now these are just
 my observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an
 opportunity to see all the teams the same amount Anyway
   
 MVP  most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and
       in terms of leadership can't win without him
   
 Biggest surprise  the player who rose above expectation  the player
       that may have raised the level of his game to a new height even
       if that new level doesn't necessarily warrant an allstar berth
       includes those players who at the outset of the season may not
       even have been in the team's plans
    
 Biggest disappointment  the player from whom we expected more eg I
       picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on
       offence brought by Demers shouldn't Savard have done better

   Well here it is NHL in the year 
I got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and 
although I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong 
drugs now it seems the realization has really begun  You can see the 
league has already started to move to this direction

   The Walt Disney Conference
Anaheim Mighty Chipmunks    Franchise name to be changed after each new 
LA Kings                      hockey movie         
LA Flames                   We've seen some of that
San Jose Sharks
San Diego Bruins
Tijuana Red Wings   Detroit's hockey team will follow its car industry
Dallas Stars           
Houston Oilers
Texas Rangers
Seattle Canucks

   The Norm Green Conference
Alabama White Hawks
Biloxi Blues
Tampa Bay Lightning
Miami Blades
Helsinki Jets        You've heard them starting getting used to the anthem
Montreal Quebecois sp                 There will be no 'Canada'
Atlanta Devils
Orlando Penquins
Key West Islanders
Hartford Whalers                        The Whalers will never move huh
Palm Beach Capitals

  Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I'm really beginning to believe
the rest of the 'message'  I'm sure the future will turn you into believers 
too  After  the NHL will abandond icerinks  It's so expensive to cool 
down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is 
anyway  NHL will become a roller skating hockey league  That way it can 
create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the 
game in their back yards 

         I hope I'm just out of my mind
        There won't REALLY be a Disney team in Anaheim will there
        The Stars aren't REALLY moving

   I was reading a newspaper tidbit that mentioned that there is a
 grammatical error on the Stanley Cup This newspaper The 
 Union Leader  Manchester New Hampshire stated that one of the
 years that the New York Islanders won the cup the printing on the
 actual cup stated New York Ilanders Can anyone verify this I
 forgot the exact year that this supposedly occured Any diehard
 Islander fans know about this The reason why I am asking is
 because the paper is not very reliable we call it The Union

Speaking of spelling errors on the Cup I wonder if the h in
Pittsburgh made it to the Cup  You know how funny people can
be about spelling Pittsburgh

   Ten years ago the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now Going into the  season the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats

Canadians 
Americans 
Europeans 

   Please note that these numbers are rounded off and taken from the top
 players on each of the  teams My source is the Vancouver Sun

   Here's the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team let's say the
Red Wings and the Canucks and seeing names like Bure Konstantinov and
Borshevshky Is this North America or isn't it Toronto Detriot Quebec
and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well 

Is the answer as simple as that you dislike russians

    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the
Russian Rocket I will completely throw up As it is now every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will crosscheck Bure into the 
plexiglass so hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher By the way 
I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with  

Okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians and
some Americans It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans who aren't even
better hockey players It's all hype This European mystique is sickening
but until NHL owners get over it Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league

    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating the problem is clearly
only getting worse

And where would canadian hockey be today without the europeans Dont say
that the european influence on the league has been all bad for the game
I mean look at the way you play these days Less fights and more hockey
Imho canadian hockey has had a positive curve of development since the
's when the game was more brute than beauty

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent

Oh look You don't like Finns either

    I just don't want them on mine
Too bad almost all of you northamericans originates from europe

Hmmm And what kind of a name is Rauser Doesn't sound very canadian to
me 

PS When analyzing teams like Italy France and Great Britain you find that
a lot of their players are Canadians with double citizenship DS

From where I come from in Canada Borshevsky sounds more Canadian than
Smith 

Anyways crawl back into the hole you crawled out ofthe NBA doesn't
care where they get basketball players from major league baseball
doesn't give a damn where they get baseball players from except Cuba
that is

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary 
supplier of playersSweden Finland the Czech Republic and Slovakia
are all relatively small countries and cannot really produce players
at a greater rate than they are already producing them and the
potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted
because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and
will take a decade or two to recover and become a real threat and
the US will just maintain its slow increase  Canada should continue
to supply  plus of the top hockey players in the world for the
forseeable future

Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take
its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world
sportsand since soccer is essentially boring unlike hockey

    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the
Russian Rocket I will completely throw up As it is now every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will crosscheck Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher By the way I'm not a

    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating the problem is clearly
only getting worse


Canadians are under no threatthe European numbers will soon saturate
if they haven't alreadyand by the time Russia comes online again
the NHL should be a world league and there will be many more teams
to stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players  In the near
team the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of 
Americans not because of Europeans

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent

    I just don't want them on mine


Crawl into a hole and die

You know you're absolutely right  I think we should round up all those

see with whom should we start  I dunno Lemieux  Hmmmsounds like he

In yesterday's fracus between Rob Ray and Brent Hughes was it the camera angle or was
Ray actually punching Hughes where it appeared he was punching him For those that didn't
see the game  it was several inches below the belt and he punched him there quite a few
times Dreadful

Also why did Poulin get four minutes


I've been watching  playing hockey for a good long time now and
I've seen players with questionable tactics but never have I seen
what Ray did on Sunday This guy gets my all time loser award It's
one thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck
when they are down it's another thing to have a fist fight with
someones balls Ray should be thrown out of the league what an
ahole

As I've mentioned in the rules posting I will be out of town until the
day before the entry deadline so I won't be able to respond to your
messages until April 

I would be grateful if someone could repost the rules and instructions for
the playoff pool sometime next week for the benefit of those who missed the
first two postings

Thanks

    Here's the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL I am sick
 of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team let's say the
 Red Wings and the Canucks and seeing names like Bure Konstantinov and
 Borshevshky Is this North America or isn't it Toronto Detriot Quebec
 and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other
 teams is getting worse as well

    I'm sick too watching allamerican names like GRETZKY etc

    Which names you accept  Sitting bull and dances with wolves 

    It is North America What are you doing here

MIGHTY ONES GET MIGHTIER

TPS the Finnish Champions  are getting still stronger

I just heard some news according to which TPS has acquired
the next Finnish hockey superstar Jere Lehtinen from KiekkoEspoo

There are also some rumours about Erik Kakko Reipas and Marko Jantunen
KalPa being traded to TPS Both of this players are currently on the
Finnish olympic team I think that Jantunen is drafted to the NHL too

BTW Is Juha Ylnen centre HPK drafted by the Jets During last year
he has reached the top level among Finnish centres He had very good
playoff games against TPS

    I was playing this golf game and something interesting happened
On the th hole I drove the ball down the fairway when the ball was
in midflight the game completely froze A couple seconds later the
screen went completely black with an error message in large Bubble
letters that said DIVISION BY ZERO I thought it was funny considering
I am a computer programmer and I had never seen an error like this on
an actual video game system like Sega or Nintendo or even Atari or
Intellevision years ago Oh yeah after the message there was also
what must have been an address in hexadecimal I forget the exact hex
code that was given HAS THIS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE It must have
my game shouldn't have been the only one to do this

Thanks

On the Lindros trade  Like Ottawa would be stupid enough to get
Lindros  Why do you think Quebec traded him  Lindros would go on
personal strike againmaybe I should talk to Ottawa mgmt about
arranging such a trade  

On that xenophobe  Thankfully nobody agreed with him publicly  Maybe we
should look at baseball the supposed American pasttime sp  Look at
all the damn Latin Americans playing there  They should all be deported 
They aren't American  add sarcasm to taste

To Roger  Wow for once we agree  I hope this isn't a sign of things to
come I'll become a ranting lunatic who talks about nothing but the
Leafs being the best in the Campbell  

On the Rangers  I told someone that nothing that happened in the Patrick
would surprise me anymore  I lied  How the hell can a team go into
Washington earn a shutout then come back home and lose to pitiful
Hartford  The absolute pinnacle of mediocrity  I can't stand it
From what I've read the goalie is to blame this time as Beezer played
pretty poorly  Smith is talking about calling up Corey Hirsch from
Binghamton everybody is pointing fingers this is definitely not the
same team which wanted to prove itself in Washington  Now nothing that
happens in the Patrick will surprise me  Yeah right

  Foul Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your
    body or stick If you get  you are out for the game

I've never seen a game where one player has committed 
penalties  Something like this would require more attention by
the referee

 
  Unsportsmanlike contact An intentional foul This inlcludes all the
    current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding If you get two you
    are thrown out of the game and fined
 
  Technical foul Bad mouthing the ref by player or coach Penalty shot
    is awarded Two and you are thrown out of the game
 
 Besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets  penalties
 in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one
 until the end of the period The victim gets two shots if heshe was in
 the act of shooting when the foul ocured
 
 This works well for several reasons First penalty shots are the most
 exciting thing in hockey right So it follows that the more the better
 Next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can
 take a commercial Finally with only three penalties the network
 announcers Don Meredith Dick Vitale John Madden Pat Summerall and
 Marv Levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before
 the PA announcer says it
 

But you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not
have been one before  I can see the relationship between free
throws awarded after a certain number of fouls but it's
obviously easier to score in basketball there are more
opportunities  If a basketball team scores  points that's
at least fifty chances made  The average number of shots taken
by each team in a hockey game and this is a total guess is
probably around  and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe
 of them  You have some good ideas concerning the other
penalties but I think that a player should be awarded a
penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was
interfered with

Also later in the post you talked about how boring the NBA
game you attended was that play was stopped too often
Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a
hockey game

I think that NHLPA'  is the best video game available now
of course many things could be done better but i really appreciate that
the names of players are the real ones no matter if it lacks some logos
I am still playing it since November leading different teams to the finals
and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring
Yesterday I won the title using Toronto against Hartford  games to two
I played the playoffs in a  games fashion  minutes for each period and
the best scorer and shooter was Gilmour  shots if I remember well

Anyways crawl back into the hole you crawled out ofthe NBA doesn't
care where they get basketball players from major league baseball
doesn't give a damn where they get baseball players from except Cuba
that is

MLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba  They just have to
defect first  

Sort of like the situation used to be with RussianCzechetc hockey
players until the political situation in those countries changed


Major league baseball has told the Blue Jays and the Expos not to
sign Oscar Linares I think that is his name
Canada does not have the restrictions against
Cubans that the US has and other major league teams have told the
Canadian teams that they would be very unhappy if the Expos or the
Blue Jays would do this  Cubans players would not have to defect
to play in Canada and could play the  home games for the Expos
and Blue Jays without any trouble

Messier is a joke this year  bad back not withstanding  His play is
the reason the Rangers will be on the golf course in a couple of weeks
Gartner is my choice  the guy works his butt off every game

Kovalev  no surprise  He's played adequately but as bad defensively

Kovalev is too talented a player to play for Roger NielsonRoger needs
players who can't think for themselves and can only skate in straight
lines up and down the ice  Dudley and Nielson are the only two coaches
bad enough in the league to take talents like Mogilny and Kovalev and
not know how to turn them into Bure and Selanne

as was predicted in preseason  Perhaps he'll pull an Alex Mogilny in
a couple of years and surprise us then  Zubov wasn't expected to make
it out of the minors this season and owing to the number of injuries
has proved to be a very pleasant surprise


Get Muckler as coach and Kovalev will look like Mogilny

The trouble with the Rangers is that Neil Smith went out and got
players like Messier Kovalev and Graves who have been schooled in
taking the game to their opponent and attacking while hiring coaches
who are interested in ropeadope strategies  If you want the
Roger Nielsons of the world to be your coach you don't go out and
get a Mark Messier who is an old dog who can't learn new tricks
from a known loser and you don't waste your draft picks on players
like Kovalev

True rumor  Fact  A big three way deal

Montreal

Montreal gets Alexander Daigle the first round pick from Senators

Philly gets Damphousse Bellow Patrick Roy and a draft pick

Sheesh  The rumor mill strikes again  But let's just assume this were true
My question is this

What would Montreal give San Jose if the Sharks got first pick and took Daigle

These new rule changes are great  However I think that your rules are
MUCH too complicated  How will the normal average fan be able to count
how many fouls a player has  And then we would even have to remember the
names of the players in order to determine who drew the foul  And of
course there will have to be new subpositions like the power center
who just sits in the slot until the blue of course puck comes near him
and the shooting defenseman and the point defenseman  Finally we'll
be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penaltyshot takers 
Since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled we'll be able to
see Ulf Samuellson sp and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy

 I would have chosen Alex Zhitnik for biggest suprise  They
 did expect that he would become a great defenseman but I don't
 think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his 
 rookie year  His speed skating ability and puck control is
 exceptional  he is the one to watch on the Kings
 

I agree with Marty McSorely and Warren Rychel running a close second and 
third I am surprised more people have not noted Knickle as the biggest
surprise even though I personally do not really rate him well The biggest 
disappointment has to be Carson Though this is really unfair since too much 
was expected of him The second biggest disappointment is Melrose with his 
adolescent handling of the goaltending problems Putting Hrudey on the bench 
for a month is just stupid It did not contribute to the team coming out of 
its slump MVP is surely Robitaille

Ok but have you seen Tabaracci play yet  In his two starts and
his relief effort for Beaupre he has looked mighty sharp  don't
forget the shutout  I think he's let in just four goals over eight
periods of play  I like Hrivnak but we might actually have to give
some credit to David Poile for a change after this trade

Hopefully if Tabaracci starts against the Isles tonight I haven't
jinxed him

 I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs biggest
 surprises and biggest disappointments this year

 
                         Team           Biggest       Biggest
 Team                   MVP           Surprise     Disappointment
 
 Hartford Whalers        Sanderson      Cassells      Corriveau

My votes FWIW

Team MVP Pat Verbeek He fans on  of goal mouth feeds but he still has 
 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary sp team captain
throughout a tough couple of seasons Honorable mention Nick Kypreos and
Mark Janssens Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than
MVP but Kypreos  goals  PIM has been the hardest working player on
the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker I guess
I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value

Biggest surprise Geoff Sanderson He had  goals and  points last season
as a center then moved to left wing and has so far put up  goals and 
points He now has a new Whaler record  power play goals most all coming
from the right wing faceoff circle his garden spot Honorable mention Andrew
Cassels and Terry Yake The kiddie quartet of Sanderson Poulin Nylander and
Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention but Cassels is just 
and will score close to  points this season He has quite nicely assumed the
role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson Yake
bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still  and will put
up about  goals and  points this season Yake like Sanderson started
performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing 
although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the
right side

Biggest disappointment Hands down John Cullen Cullen had a disasterous 
point season last year his first full season after The Trade Cullen started
the season off of summer back surgery and fell flat on his face appropriate
since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass and whining about it
Cullen scored just  point on  games was a clubhouse malcontent commanded
the powerplay to a  success percentage  with Sanderson and sulked his
way out of town Worst of all his  year M contract had three years left
to run so no one would give up any more than the nd round draft pick the 
Maple Leafs offered to Hartford Honorable mention Steve Konroyd also subpar
after signing a  year M contract Eric Weinrich who showed flashes of
competence but overall has played poorly Jim McKenzie who was a much better
hockey player two seasons ago than he is now and Frank Pietrangelo who only
seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got
to make a number of starts in a row

For those Leaf fans who are concerned the following players are slated for
return on Thursday's WinnipegToronto game 
    Peter Zezel John Cullen

  Mark Osborne and Dave Ellett are questionable to return on Thursday

All regular players who were injured including Dimitri Mironov should be back

		With the kind of team Montreal has now  they can take the
cup easily  The only problem they have right now is that everyone is
trying to steal the show and play alone  They need some massive teamwork
 
This is known as the Savard syndrome  and we are talking Denis not Serge
No team will ever win squat with the likes of Denis Savard in their lineup
 
 
They could tell Savard to stay home and watch the games on TV

If life were so simple  Savard has not played in three of the last 
four games and they are still playing like crap  Montreal's problems
run deeper than Savard and Mouton unfortunately I hope they can
get their act together before the playoffs

The lineup in their game coming up against PittsburgH is said to be
the one they're likely to use for the playoffs  Let's hope they can
forget about the nice weather we're having and play hockey

   Here's the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team let's say the
Red Wings and the Canucks and seeing names like Bure Konstantinov and
Borshevshky Is this North America or isn't it Toronto Detriot Quebec
and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well 

Gee you'd think Winnipeg would be tops on that list what with  regulars
being European



    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the
Russian Rocket I will completely throw up As it is now every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will crosscheck Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher By the way I'm not a
Canucks fan to begin with  

Well being a Jet fan I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked silly
too  Nothing serious just enough to keep him out of a game 



    Okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians and
some Americans It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans who aren't even
better hockey players It's all hype This European mystique is sickening
but until NHL owners get over it Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league

In most cases the owners have very little to do with it  They give their
general managers one order when it comes to the draftfind me the best
players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup  Whether that player is
in Kindersley Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk Russia if the GM believes him
to be the better player the GM should be drafting him

Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league when referring to Canadian
players  It doesn't belong to them it belongs to the owners  The owners
can do what they want  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable
here in Canada there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US
that the CFL sorry for the football reference didn't even TRY to push their
import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers

Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions in most cases would
make players better anyways  Oh yeah and how many Europeans play at the
lower levels of professional hockey in North America  While there are some
that play in the AHL or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm
club you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL the ECHL or on
the secondary farm teams in the IHL  ie the Jets do have a few Russian
players in Moncton but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft Wayne
So with all those teams there are plenty of positions for hockey players
in North America


    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating the problem is clearly
only getting worse

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent

    I just don't want them on mine

I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the
world  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team and some of those
players were the among the best in the world  From Hedberg Nilsson and
Sjoberg to Selnne Zhamnov and Olausson and all those in between and to
come I wouldn't have it any other way

BTW Is Juha Ylnen centre HPK drafted by the Jets During last year
he has reached the top level among Finnish centres He had very good
playoff games against TPS

Yes Ylnen is a draft choice of the Jets  Assuming of course this
is the same Ylnen that played for KiekkoEspoo in   He was a
th round st overall pick of the Jets in the  entry draft

I noticed in the summaries that Ylnen had really begun to play well in

I'd LOVE to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some
time There's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several
crucial markets like Germany Italy and France while Sweden and Finland
probably can't afford to shell out  for tickets the way
AmericanCanadian fans do Call it the Minnesota North Stars effect
Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local inexpensive
hockey to the NHL The National Hockey League should love the idea though
PanEuropean TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the
American networks likely never will pay

This brings up a question I asked myself no answer when it was mentionned
that the NHL could expand in Europe

Would most of the Northamericans now playing in the NHL be willing
to play for a team in Europe

I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily
interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level
I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player

When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes
me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved  Remember these

 Lindros did not want to play in Quebec for more than  reasons
 Nicholls  in Edmonton
 R Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only
 C Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year

I know there are many noncultural reasons behind these but there is more

 Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french
  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities  One
  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could
  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal

Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved
to London Spain etc  for the one year of that new football league
 years ago

I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe

Myself I would like to see some European teams but what would be 
the best way to do it

 Of course penalties will have to be changed
 
 Roughing	Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive
 Slashing	Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration
 Fighting	Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings
 

NO NO NO since all the penalties fall into three classes there should
only be three penalties

 Foul Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your
   body or stick If you get  you are out for the game

 Unsportsmanlike contact An intentional foul This inlcludes all the
   current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding If you get two you
   are thrown out of the game and fined

 Technical foul Bad mouthing the ref by player or coach Penalty shot
   is awarded Two and you are thrown out of the game

Besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets  penalties
in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one
until the end of the period The victim gets two shots if heshe was in
the act of shooting when the foul ocured

This works well for several reasons First penalty shots are the most
exciting thing in hockey right So it follows that the more the better
Next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can
take a commercial Finally with only three penalties the network
announcers Don Meredith Dick Vitale John Madden Pat Summerall and
Marv Levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before
the PA announcer says it

Oh one other rule When a goal is scored  times a period the play
cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it This way the network
can sneak in a few more commercials Then once the PA announcer has told
them who scored the TV announcer can tell you the viewer and even have a 
chance of pronouncing his name right

Seriously though I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week
for the first time in my life I was amazed how boring it was The play is
so slow they actually had fans come out for things like freethrow shooting
contests DURING THE PERIOD Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their 
routines at least  times during the game and not just between periods
either There is a whistle every  seconds on average maybe less The
game is  minutes with  minutes between quarters  and  and a
 minute halftime and it still takes over  hours

The reason for this has to be TV There is plenty of room to throw in
commercials and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening
On TV basketball is fairly entertaining IMHO But it is better to watch
it on TV than to be there If this is the road the NHL is following then
it truly is a sad day

Enough for now

 Draft news

        Under terms of the new expansion draft which will be held in 
June each of the  existing clubs will be allowed to protect one 
goaltender five defensemen and nine forwards The most recent expansion 
drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction 
between forwards and defensemen
        Firstyear pros only will be exempt from the draft which is down 
from the twoyear exemption teams had last season San Jose Tampa Bay and 
Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt secondyear pros
        Each of the  teams will lose two players with a maximum loss of 
one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman The one exception is 
that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman
        At the end of the first phase of the draft the two new franchises 
will have three goaltenders eight defensemen and  forwards for a total 
of  players A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose Tampa 
Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two 
new teams
        Ottawa Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority 
drafting selection in the  draft as long as they have the three worst 
records Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth The 
expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose 
Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions
        The two new teams will pick first and second in the  Entry 
Draft regardless of their finish in  Should either of the two new 
teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in

After watching the Pengiuns all year and as many other teams as
possible I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots
this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other
goaltenders I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it Just
as examples last night I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the
head which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens
Scott and Tocchet  minute minors He also KICKED John McLean Of
course he wasn't called for that Isn't kicking an automatic match
penalty and  game suspension I think Glenn Anderson got one a few
years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest There's no doubt in
my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall He's also
very good

How about that Tocchet headbutt Is there an automatic susppension that
goes along with a nonkicking match penalty I can't remember anymore

Oh the playoffs should be fun

Now if we could just clone Chelios's personality and transplant it
into all of the defensemen on the Islanders Capitals and Devils
 
Gerald
 
In other words you want to turn them all into assholes so they
will spend lots of time in the penalty box and get lots of
misconducts
 
And this comes from a Chelios fan

Yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 
minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the
best defenseman in the league I'd take a whole team of Chelioses if I
could That way when one got a penalty the others could kill it

mattbhawksamsungcom Matt Brown writes
more about the MessierSamuelsson incident
While this is true strictly speaking it was the Rocksteady replicant who
initially used his stick illegally to measure Messier's ribcage There is no
question in my mind from seeing the replay in slomo that Ulf was
coming at Messier with intenttohasta la vista in mind and should have
been gone for that 

 I agree with Rick that Ulf's cross check wasn't illegal It was the kind
 of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called Slomos
 sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are
 Besides if Messier can't take the heat he should stay out of the kitchen

So Staffan how is Mattias Timmander doing this year And any impression
on Markus Czeriew lost my roster list on Hammerby Does it look like
they will make it to the Eliteserien for next year And then get stomped
if Markus goes to Boston

 Well Matt Mattias Timmander hasn't been playing with the MoDo elite league
 team yet just the MoDo junior team so I predict he needs a few more years
 here before he can join the B's I saw him play in the Swedish championship
 game for junior players this year and he played very well a physical game
 but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does I suspect you would like to
 have a Ulf typeofplayer on the B's team too 
 As for Mariusz Czerkawski he has had a great season for Hammarby in
 division  He scored if I remember correctly  points this season
 and then we have to keep in mind that a  point season in Sweden is
 considered very good due to the limited number of games Mariusz is
 Djurgarden property he was just on loan to Hammarby so he will play
 in Elitserien next season unless the B's can get him of course
 I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to
 watch in Swedish hockey this season

MessageID Aprvaxa

	Well the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night 
The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens  That means if the Isles
beat the Devils on Friday the will meet the Caps in the playoffs

	However I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in
general that I need to get off my chest   First of all with the Islanders 
backtoback lackluster performances against the Whalers one may think that 
the Islanders are out of shape  These guys always suck wind in the nd period
come on a little in the rd and run out of gas too soon  It is unbelieveable
how many one goal games these guys have lost  Anyway the games was pretty 
wide open  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring  The Whalers played 
a golie in is st NHL start I think his name was Lenarduzzi sp  His NHL 
debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles  Like I mentioned before this 
guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while until he misplayed a 
Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot 
correctly  Has anyone else noticed this

	Also I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick
Vukota gets as much ice time as he does  This guy has about as much hockey
talent as Jiggs MacDonald who did play hockey I think  Anytime he gets the
puck it gets stolen and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties 
Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap  And he's a
defenseman  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plusminus 
This guy gets beaten all the time  Why the need for such enforcers  Not
only do fights slow the game down ALOT but it takes away from the guys who are
really trying to play the game  I'll be one of the few to admit I do enjoy a 
good fight once in a while but only when it's called for  You know when a
guy checks the goalie too hard  In other words a violation of hockey ethics
might cause you to get puched  But there is no need to start crap when you are
losing or becuase you can get away with it Does anyone agree that referees
need to be a little less lenient in the rd and OT  I mean COME ON already 
I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down holding guys etc just becuase the
referee doesn't call it  OT and late in the rd should be a time for strategy
not physical prowess  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost 
If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to
pull a guy down to prevent it you don't deserve to win in the first place

If there's anyone who can help me on these items please
let me know

  Markus Naslund  I saw that MoDo lost early in the National
                     tournament and that he was playing for the national
                     team at the World Championships  Any stats
                     available  Any word on how he's playing  When
                     is he expected to join the club  


 Markus had a good season in MoDo in the Swedish elite league scoring
  goals  assists  points and  PIM in  games

 As Daryl points out Markus won't be joining the Pens for this year's
 playoffs since the World Championships starts April th

 But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next
 season MoDo though naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg
 and Naslund so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for
 personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind
 of money they would receive in NHL

Daryl Turner writes
By 'the club' I would assume you mean the Pens  Don't hold your breath
you aren't going to see Naslund this year  The World Championship
Tournament doesn't start until  April  So NHL teams won't see any
influx of Europeans and no team playing in the WC will see a sudden
influx of 'eliminated' NHLers  The earliest a player on a playoff bound
team could join a WCteam is the last game of the round robin and I
doubt any coach is going to want to play short one player for that long

 Actually Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two
 spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers It is Mats Sundin and
 Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team although in a late
 stage of the tournament Technically I seem to recall that you can leave
 spots open until  hrs before the WC final

I didn't say every team MUST have a number of local players Rather the
European teams should get the CHANCE to sign their top players before the rest
of the league comes in I agree that birthplace isn't that important
Dusseldorfer EG of the German league average close to  fans and they
don't have a single Germanborn forward Lion Milan made the European Final
Four with fifteen Canadianborn players But nationality is going to be an
issue in Sweden and Finland I think We really need an issue preventing
Lindros and Mario from ending up being drafted by a European team and vice
versa Player trades are a different matter  any player can end up anywhere
after being drafted

DEG has many germanborn forwards in the team In fact the majority of players
are germanborn  DEG had  average in  spectator arena

might have been the ninth and final regular season encounter between Helsinki

 will still have the Jennings Trophy at the end of the year  Potvin is very
 good and I do believe that he will be a star but I want to see him
 perform in the playoffs under pressure

You don't think he is performing under pressure now  The major
differences  between playoff hockey and normal hockey is  play
ing every other night which is physically exhausting and    You
play  the  same  team  in a consecutive string of games  Is this
what you mean by pressure  Have you even thought about what  you
mean  by pressure or are your thoughts like most of the rest of
this drivel simply halfbaked

This was Marramseycslaurentianca for anybody who
would like to check

He went on in another article to say paraphrased

Playoff hockey is just an expression used by announcers to convince
simpleminded folks like yourself that what you are seeing is a better
product than a regularseason game

NOW however in article Aprramseycslaurentianca 
Roger Maynard writes

With a  win over a tough Whaler squad the Leafs showed all doubters
what playoff hockey is all about  
 

So Roger what exactly is playoff hockey all about  Or is it a convenient
phrase to use in certain circumstances only

You see when you spout off with flame bait too many times sooner or later
it catches up with you

Anyway this game continued a trend that has sadly been taking shape for
a couple of weeks now  I had hoped it was fatigue or an aberration but
I can't snow myself any longer  Alex Mogilny must be benched as a
disciplinary action and soon

His explanation for Ysebaert jumping between him and LaFontaine to score the
winning goal yesterday  Wasn't my guy ask Patty about it

Actually this stuff from Mogilny doesn't surprise me all that much  About 
or  weeks ago I read in the Toronto Sun a quote from Alex it went something
like sarcastically

Yep Patty's the man  He's responsible for the team's successI'm a 
nobody around here

I was going to post it at the timeI must have forgot since nobody else 
was talking about him being a problem

If I heard that in the locker room I'd beat the shit out of him on the spot
Patty took responsibility in the press taking the heat off of Alex  That's
because LaFontaine is the epitome of class and a consummate team player

Yep I'd beat the shit out of him too  LaFontaine really must be a team
playermakes you wonder what the Islander management was thinking
My question is what the hell is Muckler doing  Whether he wishes to admit it
or not the team is his to coach and if he can't do the job then maybe the
job should be given to somebody who can  

Gee kinda like Alex's spot on the team isn't it

Im sorry to tell you this but unless they pull off another  miracle there
 is no way the HABS will win this year   Ever since they traded for
Ramage and since Savard came off injury they have been playing shinny  And
you cant blame Roy for the  loss to Washington when  players could not
score one goal  I know you think
I am a Boston fan but all of my years have been dedicated to Les HABS

David Degan

Well it seems that the Habs have been much talkedabout of late so here's my
  These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the
damn net  Watch them in the offensive zone especially on the powerplay 
Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone maybe pass to the
point get it back skate some more pass it aroundBUT WHERE'S THE SHOT
Answer the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands
in front of the net a la Neely Shanahan Tocchet etc etc  Too bad 
Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often  Dammit
even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions  Montreal desperately needs
a power forward with some talent IMO

Then watch them in their own zone Patrick Roy is screened on everything Say
what you want about his performance IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see 
And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net 
Last night against Washington Roy played a great game  The first goal came
on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time and he
didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot  The second goal came on a
deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway  Pathetic defence  The
third goal was EN

No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen

Wales Conference Adams Division Semifinal
Boston vs Buffalo
The Bruins are playing some excellent hockey and with Cam Neely back
and Moog his old self again this should be a cakewalk  BRUINS IN 

I'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle but I agree that Boston will likely win the
series  Goaltending is about equal top offensive players are about equal
MogilnyLaFontaine vs OatesJuneau but Buffalo has no answer to Neely
not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw in fact he's one
of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin    And the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway  But I think it will go six

Quebec vs Montreal
This one is very tough to call Montreal certainly has the experience
factor but Quebec is more talented IMHO It'll come down to the
goalies  I'll go with experience and Roy CANADIENS IN 

Agreed herebut Montreal will be pushed to the limit  Is it just me or
does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy  Go Habs

Final
Boston vs Montreal
Will Bruin domination continue in this rivalry Yes Moog has
consistently outperformed Roy in the playoffs after other stuff
 Bruins in five

I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for
 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players especially to play
in the Garden  Last time they beat the B's  but Boston had a clear
territorial advantage the victory was Roy's  At the same time I can't
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so I'll just say I will
not be putting money on this series 

Patrick Division semifinal

Pittsburgh vs NY Islanders
What can I say The Pens are flying high and have the most talent in
the league 

Agreed  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent
of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year  Pens in five which is
credit to NY

Washington vs New Jersey
CAPITALS IN 

Agreed here too but I think it will go at least six  Jersey has a decent
team and Washington has done poorly against the division this year

Pittsburgh vs Washington
If the Caps had Bill Ranford I might see an upset but Don Beaupre
just doesn't inspire my hopes  PENGUINS IN 

I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled  I don't
think it will go six eithermaybe five

CONFERENCE FINAL
Pittsburgh vs Boston
A replay of last year The Penguins are just as good as  months ago
and the Bruins are much improved But PENGUINS IN 

If Pittsburgh plays Boston IMO they win in likely five possibly six  They
own the Bruins  If they play Montreal I think it will go to seven and once
again I won't be putting money on the seventh game  I say seven because the
Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season

Campbell Conference Norris Division semifinal

Chicago vs St Louis or Minnesota
 BLACKHAWKS IN 

Chicago will win but I think in at least six  Chicago is not that good
IMO  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties

Detroit vs Toronto
The Leafs have had an excellent season but they've been playing
playoff hockey all year  the Habs under Burns were the same way and
always wilted in the playoffs  RED WINGS IN 

Very true  The Leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out
why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs  Toronto might win two or three 
at MLG though  Wings in six maybe even seven

FINAL
Chicago vs Detroit
 This will be a war Fedorov will win it in OT RED WINGS IN 

It will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them all 
And yes I think Detroit will win  Probert will have to come up big though

Smythe Division SEMIFINALS

Vancouver vs Winnipeg
 CANUCKS IN 

Our first disagreement  Canucks are playing like shit  They don't use their
size at all which may explain why they get hammered  by a team
chasing them CalgaryWinnipeg in six

Calgary vs Los Angeles
This would have been tough to call except for three things  The
Kings don't have a goalie  Gary Roberts will be back  the Kings
shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner Paul Coffey
for a proven loser Jimmy Carson Gretzky is just too weary to carry
this group FLAMES IN 

This is also tough for me to call because I haven't seen the Smythe enough 
I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in Coffey is a
nonissue who cares what Carson has done before and never underestimate
Gretzky  LA in six

FINAL
Vancouver vs Calgary
 FLAMES IN 

If it is these two Calgary will not need six games  But I think it will be
LAWinnipeg anyway and LA in seven because of home ice

COFERENCE FINAL
Detroit vs Calgary
 RED WINGS IN 

Wow must've been tough to go against your team  But let's see I picked
LADetroit  Detroit will win probably in six

STANLEY CUP FINAL
Pittsburgh vs Detroit
Three in a row and official 'dynasty' status for the Pens Or can the
Wings complete a dream season Well the Wings are better in goal not
sufficiently so though IMHO and have better Dmen However Mario and
the boys can sure score Look for Jagr to shine in the playoffs
though I sure would love to see Probert beat some sense into him The
Pens are just too much especially since Detroit will have a tougher
battle to get here PENGUINS IN 

If Pittsburgh plays Detroit it will go longer than five and I wouldn't bet
against the Wings  They are very strong IMO and nobody knows how strong
because they've been underachieving most of the year  If forced to choose
though I'd have to take the Penguins

A side note  Vlad last week you said that Selanne was a better player than
Gilmour  NO WAY  He is a more talented pure goal scorerbut aside from
the age difference there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team
I'm not asking for flames either btwI've spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player  But while
he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively give Teemu an edge
Gilmour does it all  I know a lot of Gilmourbashing goes on esp
from Flame fans  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill  He is easily one of the best
allround players in the NHL

   What's so bad about the new playoff format Do you really believe teams
that finish fourth in their div deserve to be in the playoffs 
With the new format you have more of a chance to see more teams Do you
really want to see the Bruins against the Sabres umpteen times or would
you rather see the Bruins and the Capitals in the secound round of playoffs

There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just
a little over a decade ago and noone showed up for the early rounds in
the playoffswhereas soon after they went to the divisional setup
arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds  

The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will
show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the
Bruins play the Captials in the first round

Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will
no longer be the case  The experiment is worthwhile with the uneven
distribution of the expansion teams but I prefer the divisional 
playoff

He was already offered  million for them from Northlands Coliseum
but refused the offer I don't think he is going to sale I think he
may decide to move the team to the States though where he can draw
more revenue from the team


Pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political
office in Northlands and in the business community that the Oilers
with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly
basis they will likely have an operating loss based on normal hockey
revenues and expenses  That he did this was a good thingit is better
he complain early and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis
before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollarswhich would
truly jeopardize the franchise

Pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move but to sell
a minority share of the team to realize some of the appreciated value
of the team and to get a better arena deal either in Northlands or
via a new building  Pocklington probably isn't going to get exactly
what he wantsbut ultimately he will probably get enough or will
sell to someone who will probably get enough

There are a lot of risks in moving a team also

one has to remember Peter Puck's principleit is better to
spend other people's money than one's own if at all possible

You'll have a hard time selling any sport to a community that

Hockey is pretty much a sport for the white and well off

What White yes Well off definitely not Hockey season ticket owners have
the lowest average income of any of the four major North American sports

And think of where the majority of hockey players come from From a farm out
in Boondock Saskatchewan or Weedville Alberta

When was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city
The insurance alone is a big enough barrier

The inner city isn't the only place that is poor
I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is no ICE to play on

   You might want to clarify the  game winning streak  That Pens streak
is a PLAYOFF streak tied by the Chicago Blackhawks who had won  in a row
until they met the Pens in the finals last year  The  game unbeaten so far
is a regular season unbeaten streak  But hey don't take it personally  I'm a
Flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch  But with a healthy Lindros Recchi
Brind'amour and Tommy Soderstrom they'll be there next year
By the way since the Flyers need defenseman what kind of trade would
anybody suggest from the existing Flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that

Terry Carkner won't be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook
paper would be better defense

Really  What makes you think the Islanders have a better shot  They
couldn't even beat the Whalers in two games

Well since you're a Pens fans the whole question is moot  I think
the teams most likely to beat the Pens are the Bruins Nordiques and
Blackhawks but I don't think they can really do it

The bottom line is the Bruins are the better team this year
Montreal fans have been screaming for years that their beloved Canadiens deserve
another cup Since the removal of the French Canadien rule they have been screaming
foul Welcome to league parity something the rest of the league has had for years
Even if the Habs do beat Boston in the playoffs they won't get by the Pens
I do agree with you Boston is the more taleneted team


The French Canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the
universal draft was instituted in the sixties and only lasted for a
few yearsand really didn't have any substantial effect during that
period  The Canadiens Stanley Cup achievements were earned on a
level playing field

After watching the Pengiuns all year and as many other teams as
possible I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots
this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other
goaltenders

Have a look at Ed Belfour

He also KICKED John McLean Of
course he wasn't called for that 

Belfour kicked Gerrard Gallant when the Wings played the 'Hawks
a couple of weeks ago No penalty No review No suspension
This was after he attacked Bob Probert in the previous period
He was penalized for that

There's no doubt in
my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall
He's also very good

Likewise Belfour Too bad he goes down so much

This is wrong Among Lemieux's  points we do NOT know how many

scored but not how many PP assist he accumulated We also don't know
the  times he was on the ice but not credited on the goals the Pens

That is what my point really was There is not straight dependency between

Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little
easier for the playoffs Let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of
each other while Chicago sweeps stlouis That just makes it easier in
the second round with all the rest they will get and tordet getting
none For the conf champ they will have a hard time versus the division
but that div will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the
Hawks again Then bring pitt and sure the Hawks will probably lose but
its better to get that far and lose than to not go

  What makes you think so  I'd like to understand your reasoning
  From my seat the Caps don't really appear to believe that they can 
  defeat Pittsburgh  Therefore they don't  I think their spirit was 
  broken in last year's playoffs and hasn't really recovered  I don't know 
  what the season series numbers were but I believe that the Pens won it
  I think that either the Devils or the Islanders will cause more problems for
 
 
 What is this spirit crap  I'm a Caps fan and hope they win
 if they end up facing Pittsburgh
 but I don't think the Caps lose to Pitt because of lack
 of spirit  Yes the Penguins won the season series against the
 Caps  They've won eighteen games in a row for God's sake
 Did you ever think the Penguins might be good and that's
 why they win

I reread what I wrote and it didn't say exactly what I thought  

Sure the Pens are a better team  They've got size and the best skill players
in the league  They've also got the best clutch goaltending  They're the 
best team in the league

But my point was the Caps have not played to their ability level vs the
Pens since last year's choke  And that's the mental problem the one they've
had for a number of years I tried to point out  Spirit mental preparedness
will to win whatever you want to call it it's missing when the Caps play the
Pens  Actually you're right  it won't make any difference

How can you assume it was a sarcastic remark

For someone whose first language is not English I would interpret
that comment to mean that he believes Pat is the MVP on the team and that
he is just one of the other normal players  Quite modest I might say

On March   Roger Maynard wrote in reply to an article by Graham
Hudson

You don't think he is performing under pressure now  The major
differences  between playoff hockey and normal hockey is  play
ing every other night which is physically exhausting and    You
play  the  same  team  in a consecutive string of games  Is this
what you mean by pressure  Have you even thought about what  you
mean  by pressure or are your thoughts like most of the rest of
this drivel simply halfbaked

This was Marramseycslaurentianca for anybody who
would like to check

He went on in another article to say paraphrased

Playoff hockey is just an expression used by announcers to convince
simpleminded folks like yourself that what you are seeing is a better
product than a regularseason game

NOW however in article Aprramseycslaurentianca 
Roger Maynard writes

With a  win over a tough Whaler squad the Leafs showed all doubters
what playoff hockey is all about  
 

So Roger what exactly is playoff hockey all about  Or is it a convenient
phrase to use in certain circumstances only

You see when you spout off with flame bait too many times sooner or later
it catches up with you

Nice try Deepak but tough Whaler squad should have clued you in to the
fact that my Leaf woofing was tongueincheek

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then
it is because the teams are facing each other at least  consecutive times
in  days and hockey being the contact sport that it is some things will
be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season  But that is
only for some of the players  Many of the rest who have been playing with
injuries who miss their families or who like Grant Fuhr would really
rather be playing golf don't really give a damn  Of course I can't say this
for sure but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I
don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically
human attitudes  

With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing 
money by participating in the playoffs  The ones who regard the playoff
take as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely
to consistently be a force in the playoffs  Now I know some of you are
going to come back with winning spirit and all of that crap but these
players are professionals after all  While they may love to play the 
game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose which is to make
a decent living 

Of course the coach is a professional as well and part of what he is 
being paid to do is motivate the players  So if the coach does his
job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort

The second season is after all merely an exhibition  The true Champions
of the league are the division winners the teams that come out on top 
after the long struggle of the season  The Stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and hot  The 
emphasis on the playoffs with their sudden death appeal has been promoted
by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind  Even if Pittsburgh
loses the playoffs we all know that they were really the best team in the
league over the year  They proved it

cordially as always

   The Pens won't be playing Montreal because Boston will win Adams
   divisional play  Buffalo and Quebec will make decent showings
   Boston out of sheer determination will win a game against the Pens
   but no more  They have heart but the Pens have too many big guns and
   too many ways to win
 
    If Boston does indeed win the Adams nothing is certain and
 indeed gets to play the Pens then I think you'll find a very
 different Boston team this year Boston will use every trick in the
 book to shut down the Pens offense  something they didn't even try
 last year The Pens' weak spot is defense and goaltending  if Boston

First I enjoyed reading your post  Second I disagree with the Pen's weak
spot being defense and goaltending  for a couple of reasons  Barrasso has
had a spectacular year  no slow start consistently sharp GAA   and 
leads the league in wins  Tommy deserves the Vezina  Given the lack of 
respect he commands though I doubt he will win it  The other reason 
concerns the Pens' team defense  They are hovering around rd or th in the
fewest goals allowed  That is a big improvement for them and it indicates
that they are playing better team defense

 can shut down the Pens' offense and get an early goal then you have a
 real game If the Pens score first then it's practically over I
 don't think the Pens have the discipline to stick to the team game if
 they're held scoreless  minutes into the second
 
    Boston doesn't have the guns of the Pens but the Pens doesn't have
 the defense goaltending and discipline of Boston Still Boston can
 put the puck in the net Remember that Boston is not a runandgun
 Patrickstyle team although they played runandgun hockey for the
 better part of the regular season who doesn't Even Neely backchecks
 all the way in behind his own net if necessary
 
    Penaltykilling will be a big factor Boston are I believe  over
 the last something shorthanded situations meaning they have
 scored  SHG while giving up  PPG one in a lackluster game against
 Ottawa
 
    I'd say the series will go to  or  But I'm much less certain
 whether it will be in favor of the Pens or the B's Their styles going
 into the playoffs are too different to make it predictable Still I'd
 place my bets on the Pens I think My prediction is that if the B's
 can get the first goal in four of the games they'll take the series
 Otherwise the Pens will
 
    But I'd rather wait and see whether the B's will actually get out
 of the Adams to begin with Buffalo Quebec and Montreal aren't
 exactly planning to call it a game and go home

st round 


PITT vs NYI  PITT in  

It looks like a safe bet  NYI has been bagging it of late
NYI and NJD have a showdown Friday night for the honour
of Pittsburg anyway  Pigsburg in 

WASH vs NJD  WASH in  
I think that NJD have a solid team and will compete with
WASH  I agree though with WASH in 

BOS  vs BUF  BOS  in  
The B's have been playing awesome hockey in the last
two weeks  The only question is how long will it last
Fuhr is a dud  BOS in 

QUE  vs MON  MON  in 
It seems to me that MON is much like the VAN  no chemistry
The Habs seem to be not in stride QUE in   

CHI  vs STL  CHI in  
STL should not be in the playoffs CHI in 

DET  vs TOR  DET in 
I am a diehard Leaf fan but  It seems that the Leafs
offense is shutting down in the last week  Can they
turn it around against Detroit  As I recall the last
couple of time these two teams met the Leafs were pummelled
I don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet  If he is
DET in   If not DET in 

VAN  vs WIN  WIN in 

Upset in the making here  Another team with bad chemistry
There is something gone foul among Linden Momesso and Bure
WIN in 

CAL  vs  LA  CAL in 
Anybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL does
not watch the Smythe a whole lot  LA is a bunch of Geritols
CAL in 


nd round 


PITT vs WASH PITT in  
It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team  Their
saving grace though is Bowman  He can put anybody in their place
However if PIGS have a quick first round they may be a little
too high  WASH could be there for a surprise  Having said that
I will say PITT in 

BOS  vs MON  BOS  in 
MON will not be there  BOS is surprising me of late Cam is great
The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the
B's  B's in 


CHI  vs DET  CHI  in 
Yikes  This will not be pretty  But DET is running like a machine
of late  They've had a nonbusy end of the season in which they played
like killers  DET in 

WIN  vs CAL  CAL  in 
CAL has a solid team a little weak in the nets  CAL will out
muscle WIN  CAL in 

rd round 


PITT vs BOS  PITT in  

I hate PITT  My logic eludes me  The dark side will take over
and give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT  There may
be something to this  if you think of the rivalry  BOS in 
CHI  vs CAL  CHI  in  

Finals


PITT vs CHI PITT in  

NO no no  We have BOS vs DET  I don't know what to say
here  Both teams will be flying and overdue  I will go
with goaltending and muscle and say DET in

 You have completely missed the point with the Selke trophy  It goes
to the best defensive forward  This is the forward who forgoes points
to help his team out defensively  It is an unsung hero of sorts  Yes
Lemieux and Gilmour are good defensive players but they play a more
offensively oriented style than a true defensive forward  This year

You mean guys that check but can't score  The guys who can both check
and score shouldn't be candidates  Is that right

The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals
from being scored not to score them  When Lemieux or Gilmour play their
number one purpose is to score defence is secondary especially considering
the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one  That is
why they are not Selke candidates

 When Tarasov called Bob Gainey the best player in the world it was
assumed that he meaned the best technical player the one who knew
every intricacy about playing hockey and never made a technical error

And who was it that made this assumption  All of your friends maybe
Sorry Greg but  people aren't enoughyou can assume all that you
want to but if you think Tarasov was serious then you are an idiot

Someone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation
it was a few months ago  Whoever this was please repost it

I agree with this assessment  Bob Gainey may have been the best technical
player ever

Right Greg  Did you see this in the Sun or something  What did you think
of Claude Provost  Gainey was nothing more than a journeyman player who's
outstanding abilities were entirely political  He might have had a col
lection of defensive skills but he had absolutely no offensive skills at
all  None  But perhaps you think that the abilities to pass the puck shoot
the puck and deke a goalie or defenseman are not technical skills  

Gainey is the best defensive forward ever  I stand by that assessment
He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame  Did you
ever watch him play He never made a technical error

Babbling deleted

Gee Greg the pundits were calling Gilmour the best twoway player in the
league way back when he was with St Louis  I would have expected you to
have picked up on that 

Who are these pundits  Gilmour was good with St Louis but he was not the
best twoway player in the game when he was with them  You have overhyped
Gilmour on this net for months  He is a very good forward but hardly the
best in the NHL

  is a good stat because it is the only stat that I am aware of that
 takes into account defensive play  It isn't a measure of defensive
 play it takes into account offense and defence all aspects of play
                                                   
  If we are interested of real allround players the power play stats
  should be considered too Because the power play is also one aspect 
  of play There is still something to be done with these player evaluation
  tools

IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man
advantage  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
because their point totals are inflated by power play points
 tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull
John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck

Given the opportunity to play power play consistently any player can
inflate his totals

 To adjust 
 
  First calculate a teams   Goals Scored  PP Goals Scored 
 Goals allowed  PP Goals Allowed when they were penalty killing
 
   Divide this number by  to take into account of the fact that there
 are  players on the ice and each is  responsible for the team 
 
   A players adjusted  is His raw   Team Adjustment
 
 BTW  If anyone could calculate and post adjusted  ratings it would be
 greatly appreciated  I might find the time to do so but don't count on
 it

I have a database filter set up for the player stats  When it is posted for
the end of season I'll repost the team averages  You don't need to go through
the complicated team adjustment you are using  all you need is the team
average by summing all the individual players'  and divide by the total
number of players on the team  This will be a little distorted because the
players who have been traded recently will have come with  scores based
on their original teams  This shouldn't distort it too bad though  If you
want to look at individual players from this perspective then go ahead 
you'll require the original player stats though

Question
If a team uses  players in a season do you merely divide the total 
by   If so a player who plays in only  game is considered equally
valuable as a player who plays in all of them

Another way of looking at the same thing is to compare the deviation from
the mean for the team of the player to the standard deviation for the team
I'll post both

Since the standard deviation for each team is different I am unsure how 
transferable between teams that these stats are  Shouldn't the average
standard deviation in the league be used

I am interested in seeing each method
But I still think that mine is the best If for no other reason than familiarity

the end of a loss at St Louis on Sunday April   But the league

Not too low perhaps but surely not as high as that of an European NHL
division The Finnish team for example would contain all players currently on
the national team plus a topclass foreigner or two They would be in an
entirely different league than TPS or Jokerit both of whom have perhaps a
dozen players of international class  if even that Why settle for a minor
league when you could have the best

It is no matter what you call the teams Jokerit and TPS or Helsinki Tornado
and Turku Typhoon the best palyers in Finland would eventually end up in
those teams anyway if they were in the big league 


I'd rather spend  Marks to watch the Helsinki Tornado play Montreal the NY
Rangers or Los Angeles than  Marks for the privilege to see Jokerit vs
JypHT or even Djurgardens IF There's nothing like the NHL period

Unrealistic for now Maybe we should first just expand Finnish league to
allow teams from Baltic countries to entry  Then others will get interested
in the idea that maybe one should settle something bigger The ultimate 
goal as you want it would be European Division in NHL Btw does that 
make a final with an Europan team against Norht American

to win the Norris  The Hawks will sweep the Blues in their dreams but will

Smythe Division


Vancouver vs Winnipeg  Jets in 
The Jets have played the Canucks tough the last three games  Everyone is
healthy for the Jets  I'm biased  

Calgary vs Los Angeles  Flames in 
From what I have seen the Kings have looked flat lately  I just can't see
them getting by the Flames

Final Jets in 
The Jets haven't lost to the Flames in '  They will but it will be a
close series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered  I
don't think he'll be  and while it will help it won't be enough

Norris Division


Chicago vs St LouisMinnesota
Chicago in  against the Blues  against the Stars  

Detroit vs Toronto  Wings in 
The Wings should be able to shutdown Gilmour and Andreychuk  Chelvadae is
more experienced than Potvin

Final  Hawks in   Brutal series  Probert and Chelios will go at it
Belfour is better than Chelvadae IMHO

Conference Final  Hawks in   It hurts but the Hawks are more experienced
and that will carry them through to the final

Prince of Wales Conference


Adams Division


Boston vs Buffalo  Bruins in 
B's can check Juneau is darn good and Neely  The Sabres rely too much
on Lafontaine and Mogilny

Quebec vs Montreal  Montreal in 
Classic battle the inexperience will hurt the Nords this year

Final  Bruins in   Habs will be hurting from their series with the Nords
and Boston has been able to control the scorers on the Habs

Patrick Division


Pittsburgh vs IslandersDevils  Pens in 
One word  Mario

Washington vs DevilsIslanders  Caps in   Devils in 
I think the Caps can beat the Isles but not the Devils  Tabaracci has been
strong in goal and if he plays like last year he could carry the team
It doesn't matter though

Final  Pens in   Two more words  Stevens  Jagr

Cup Final  Pens in   Three last words  Tocchet  Murphy  Barrasso

The only thing I don't like about this is that the Pens woofers are going to
be out in full force again  I don't mean the regular Penguin fansit's
just like the bunch around here that if these predictions are true will post
like nuts while the Jets are winning but we won't hear from again when they
lose

 I still am surprised that no one has tried giving away the goodies at the end
 of the game The two problems with that of course are that you would want
 to make sure the first people in the building would be assured of getting
 them probably redeemable vouchers and that the building managers want to
 avoid at all costs delaying people as they leave the building if for
 instance the goodies are given to people as they exit
 
 I went to the New Jersey DevilsCarvel Ice Cream Puck Night tm last year to
 see the beloved Bruins play  The pucks were given out at the end of the game
 I could just imagine what would have happened late in the third if the Bruins
 were winning
 
 It figures after I posted the first article I found out that the Whalers are
 going to be using coupons for the the giveaway on Friday Night I believe that
 is is the Some Big Corporation Probably a Bank Flying Disk Night I think
 that we could all see the potential for danger here
 
  All in all I have seen a whole bunch of giveaways land on the ice and it
  never ceases to amuse me I'm just thankful for the players that no one has
  yet to sponsor 'Lead Pipe Night' at any arenas
 
 That's probably because they couldn't find anyone to sponser it Maybe USS
 could sponser the Pittsburgh PenguinsUS Steel Steel Rod Night close enough
 
 Naah it'd probably bounce off of Jay Caufield

I was at a Cincinnati Cyclones game a year ago when the local country
station sponsored a kazoo giveaway  After a particularly bad call by the
underexperienced ECHL ref it was Kazoostorm time down on the ice  I
thought this was a pathetic display by the fans but they were rightfully
unhappy

Well suffice to say that it is a sport for those able to make the
substantial investment in equipment etc But here's something do 
you think that the availability of inline skates and road hockey
could contribute to a rise in awareness of ice hockey I would
argue this is having an effect here Kids play ice hockey in the

How can you assume it was a sarcastic remark
For someone whose first language is not English I would interpret
that comment to mean that he believes Pat is the MVP on the team and that
he is just one of the other normal players  Quite modest I might say

Well I don't recall assuming anything except perhaps that the columnist 
who reported the incident was telling the truth ie the sarcastic impression
came from him Steve Simmons  Besides to my knowledge Alex has a pretty
fair grasp of the English languageand his recent comment after the Detroit
game would indicate that this remark is what I think it to be  Very low

These players all are pretty good players  They are the depth that the

line guys who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL
They were all important to their clubs  Probably several of these
Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it
were not for the depth provided by these players

They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins  Very good
players who can lead lesser teams FrancisHartford TocchetPhilly who
provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL

As a defensive forward there have been none better than Bob Gainey  That
doesn't mean he was the best player or even the best forward the Canadians
had at that time but he was excellent at what he did  Gainey could
dominate games with his defence  He didn't need to get goals to dominate
He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable  There has never been
anyone any better at doing this  Not ever

Mathew Tasalloti says
chances this year but it seems to me like Washington is the ONLY
team that can stop the Penguins from winning their next Stanley Cup

  Really I think both the Islanders and Devils would have a better chance
at the Penguins than the Capitals IMO

Really  What makes you think the Islanders have a better shot  They
couldn't even beat the Whalers in two games

Yes but as has been mentioned many times before the Islanders play at
the talent level of their opponent  Since Hartford is pitiful the
Islanders played pitiful  Since Pittsburgh is great the Isles will most
likely play great  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor
shooting  To Greg yes I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of
it  Does anyone have shooting percentages  I don't know if that would
help since they often miss the net completely but it might shed some
light on the subject

And my playoff pool is running  Exact rules to be posted tomorrow but
don't hesitate to send in picks

 It is meaningless to compare one player's plusminus statistic with
 another players' out of the context of the role and the playing time
 of the players involved    

It's just as meaningless to compare goals assists PIM and any other stat I
can think of  Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team  The
contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the
same team or different teams  And yet  awards are given and promotions
received based in part on these meaningless stats  The operative words are
in part  stats must be interpreted tempered with other information one
has about the player  


 To compare Jagr's and Francis's plusminus is ridiculous and absurd

And comparing Jagr's and Francis's points is just as ridiculous and absurd
but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals assists points 
for Selanne Lindros Juneau Potvin and the other rookies in the league
and yet

How about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game

Game Summary

I didn't get TV coverage of the game and since it was stormy in these parts
I didn't have the best radio coverage either Here's the box score followed by
a few things I did pick up

First Period
	Hartford Nylander  
	Philadelphia Recchi  Lindros Brind'Amour  pp
Penalties  Verbeek Har holding  Carkner Phi roughing  Houda
Har interference 

Second Period
	Hartford Burt  Cunneyworth Kron 
	Philadelphia Bowen  Eklund Recchi 
	Hartford Nylander  Zalapski Sanderson 
Penalties  Galley Phi majorgame misconduct spearing  Verbeek Har
majorgame misconduct spearing  Brown Phi tripping  Zalapski
Har tripping  Brind'Amour Phi slashing 

Third Period
	Hartford Kron  Sanderson Cassels  pp
	Philadelphia Beranek  Lomakin Yushkevich 
	Philadelphia Faust  Brind'Amour Roussel 
Penalties  Houda Har tripping  Hawgood Phi holding 

Overtime
	Philadelphia Yushkevich  Faust 
Penalties  None

Power Play
	Philadelphia  of  Hartford  of 

Goalies
	Philadelphia Roussel   shots   saves
	Hartford Lenarduzzi    

On the first Hartford goal Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue
line and Nylander stripped him and took off

The Recchi goal was a  on  with Lindros

The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it
ended up behind the goalie

On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in
This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense Take the body and if
they get one shot and beat you fine Don't give them another chance Carkner
Galley and McGill are all terrible about this I'll bet money at least one of
them was the closest FLYER to the play

That's all I have my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it
was that scored much less how

From what I heard Roussel had a very strong game After the game Gene Hart
asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
game It was Garry Galley  for his career high point total I'm surprised
that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play Tommy 
Soderstrom  for his team record tying  shutouts in only about  a season
and Mark Recchi  for his all time high team single season scoring mark
But here's the odd part He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for
number  If he picks Recchi as  after he had a hard time choosing between
him and Lindros doesn't that make Lindros 

What You wanna know my three stars of the season Well since you asked

 Eric Lindros Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice
The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no
accident I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
Recchi There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric
Lindros on it and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey
next season

 Tommy Soderstrom  shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour
and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios booo in front of him He also didn't
play a complete season due to heart problems sentimental edge here my family
has a history of heart problems There's no question in my mind that Tommy
Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if Roussel complains again
about being number  look for him to be traded within  years

 Mark Recchi Again you can't argue with an alltime team high single season
scoring mark There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player
get as many points Plus Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season
Not a tough choice

Honorable mentions Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year The difference was that he wasn't on the top line
this year and didn't get as much playing time Then again he didn't get the
defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either

Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman Yes he made rookie
mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for them I have a feeling
that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up
anything in his own zone and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman
in years to come

Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen Again there are some
things you just can't argue with And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome
he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his
wishes under doctors orders But his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution A little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end
will make him a much more important part of the team next year

Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total
But consistency became a problem for him

A couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members

Tom Misnik a member of the mailing list would like to exchange Email
addresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer

The FLYERS end the season  game below  in th place their best winning
percentage since going  in   within the division th in
Patrick  at home They finished th overall will draft th in
next years entry draft Quebec had the st rounder though They scored as
many goals as they allowed 

The  straight wins is the most since they won  in a row in 

I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey
News that contains them since there are no more games for me to go to I have
no other way of getting them

I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have Knowing
the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time
almost bearable

Here is yet another prediction for them great playoffs
you may laugh at your convenience 

	Adams Division I hate the NE name divisoin

BOS vs BUF   BOS in   the B's are hot lately

MON vs QUE   MON in   This will be the series to watch in the first round


BOS vs MON   MON in   this may be a bit biased but I feel the Canadiens will
		       smarten up and start playing they played two months ago
			 ie bench Savard 
	Patrick Division 

PIT vs NJD   PIT in   It wont be a complete cake walk there be a few lumps
			in the cake batter

WAS vs NYI   WAS in   	This will not be an exciting seriesIMO


PITT vs WAS  PIT in    Washington will be tired after the NYI

	Norris Division

CHI vs StL    CHI in    StL will get a lucky game in

TOR vs DET    TOR in    THis  like MON vs QUE will be another intense 
			 series to watch

CHI vs TOR    TOR in    Potvin will be settling in nicely by this point

	Smythe Division

VAN vs WIN     VAN in   Teemu is great but Vancouver better as a team

CAL vs LAK     CAL in   Gretzky is great but Calgary has been on fire lately
				sorry for the pun um no I am not 

VAN vs CAL     VAN in   This will be a great series but VAN has proven they
			 Will not lie down and get beat

	Wales Conference finals

Pittsburgh vs Montreal    	Montreal in  Montreal IMHO is the only team
					      that has a chance against 
						Pittsburgh

	Campbell Conference finals

Vancouver vs Toronto		Toronto in   Potvin will be series MVP


	STANLEY CUP FINALS  

Toronto Maple Leafs    vs    Montreal Canadiens    
	The Classic Stanley Cup Final matchup also a dream come true

	Montreal wins the Stanley cup in the th game    in double overtime
Roy and Potvin are spectacular throughout the series and share series MVP if 
that is possible Vincent Damphouse nets game winner from a brilliant pass by
Brian Bellows Canadiens star Denis Savard watched his buddies play from the
owners box nursing that splinter on his thumb which has left him on the 
disabled list since the first game of the playoffs awww shucks 

YEE HAA
poof And I wake up 
Well that is my predictionsI hope and dream they come true and you can stop
laughing anytime

 	Adams Division I hate the NE name divisoin
 
 BOS vs BUF   BOS in   the B's are hot lately
 
 MON vs QUE   MON in   This will be the series to watch in the first round
 
 
 BOS vs MON   MON in   this may be a bit biased but I feel the Canadiens will
 		       smarten up and start playing they played two months ago
 			 ie bench Savard 
 	Patrick Division 
 
 PIT vs NJD   PIT in   It wont be a complete cake walk there be a few lumps
 			in the cake batter
 
 WAS vs NYI   WAS in   	This will not be an exciting seriesIMO
 
 
 PITT vs WAS  PIT in    Washington will be tired after the NYI
 
 	Norris Division
 
 CHI vs StL    CHI in    StL will get a lucky game in
 
 TOR vs DET    TOR in    THis  like MON vs QUE will be another intense 
 			 series to watch
 
 CHI vs TOR    TOR in    Potvin will be settling in nicely by this point
 
 	Smythe Division
 
 VAN vs WIN     VAN in   Teemu is great but Vancouver better as a team
 
 CAL vs LAK     CAL in   Gretzky is great but Calgary has been on fire lately
 				sorry for the pun um no I am not 
 
 VAN vs CAL     VAN in   This will be a great series but VAN has proven they
 			 Will not lie down and get beat
 
 	Wales Conference finals
 
 Pittsburgh vs Montreal    	Montreal in  Montreal IMHO is the only team
 					      that has a chance against 
 						Pittsburgh
 
 	Campbell Conference finals
 
 Vancouver vs Toronto		Toronto in   Potvin will be series MVP
 
 
 	STANLEY CUP FINALS  
 
 Toronto Maple Leafs    vs    Montreal Canadiens    
 	The Classic Stanley Cup Final matchup also a dream come true
 
 	Montreal wins the Stanley cup in the th game    in double overtime
 Roy and Potvin are spectacular throughout the series and share series MVP if 
 that is possible Vincent Damphouse nets game winner from a brilliant pass by
 Brian Bellows Canadiens star Denis Savard watched his buddies play from the
 owners box nursing that splinter on his thumb which has left him on the 
 disabled list since the first game of the playoffs awww shucks 
 
 YEE HAA
 poof And I wake up 
 Well that is my predictionsI hope and dream they come true and you can stop
 laughing anytime 
 
 							Paul
 						Die hard Habs Fan living with
 						 Die hard Leafs fans

I only have one comment on this  You call this a classic playoff year
and yet you don't include a ChicagoDetroit series  C'mon I'm a Boston
fan and I even realize that ChicagoDetroit games are THE most exciting
games to watch

Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge
hockey team  The owner of the Admirals sorry I can't remember his name
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
Bradley Center

Lloyd Pettit married into AllenBradley Corp abcom family and owns the
Admirals  He donated the Bradley Center and the new Pettit National Ice
Center

Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise but 
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of  million was too
high

This is not the way I have heard it  See Lloyd as he is affectionately
referred to by Milwaukeeans and Bob Uecker bought the Bradley Center TO get
the NHL to come here

Like I said I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if
it's true don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon  The Admirals
aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club
and a minor league club in the same building especially since the NBA's
Milwaukee Bucks play there as well

Yeah the Bucks the Milwaukee Wave soccer the Admirals the Marquette
Warriors concerts and a bunch of other things

 you mention could cut it as stars in the NHL Even Rexi in his prime was more
 of a good regular in New YorkEdmonton than a superstar in his own right
 although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf

I think that the NY management made a mistake and remember how Edmonton 
called Reksa in the middle of the season to win the cup  Why did they call
him
 
 Yeah we've had a tendency to beat ourselves in the past I almost knifed my
 brother in anger when Sweden scored two in the final minute of the WC 
 semifinals back in  Or what about the three goals Antero Kivela let in
 with five minutes to go against the Russkies in Lake Placid' Ugh    

OK that was BAD luck If Penguins have the same kind of luck this year in
the playoffs they'll never win the cup They are still the best team

Jutila was a failure I think while Makela and Ari Haanpaa had an
onagainoffagain career with the Islanders Both players had to play in the
minors Of course I like our players I just don't think the names
you mention could cut it as stars in the NHL Even Rexi in his prime was more
of a good regular in New YorkEdmonton than a superstar in his own right
although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf


Ruotsaleinen was a more than competent NHL'erhis choice of where
to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability

He was crucial to the Oilers Stanley Cup victory in  the one
without Gretzky because he made an Oiler power play which was
lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive  The
Oilers missed him more the following year than Kurri and I think
the Oilers would have make the finals if Ruotsaleinen has stayed
around the following season and would have beaten Pittsburgh
with Ruotsaleinen and a healthy Messierand delayed Pittsburgh's
dynasty by a season

the average hockey fans That doesn't mean they're always right

hardly anyone believes that right now

  It's hard to be humble when you're perfect

Well as long as we're being unduly cocky here It's obvious that the Pens
will cone out of the Patrick Division not the Caps and also that
they will win thier third Stanley Cup Collective Wisdom is a very polite
way of putting it I don't know if I'd be so gracious
And for what it's worth Probably not much I think the Habs will come out of
the Adams too

I found this press release from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice on
another system and thought it would be of interest on campuses 
where the administration or the athletics department wants to 
eliminate the women's ice hockey team

 Women Athletes TLP Win Sex Discrimination Ruling Brown University
Ordered to Restore Two Women's Varsity Teams
To National Desk Sports Writer
 Contact Lynette Labinger  home  or
          Ray Marcaccio  both of Trial Lawyers For
          Public Justice

   WASHINGTON April   The US Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit in Boston has upheld a US District Court
order requiring Brown University to immediately reinstate its women's
gymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status The ruling in
Cohen et al v Brown University is the first appeals court decision
in the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics  Trial
Lawyers for Public Justice TLPJ is the national public interest
law firm representing the women athletes
   This ruling makes clear what we have said all along  if a
school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of
opportunities to participate they can only eliminiate men's teams
said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant cocounsel in the case
   The class action filed April  charged Brown with violating
Title IX of the Education Amendments of  the federal law that
prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions
receiving federal funds  Brown terminated the two women's teams as
universityfunded sports in May  allowing them to continue to
compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for
uniforms travel coaches and all other expenses  They had also
been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members
   This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights
said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney 
Labinger  Universities across America need to reevaluate their
programs quickly Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced
   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision  Colorado State
University Indiana University of Pennsylvania IUP and Colgate
University are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders
requiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity
teams  Continuing its cuttingedge Title IX activities TLPJ is
representing women athletes at IUP
   In addition to Labinger and Bryant TLPJ's legal team included
Ray Marcaccio of Blish  Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell DeLuca
 Schwartz in Providence and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia  The
National Women's Law Center Women's Sports Foundation and National
Association for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in
support of TLPJ's appeal

It seemed pretty conclusive to me  The puck clearly hit the crossbar
and then came down on the line  And the announcers admittedly homers
kept harping about how they must have had a different view upstairs
because it was obvious to them and I would have thought to anyone who
saw the replay that the puck didn't go in  The referee originally 
signalled no goal but the video replay judges initiated contact with
the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored  This to me is
unheard of  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about
the Leaf chances this year

cordially as always

un you better add at least another plus to the Pederson
for Neely trade the Bruins also received a number  round
draft pick didn't play great this year but Wesley's still a
decent defenseman  And the Bruins got Pederson back eventually
anyway

Well I just read in the Boston Globe that while not confirming
or denying anything Walsh may end up with the Rangers organizations
as an assistant Coach  Keenan has talked with Walsh in the past
he came up to see Kariya as he will be coaching him in the worlds
funny I guess he got to watch the Ferraro brothers as well I'm
not sure if walsh will go but if Keenan is getting  and walsh
even gets  that's a  pay raise for walsh not to mention
a nice career move Anyone from New York Hear anything about
this

In Aprhubcapclemsonedu jwodziadliteuucp john wodziak writes

Sorry Roger but Mr Basketbal should what he really means here IE he should
have said that he hopes fans in the American Southeast can follow the
names of the divisions The odds that these people other than those who
are displaced Notherners who are probably already fans is on the order
of the proverbial snowball's in hell

I am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here   If  you
asked  somone  who  had never heard of hockey before if LA played in
the Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be
What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division  The
naming of  divisions  after  longdead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary
obfuscation

I am glad that the names are being changed for another reason  The names
Patrick Smythe Norris Adams and Campbell are all the names of socalled
builders of the game  This is the same type of thinking that put Stein
in the Hall of Fame  This is absolute nonsense  The real builders of the
game are Richard Morenz Howe Conacher Orr etc  If you are going to
name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people
who deserve it

Yes these people deserve recognigtion as hockey greats but the old division
names took into account Messers Patrick Norris Smythe and the Prince who 
had alot more to do with the ORIGINS of the league than people who came into
an already established situation It is much easier to be an element of change

Hardly  The established situation existed prior to Smythe  et  al
The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team
could successfully mount the challenge  What our  dear  founders  did
was formalize the challenge  They created a closed league an oligop
olistic professional system in the interests of making money  Wheth
er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly
debatable  We are however stuck with their invention and  that  de
bate  is  academic   The  point  to  be made however is that people
played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe
and his pals showed up

or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates
a new situation  If you want to honor players like Bobby Orr than I'm sure
you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive 
defenseman

What's wrong with best defenceman period  Was there  ever  a  better
defenceman   Was  there  ever a better player  And if you think that
Bruce Norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby
Orr's  then  in the interests of education why don't you take a poll
and find out how many people know who Norris was  But you don't  have
to do you

No I can't for the reasons I gave above I'm in the same boat as Jason and I
grew up with the current divisonal names and learned them when I was about 
 years old and who played in what division If a  year old American
can learn this why would it be hard for an Occasional Fan to pick up 
on who plays in what division

So you don't feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember
that  Vancouver  plays in the West division  Or Pacific or whatever
other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen

Oh  Now I see your point  Your intention has been to alert us to the erosion
of purity  I'll bet you like hockey because it's for the most part played
by whites of European extraction 

Probably not In my case I'm sure of this What you said would be like me
saying that All Maple Leafs fans are as biased closed minded ignorant

And of course you neatly deleted Jason's  jingoistic  rant  about  the
game  losing  its  Canadianization   Quoting me out of context does
more to erode your credibility than it  does  mine   My  position  is
clearly  progressive  and  is anything but biased closed minded ig
norant  Arrogant I will grant you

arrogant and moronic as you  Just because someone A doesn't like what
Mr Basketball is doing B voices their opinion and C Likes the senerio of
you going to Antartica does not mean that you have the right to insult them

Nice try John  But for a flame to be truly effective you have to
display  at  least  enough  intelligence  to  earn  your target's
respect

cordially as always

	STANLEY CUP FINALS
Toronto Maple Leafs    vs    Montreal Canadiens    
	The Classic Stanley Cup Final matchup also a dream come true
	Montreal wins the Stanley cup in the th game    in double overtime

You know after I finished laughing I thought  This would be a great
final  Two Canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that Don Cherry
nonsense behind them and a nailbiter finish

Of course I would prefer a VancouverMontreal final with Vancouver
scoring the final goal

Pity neither will happen

A fine  year history came to a close tonight as the Minnesota North Stars 
or Norm's Stars whichever you prefer lost to the Red Wings by a score of
  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen who netted
two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to
play


Yes it's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best
hockey markets in the country  Being a North Stars fan it is sad to
see all of the tradition of the last  years get thrown into oblivion
at the hands of a truly crappy owner

Hopefully the NHL will install an expansion franchise in the Twin Cities
within the next five years  Even if this is the case a lot has been
lost in the North Stars move

CENTERS
Mark Messier N Y Rangers

Messier was not invited due to his nagging injuries  While the press
made an issue of it and attempted to link it to the Rangers' internal
political woes Mike Keenan repeated that to Messier personally during
the MSG press conference  It makes sense  Messier would probably
have not declined the invitation if it were made for publicity

The subject line says it all  Is it terribly difficult to get tickets
to Penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  Would
it be easy to find scalpers outside of the Igloo selling tickets

Locked away waiting for the tapedelay to start 

It's nice that the Devils are starting out their playoffs on network
television  too bad that their playoff game has been preempted on
WABCAM for an earlyseason Yankees baseball game

It's a  win by the Texas Rangers  and they're delaying the
tapedelay by another halfhour for the ballgame highlights

 The subject line says it all  Is it terribly difficult to get tickets
 to Penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  Would
 it be easy to find scalpers outside of the Igloo selling tickets
 
 Dean Money
 dmoneymagnusacsohiostateedu

     Here is my traditional experience with tickets playoffs and otherwise
at the Civic Arena

     Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena  Best 
strategy given that you don't mind missing the Anthem which is OK if BE
Taylor decides to come back ever again   is to wait until  or 
when the game is rolling the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell
and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets

     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on 
what's left at  may be nosebleed material D E sections

Others can add on their opinions as well

I got back from my trip to discover that my email spool file got blown
away  I am missing all the playoff pool entries sent between April 
and April   It looks like about  entries got lost  Sigh

Therefore I would like to ask each person that sent me a team to resend
it ASAP  I am relying on your honesty to not make changes after the
deadline today

Thanks in advance and I apologize for the problem

You think that's bad  I'm in Bowling Green OH and we get ABC from
Toledo  Well the cable co decided to totally preempt the game no tape
delay no nothing for a stupid telethon  Hockey is very big around here
too  I had to listen to my Penguins win on my car radio out in the
parking lot  I can just be thankful for a strong radio because being 
miles from Pittsburgh the reception usually isn't good at all  I can't
believe I picked it up during the middle of the day

  The Blues scored two powerplay goals in  seconds in the third period
and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks  Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium
Brendan Shanahan tied the game  and Brett Hull scored the game winner 
seconds later Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals
Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks who also had some very good
goaltending from Ed Belfour Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the
stretch to preserve the Blues lead

The Hawks came out strong in the first period outshooting the Blues  and
taking a  lead on Noonan's first goal Right after an interference penalty
on Rick Zombo had expired Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the
blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle Larmer fired
a long slap shot and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads After
the goal the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks
 in the first period

Jeff Brown tied the game  at  of the second Nelson Emerson broke in on
the left side got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot Belfour
came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards where Brown
collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal

Two minutes later on a Hawks power play Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a
shorthanded breakin Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy
Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass
across the slot Noonan fired it past Joseph at  for the  lead

Noonan completed his hat trick  later to increase the Hawks' lead to 
Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat
Stephane Quintal by driving to the net Joseph had no chance as Noonan
deflected the puck in the net

Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to  at  after picking up the
rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot Janney set up McRae for
the shot and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards
to Felsner Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net The Blues
outshot the Hawks  in the second period

With the Blackhawks leading  at  of the third Stephane Matteau picked
up a high sticking penalty Just  seconds into the power play Steve Smith
was called for slashing giving the Blues a on advantage for 

The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just  seconds into
the twoman advantage to tie the game  Janney found Hull in the slot
and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour Jeff Brown collected the rebound and
passed it to Shanahan in the left circle Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp
angle

Just  seconds later Hull scored the game winner for the Blues Nelson
Emerson broke in on right wing carried the puck behind the net along with
two Hawks defensemen Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the
slot and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 

The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes but Joseph
made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring He stopped Troy
Murray point blank from just right of the crease with  left in the game
The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play with Rich Sutter clearing the
puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line The Blues held
on to win the game The Hawks oushot the Blues  in the third period
totaling  shots on goal for each team The Blues special teams were excellent
in the game The Blues killed  of  Hawks power plays and scored twice on
on four power play chances The Blues ranked among the best special teams in
the league They rank nd in penalty killing and rd on the power play
 
The game was carried live on ABC the first time an NHL game other than an
AllStar game has been shown on network television since May   when
CBS carried Game  of the Stanley Cup finals

That's stupid  I'd complain to the television network  If I were to even
see a Pirates game on instead of a Penguins game at this time of the year I
and many other Pittsburghers would surely raise hell

It's a  win by the Texas Rangers  and they're delaying the

Red Wings vs Maple Leafs               Maple Leafs in 

  Comment  It's kind of tough to rely on Yzerman as the team's main weapon
            He's a great palyer but Dino knows all about choking which
            puts the burden on Steve even more  Potvin's had a hell of a
            season and goaltending is what you need in the playoffs

For a great prognosticator you seem to remember very little playoff
history Dino always shows up in the playoffs which is why he is a
great sleeper pick in pools Don't forget about Fedorov one of the
top players in the NHL IMHO and Coffey who has the most Stanley Cup
rings of any active players correct me if I'm wrong Wings in a
cakewalk

Oh yeah how come Dino could never take the Caps out of the Patrick
Division  He choked up  games to  last year and got swept away in
the second round two years ago  He rarely if ever makes it out of the
division

Canucks vs Jets                        Canucks in 

  Comment  It's more like Vancouver vs Selanne  King and Domi for
            enforcing help Winnipeg out a little maybe a game  Canucks
            have their number

Except that the Canuck are playing like shit Winnipeg can win this
one though I think Vancouver will manage to slip by

So are the Islanders but they can still pull it out  Vancouver has Winnipeg's
 number so it really doesn't matter

Flames vs Kings                        Flames in 

  Comment   games looks good as the Kings always seem to battle it out
            Flames are back in running and won't know memories of last year's
            season  Gretzky is on a tear but there are too many 
            surrounding the Kings

Kings always seem to battle it out When Where

 Kings always seem to go at least  or  they never play a four or five
game serious  There's a difference between battling it out and pulling it
out as I take Calgary to pull it out in

Summary UMass hires Head Coach for first season since 
Keywords UMass Minutemen Mallen
XNewsreader TIN version  PL



The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway At the   PM Saturday
afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena  former
Boston College Asst Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the  year year
contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen 

Mallen was the third viable pick for the position right behind Jeff Jackson
Lake Superior and second behind Shawn Walsh UMaine Previous offers for 
the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst coaches of
Brown RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians

UMass hockey was disbanded in  due to financial constraints that had
undermined the team's position over a period of years In late November
of last year the  million Mullins Sports Center was opened following
its one year construction deadline 

The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div IIDiv III schedule this
upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 
season Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or
potential team candidates for the Minutemen  it is expected that he will
leverage off his inside contacts within New England the Bay State and
Europe to draw on competitive top ice players for the University

UMass has slated  hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester  
expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources

The subject line says it all  Is it terribly difficult to get tickets
to Penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  Would
it be easy to find scalpers outside of the Igloo selling tickets

There are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena  You might have
to pay a few bucks extra but you can always find them  Look on the
street under the message board or out on the street in front of the Hyatt
or even around Gate   The later you buy them the less money you'll pay
and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face
value or below if you wait until game time  Might be better to pick them
up earlier now though

I might not be great in Math but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points
with different record Manretard Can't believe people actually put

Why not I believe both the Devils and Islanders got  points
Say for example another team had this record  
they had  which is the same as their points total
The Islanders' and Devils' records are both 

It is simple arithmetics and involve no Calculus

How was this trade bad I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty
good centre  right wing combination and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the
deal and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else After the trade the 
Bruins were in two finals and one semifinal all of which of course they 
lost to Montreal which should please you to no end I doubt however keeping
Esposito would have made a difference in those series as he did not for
the Rangers in ' or any of his years in Boston for that matter

Well put Jason  I am not from Wisconsin but I have close relatives who
live in Port Washington about  minutes north of Milwaukee I visit the
city regularly and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals
play  and the NCAA Hockey Championships  It is a beautiful building  The
Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in
North America
As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a
franchise word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown
County Arena
Once again the Admirals are an independent franchise and the people of
Milwaukee have been supporting them well  The games I have been to have seen
crowds anywhere from  to  which are numbers some NHL teams ie
the Islanders Hartford New Jersey would be envious of having on some nights
Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without
the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount
of hockey interest exists in the city

Sincerely

Martin Hill Rt  Box B Sault Ste Marie MI Home of LSSU  Go Lakers

PS  Anybody know what the attendance figures are for the IHL and how
Milwaukee stacks up against other IHL cities such as Atlanta Phoenix San
Diego Cleveland and Cincinnati  If so please reply

I can live with the other changes that have been made eg the playoff format
change but the change to the division and conference names really annoys me
Batman was on TSN last night saying that changing the names would make the
game easier for the occasional fan to follow  He should have said what he
meant that changing the names will make the game easier for Americans in 
nonhockey cities to follow  I don't know of too many of my friends who had 
a hard time following which teams were in each division Even a minimal amount
of exposure to the game allows a person to quickly pick up on this

There is nothing wrong with making the game easier for Americans to
follow  The more fans the merrier and even if you dislike the occasional
fan there is always the chance that these fans will become fanatics

I am glad that the names are being changed for another reason  The names
Patrick Smythe Norris Adams and Campbell are all the names of socalled
builders of the game  This is the same type of thinking that put Stein
in the Hall of Fame  This is absolute nonsense  The real builders of the
game are Richard Morenz Howe Conacher Orr etc  If you are going to
name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people
who deserve it

	I think that you are incorrect Roger  Patrick
Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
front office types  Hence they did help build the league although
they were not great players themselves  

	I agree that a name is a name is a name and if some people
have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans
then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like
a reasonable idea  If we can get people in the arena door by being
uncomplicated then let's do so  Once we have them they will realize
what a great game hockey is and we can then teach them something
abotu the history of the game  
 
The history of the names can be put rather succinctly  All of the aforemen
tioned used the game of hockey to make money  Can you imagine a Pocklington
division  A Ballard division  Or how about a Green division

	No I would not want to see a Ballard division  But to say
that these owners are assholes hence all NHL management people are
assholes would be fallacious  Conn Smythe for example was a classy
individual from what I have heard 

	Also isn't the point of professional hockey to make money
for all those involved which would include the players  What I think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
should have been their due and it is the players that are what make
the game great not the people who put them on the ice so naming
division after management people rather than players is adding insult
in the form of lesser recognition to injury less money than was
deserved

Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than
those of the above combined  Should we name a division or trophy after
him  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they
were powerful owners  As owners they certainly did help to build the
league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether
Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution
or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the 
sport itself

I can't disagree with you here

	No I would not want to see a Ballard division  But to say

individual from what I have heard 

What have you heard  The Major was the definitive little asshole  He
originated the phrase if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat
'em on the ice  That was his idea of hockey  Do you think by chance
that Don Cherry is a classy individual

	Also isn't the point of professional hockey to make money
for all those involved which would include the players  What I think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as

The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on and
that is it is the players that are what make the game great and not the
people who put them on the ice

Exactly true  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch
is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame  I have
always thought that this was nonsense

     Depends on what you mean by classy From what I've heard about
him he was about as classy as Harold Ballard  Only difference was
that back then almost all the owners were like that so he seemed okay
by comparison  Read the book Net Worth for one view of what Smythe
and Norris and Adams and Campbell were like

     Even more specifically I think what Roger was saying and I said
it previously too is that these are NOT the people who made the
league great so why should divisions conferences etc be named after
them instead of Morenz Vezina Howe Orr etc the people who DID
make it great  Instead the NHL has chosen to immortalize the men who
got rich off of the men who made the game great

everywhere that I've sampled  in fact the playoffs almost don't
exist now  Ranger fans calling in to WFAN or to New York One's
midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near
orgasm over Keenan's hiring  Summarizing Keenan is a winner and
will give the Broadway Bums 'da business' in pursuing the next Cup
chase 

	The Chicago Blackhawks cut their last tie with Keenan when
he was forced out as general manager in November He had given up
Chicago's coaching duties a year ago and his thirst for the power
of a GM now increases the pressure on beleaguered Rangers GM Neil
Smith

This will be an interesting combination to watch  Keenan has been
paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach but his
advice on any player moves will be listened to closely  A lot of big
player moves will happen  remember that Keenan got rid of Denis
Savard  The country club days are over 

	When Keenan left Chicago I couldn't help but think about 
him as our coach'' Smith said There was an indication he would 
be taken off the market I feared that and couldn't let that happen''

If Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offered
Keenan the big money to putupandshutup back in January the
Rangers might not be heading for golf now 

	Keenan  takes on a demoralized team that offers him a
chance to fashion yet another of his reclamation projects  at the
highest salary ever commanded by an NHL coach The Rangers  owned
by Gulf  Western  have bestowed upon Keenan an unprecedented 
million fouryear deal

	I've known Mike a long time'' Messier said We've won two
Canada Cups together He's been to the finals three times Maybe we
miss just one more element to win the Stanley Cup I don't think he's
the same person he was  years ago or even five years ago I think he
has changed and bettered himself with experience''

One of Keenan's first statements was a reaffirmation that Mark Messier
will be the team's captain

	The timing of the move gives the Rangers' new coach  
months to prepare for the NHL draft June  and Neil Smith may 
not back off the their tradehappy pattern

By then Smith might have some bargains on Keenan's advice  like
maybe unloading Phil Bourque for Tie Domi

	Was the ABC coverage of the KingsFlames game supposed to be the
way it was shown in BC with CBC overriding the ABC coverage  When I flipped
to ABC it was the same commentators same commercials even  My question
is  Was this the real ABC coverage or did CBC just black out the 
ABC coverage for its own

	CBC had a great chance for some double headers  TorontoDetroit
and VancouverWinnipeg but today they said that the East gets the Leafs
and the West get the Vancouver game  I thought that they would show them
both

Toronto to the Cup finals

First of all has anyone on the planet heard of the team from Detroit  Al
Morgani or however you spell the idiot's name must be from Chicago
because on ESPN he said it's not even closeChicago will definatly win
the Norris Division in the Playoffs no other team is close  Everyone is
picking Chicago  I don't get it he says it's an easy choice
God Chicago was  against the Wings and they won the division by a
point or two followed closely by Toronto who is also a good team
As for the Leafs beating Detroitdoubt it but even if they do they
aren't going to get by Chicago  If even more amazingly they get past the
Hawks they would probably face Vancouver and lose
As for The Habs reaching the Finals forget it  Even I as a devoted Wings
fan will watch the Penguins easily threepeat as Cup winners  Lemieux
Jagr Tocchet Stevens and Barrasso its a done deal  Sorry Detroit wait
til next year
But hey these were Paul's picks and everyone has a right to their own
opinnions but the Leafs to the Finals Yeah If they make it there I'll
walk to Toronto to get some tickets and that's a  mile walk

And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded

The Leafs have always been kind of comical  During the second  Imlach
era when Darryl Sittler was called a cancer on the team he tore the
C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain

Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly
captaincy  by  new  GM  and Sittler's friend Bobby Clarke  Instead
Sittler got traded to Detroit

Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and
they took the captaincy away from him  Then he was traded to Chicago

During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach in an  attempt  to  kiss
the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman the Leafs took the A away from Brad
Marsh to give to Leeman  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried
to give it back to Marsh he wouldn't take it neither

The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman late
of the Senators  While he was in Philadelphia Bobby Clarke arguably
one of the great captains of all time was bumped up to the status  of
playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy  Bridgman be
came the new captain  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a
captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the
players  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making
sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full

	Are people here stupid or what It is a tie breaker of cause they
have to have the same record How can people be sooooo stuppid to put win as

different record Man I thought people in this net are good with hockey
I might not be great in Math but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points
with different record Manretard Can't believe people actually put
win as first in a tie breaker

Golly I love stupid people 
Listen Rex this is hockey  The NHL to be precise  And in the NHL
there exist these things called ties  A tie occurs when a game ends
with the score for each team equal  Each team gets one point for a tie 
There also exits these things called wins  A win is when one team has a
higher score than the opponent  Oh yeah only two teams play each other
at a time so I can say the opponent  A team gets two points for a
win  So let's say that a team has a record of  wins  losses and 
ties  Another team has a record of  wins  losses and  ties  The
first team has    points  The second team has   
points  WOW  They both have the same number of points but the number
of wins is different  How did they do that  That's amazing  So
Rex when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker well then
that's what it means  In our example the second team would win the
tiebreaker and therefore have the better record even though both teams
had the same number of points  If you didn't understand this post Rex
maybe you should go back and read it again very slowly

Well it's not that bad But I am still pretty pissed of at the
local ABC coverage They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing
David Brinkley at  instead of an earlier time slot I don't
even understand their problem If they didnt think enough people would

not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game And
if they showed the remaining  hours of the game would it hurt to play
David Brinkley at its regular time They dont have any decent programming
before noon anyway I called the sports dept and blasted them on their
machine I called gain and someone picked it up When I asked him why they
premepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs he seemed a bit
confused When I explained a bit more in detail he then said that's upto
to our programming dept call back on  Monday weel I understand that the
sports dept is not responsible for this preemption BUt I can't understand
how someone in the sports dept can't even recognise the name of playoffs
shown on the very same station he works for

Anyway I am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again
I urge all Atlanta hockey fans to call WSB  and ask them not to do the
same thing for the next  weeks

Aargh

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the NHL
He called a total of  penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques
The Nords' penalty came in OT  Stewart being an exNordique himself
was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murderWE WAS ROBBED

It was an excellent game with plenty of endtoend rushes and tremendous
goalkeeping  The Nords tied it with over  minute to go while Lebeau
was serving a penalty  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the
last  min of the game but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT  The Nords were
caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once  Stewart turned
the other cheekBASTARD

Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal He was shaky and
on his knees for the rest of the night  The winning goal shouldn't have
gone in

Don't get me wrong I'm not blaming the loss on Stewart  The Habs had
plenty of chances to capitalize Muller LeClair Haller etc but
failed to put the puck in the net  That's what did them in  But
Mr Stewart didn't help matters at all

Oh well at least the Bruins lost in OT also Ha Ha

A fine  year history came to a close tonight as the Minnesota North Stars 
or Norm's Stars whichever you prefer lost to the Red Wings by a score of
  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen who netted
two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to
play

Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell 
from the twin cities In an earlier post it was announced that Norm 
Green was given until midnight of the last homegame of the North Stars
to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena 
Did this happen Was Norm runoutoftown

Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board 
the scoreboard fell to the ice and flattened Mr Greedy to a large
piece of green paper Arena management had to use the Zamboni which 
they confiscated from Norm's truck to cleanup the useless remains

While it's nice that the NHL is back on American network TV it faces

As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon
dropping a  decision to the LA Kings Most of the Flames neglected
to show up especially in their own zone as the Kings hit at least
five posts The Flames best line was probably
SkrudlandPaslawskiBerube which tells how bad the Flames were Gary
Suter scored a great goal in fact all three Flame goals were scored
by Dmen  Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others but also made
some bonehead plays For the Kings Pat Conacher was especially
impressive 

The games was VERY chippy as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and
never recovered it there were highsticks crosschecks punches
hits from behind Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren
Rychel from behind Flames dominated the game physically but failed
to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses I don't think
Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals Calgary went with  Dmen
as Roger Johansson played LW he looked lost IMHO  I hope King
inserts Chris Lindbergh Paul Kruse or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's
game Gretzky left the game in the nd period with a charleyhorse no
idea how serious  he didn't return

I still think the Flames should win this series but they better
buckle down

This game would have been great as part of a doubleheader on ABC or

Le Magnifique and The Great One  Unfortunately the only network
that would have done that was SCA seen in few areas and hard to

have not declined the invitation if it were made for publicity 


Actually Messier was invited but declined due to nagging injuries
Keenan and Messier have always gotten alongKeenan dumped Steve

Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the
Toronto Sun It featured a picture of Don who just saw his shadow
and proclaimed Will you look at dat eh Means another  weeks
of me Beauty

Next Don talked about the hot dog he was holding According to
him the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all
the arenas in the NHL

From there Don commented on the QuebecMontreal game The game
had great flow because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game
in the NHL In contrast the CalgaryLA game was terrible All
stopandgo over  minutes of penalties called against Calgary
by Dan Marouelli Its getting so that the ref who calls the most
penalties gets to ref in the finals

Next Ron showed an old picture of Don when he was playing for
the Rochester Americans of the AHL Don recalled some of the
wins that he had in the Quebec arena during the Memorial cup
and the AHL championships

Finally Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the
Rangers The rangers were a talented team who underachieved
Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith who had
several key injuries to Leetch and Patrick and goalies who
went cold

Don had some criticism for the Rangers team The party's over
Adolf Keenan is there The Rangers organization will no longer
be a 'country club' NY should be achamed of themselves If
they go in the tank with Adolf there they'll be hanging from the
yardarm by their thumbs

 	Was the ABC coverage of the KingsFlames game supposed to be the
 way it was shown in BC with CBC overriding the ABC coverage  When I flipped
 to ABC it was the same commentators same commercials even  My question
 is  Was this the real ABC coverage or did CBC just black out the 
 ABC coverage for its own
 
 

Here in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island for you furriners out there we
got the ABC coverage on KOMO  It probably depends on your cable company

I started off switching between the CBC and ABC broadcasts but finally
settled on ABC  I can't stand Don Whitman and Al Michaels was doing a
decent job  He followed the play pretty well knew all the players'
names and only made a couple of rookie mistakes that I noticed
One thing that surprised me is that they never once attempted to explain
the offside rule

AmIparanoidoristhisreallyhappening department
There were no fights in the game but there were a couple of occasions
where it looked like a fight was about to start  Both times ABC cut
away to show a closeup of a coach or McNall or something  Has ABC
decided to adopt the Spicer policy

I also think that they will have a hard time with Pittsburgh if they
face them in the finals which is what all the Detroit sportswriters 
are predicting  Although I think Bryan Murray is probably the best GM
I have ever seen in hockey

How do you figure that  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were
a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked
unlikely to win it  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it  A truly great GM would
have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup  A good GM like Murray can
maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level

In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray
way too many to name  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today
He fails in comparison to Sinden Sather Savard Caron Fletcher and
Quinn in my estimation

I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen
in hockey unless they have seen VERY few GM's

Dusseldorf YES although the arena is an anachronism an OPEN wall behind one

Malmo is big enough but they also need a new arenathe current one has

 Finland       Helsinki Turku Tampere

If we're talking about the NHL even Helsinki would struggle to make it work
Turku despite an excellent arena and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for
major league hockey

 Italy         Milan

showed no interest whatsoever All teams in the Italian league come from Milan
and the smaller cities in the north

 France        Paris Chamonix Ruoen

Paris had their own Volans Francaissp pro team a couple of years ago
I believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals 
tournament one year but eventually folded due to lowerthanhopedfor

sport like hockey

 Norway        Oslo
 Austria       Vienna Villach
 Chech         Prag
 Slovakia      Bratislava
 Russia        Moscow St Petersburg

The easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey

 Great Britain 

Perhaps    Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning
anyway playing in a small  seat arena backed by Japanese money run by 
enthusiasts Phil Esposito heavy
marketing fans that have difficulty telling what icing means London has
been mentioned Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new

 Netherlands   

No facilities to speak of their biggest arena in Eindhoven seats  
fans for hockey

The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to
prevent goals from being scored not to score them  When
Lemieux or Gilmour play their number one purpose is to score
defence is secondary especially considering the line that
plays against them is probably a defensive one  That is why
they are not Selke candidates
Gainey is the best defensive forward ever  I stand by that
assessment He was a very good player who belongs in the hall
of fame  Did you ever watch him play He never made a
technical error
 
I watched him over his entire career  I have NEVER seen a
player and that includes Russell Courtnall and Davie Keon
screw up as many breakaways as Bob Gainey  And I will never
forget the time Denis Potvin caught Gainey with his head down 
You have been sold a bill of goods on Bob Gainey
 
It was Bryan Trottier not Denis Potvin  It was a vicious

But Roger what the hell does this have to do with Gainey's skill

 	MONCTON HAWKS
 See CD Islanders Moncton is a very similar team to CDI Low scoring
 defensive good goaltending John Leblanc and Stu Barnes are the only
 noticable guns on the team But the defense is top notch and 
 Mike O'Neill is the most underrated goalie in the league
 

 Bri as I have tried to tell you since  February Michael O'Neill
 might be the most underrated goalie in the AHL but he ISN'T in the
 AHL  He's on the Winnipeg Jets' injury list as he has been since
 his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators  He's out until
 next year after surgery to repair a shoulder separation

 Stu Barnes might be an AHL gun for the Hawks but he's now the third
 line center with the Jets and has been since mid January or so

Sorry my memory is gone I thought that O'Neill got sent back
down in February but I must have been given incorrect info I guess
this says it all about Moncton because Barnes is still one of
their top  or so scorers even though he's been out since January

 Lemieux is clearly the MVP

No question here  Chip in the Masterson as well

 Selanne wins the Calder

Yep 

 Chelios the Norris

If you asked me  days ago I'd agree with you  I now give the nod to
Raymond Bourque his play took off the same time the B's did  Chelios
gets a close second

 dunno who wins the Vezina but I suspect not Potvin  
  
Barrasso finally gets his due in a close one over Eddie the Eagle

 Coach of the year is tricky  Burns did the most with the least raw talent
 King did a good job but the Flames clearly underachieved last year Brian
 Sutter has done exceptionally well in his first year with a new team ditto
 Demers Page has been blessed by the ripening and acquisition of young
 talent Darryl Sutter is having a good year for a rookie coach Berry made
 the best of a bad situation Terry Crisp worked minor miracles and Bowman
 was Bowman  I'd pick Burns but I'm mildly biased

In your case that bias is acceptable  Mine shows with the Norris pick
so we're even

I'm impressed with what all the coaches you mentioned did but my pick would be 
Al Arbour  Not too many folks thought the Isles would be in the playoffs let 
alone contend for rd in their division Granted that they did have a little
help from their cousins on Broadway 

And I like the Islanders about as much as I like mowing my lawn

Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team  And that is
simply because there are not enough solid twoway players to go

or Mario as my checking centres  Do you think Gretzky could cover
Bob Gainey 

any team  The Selke is designed to acknowledge their
contributionI think that most people understand that it's not

You're wrong again  The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the
best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger  If 
Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he 
should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen
sively

Settle down  If you think that I have likened the Selke to the Nobel

down before you bother following up on my postings

Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by  thinking
wishful thoughts but being totally off the ball

The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe
for those that don't know the best teams from lower divisions get
promoted and the worst get demoted

Would European fans put up with our if you've paid you can play 
attitude

How long would they support teams that are run on Rangerbased 
corporate thinking I use the term lightly  We don't need a good
product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa's
record every year haha sorry had ta say it

If hockey and other pro sports had a similar system to Europe maybe
teams like the Rangers would be forced to compete or get demoted the fourth 
division  We'd have many more teamscentres that aren't as big like
Halifax or Adirondackok so Halifax isn't a good example would 
eventually get promoted and every team would be somewhat competetive within
its own division unlike Ottawa SJ Edmonton etc Fans would eventually
get rewarded for their loyalty or penalized for their neglect and the
league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx
of newly promoted teams and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley CupI can
dream can't I

Look at British or any European soccer as an example they never have fan
problems

   Carol Alt Head Coach In 

I wish  She can be my head coach any time  Sorry Ali  Back to
real hockey

Hmmmmmm I think I'll let everyone make there own comment on this one


THE BAD
 
Alexei Kovalev
What did the Rangers think when they signed him Did they think he
was another Domi  Just let him play And not on a th line  Better
that he stays in the minors and gets icetime ALL the time

Whose bad  It has been Neilson and Smith's decision to play him there
if that's what you mean then that's bad  But Kovalev himself is a very
good player  You're right if he weren't stranded on the fourth line
maybe he'd produce  Sound familiar  Darren Turcotte

Neilson and Smith are bad Kovalev is magical

 So Roussel was giving up almost another goal a game while facing a proportional
 number of shots for the number of minutes he played and while I have't
 actually checked I believe that he faced a lower quality of opponent
 
 Make that less than half a goal a game  The lower quality of opponet
 argument is immaterial as neither Roussel nor Soderstrom had any say in
 the matter  That was Dineen's decision

So in other words if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out
the Penguins that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision Come on
Joe think about what you're saying Who they played is VERY significant
Why they played them is what's irrelevent A low GAA against good teams
is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two
goaltenders A low GAA is better then a higher GAA A low GAA against good
teams is much much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context
of comparing two goaltenders

  The fact of the matter is that despite last nights shutout he doesn't
  have what it takes Last night was due to an inept Ranger team much more
  than Roussel's skill A  on  and they don't get a shot away A  on none
  and one guy just passes and stops the other guy shoots into Roussel's pad
 
 C'mon Pete  So the Rangers were inept  A shutout is a shutout  During
 both of Soderstrom's masterpieces against Toronto Mike Emerich was quoted
 as saying he didn't think the Leafs had much offensive firepower past their
 first line  Does that make Soderstrom's shutouts less impressive because of
 Toronto's lack of offense

YES IT DOES Absolutely In the context of comparing two goaltenders
Of course at the end of the season  points is  points no matter how you
get them And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts But if you're a
coach deciding between two goalies or a GM looking to make a trade you
have got to look deeper than the stat sheets I didn't see the second Toronto
game but the first one was a defensive masterpiece There was nothing in
that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested The same
for Roussel in the Ranger game Two real scoring chances one he made a
great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player If
you were judging Roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by

But if you were to look at the  tie against the Habs you saw a goalie
stand on his head to get that shutout THAT was a  goalie in action Roussel
doesn't have a game like that in him

 Well if you look back to November when Roussel was the  goalie Soderstrom
 was being treated for his heart ailment  The Flyers finished November at
  and were  overall  And there's no way of knowing where the Flyers
 would have finished if Soderstom wasn't wearing the oragne 'n black  I'm glad
 we don't have to find out anytime soon either because he is one hell of a
 player  I would take him over Roussel right now but I still think Dom has
 what it takes to be the  guy  He outperformed Hextall enough during the
 ' season to make Flyers management think that way too

Don't be so sure of that FLYERS management never says bad thing about
Roussel but they don't say too much on the good side either I've seen
at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was
to have two good goaltenders it was Tommy this Tommy that and oh yeah
Dom has played well too

 By the way what was the final card on Monday night  Team picture by any
 chance

FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame Kinda dull really They handed out a
team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut but it was the
same picture they sold in the programs in midseason Had names like Benning
Kasper

 And how did the Flyers choose the fans who received the shirts off our
 backs  Winning Recchi's jersey after breaking the club's single season
 point record would have been nice  But knowing your luck you would have
 won Roussel's

Mostly random seat locations some were given out by having certain
autographs on the team photos I don't like that method since I've seen
guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures surely if they
got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies

Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team  And that is
simply because there are not enough solid twoway players to go 
around  Who would you rather have as your checking centre  Doug
Gilmour or Doug Jarvis  For that matter I would take either Gretzky
or Mario as my checking centres  Do you think Gretzky could cover
Bob Gainey 

Gretzky Lemieux Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman
They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one  If they
were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive
abilities 

When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis Gainey etc you are comparing 
apples and oranges  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't 
very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of
him  Sure Lemieux is a better player but he is a different type of
player  For a team to be successful they need to have all types of
players this includes defensive forwards

When compared with other defensive forwards Bob Gainey is the greatest
defensive forward ever  He is the player who's talents best suited being
a defensive forward who completely dominated the game when he played

Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his
offensive talents and play defensively he could have been a better
defensive forward but he wasn't

Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey

 Chelios the Norris

If you asked me  days ago I'd agree with you  I now give the nod to
Raymond Bourque his play took off the same time the B's did  Chelios
gets a close second

How about Kevin Hatcher Scored roughly  goals plays  minutes a game

 dunno who wins the Vezina but I suspect not Potvin  
  
Barrasso finally gets his due in a close one over Eddie the Eagle

That's really sad when two secondrate goalies Barasso and Belfour
are the main contenders for the Vezina Call me crazy but how about
Tommy Soderstrom  five shutouts for a th place team that doesn't
really play defense It's really unfortunate that the better goalies
in the league McLean Essensa Vernon had unspectacular years BTW
if you are going to award the Norris on the basis of the last  days
why not give the Vezina to Moog He has been the best goalie over the
past month

 Coach of the year is tricky  Burns did the most with the least raw talent
 King did a good job but the Flames clearly underachieved last year Brian
 Sutter has done exceptionally well in his first year with a new team ditto
 Demers Page has been blessed by the ripening and acquisition of young
 talent Darryl Sutter is having a good year for a rookie coach Berry made
 the best of a bad situation Terry Crisp worked minor miracles and Bowman
 was Bowman  I'd pick Burns but I'm mildly biased

In your case that bias is acceptable  Mine shows with the Norris pick
so we're even

I'm impressed with what all the coaches you mentioned did but my pick would be 
Al Arbour  Not too many folks thought the Isles would be in the playoffs let 
alone contend for rd in their division Granted that they did have a little
help from their cousins on Broadway 

And I like the Islanders about as much as I like mowing my lawn

Arbour or King Burns will probably win since playoffs aren't taken
into consideration  he's OK in the regular season but I'm not sure
if he's beaten anyone other than Hartford in the playoffs

This guy owns both the NBA's Bullets and the NHL's Capitals How dumb

Meaning if they start the season with another  game unbeaten streak they

game winning streak as streaks carry over from one year to another

Hmmmm I'm not sure this is true  According to Mike Lang and good old
Stagie along with the rest of the TV crews in pittsburgh they 
winning streak could have stopped because it is a regular season mark
I would think this would also hold with an unbeaten streak for regular

  is a good stat because it is the only stat that I am aware of that
 takes into account defensive play  It isn't a measure of defensive
 play it takes into account offense and defence all aspects of play
                                                   
  If we are interested of real allround players the power play stats
  should be considered too Because the power play is also one aspect 
  of play There is still something to be done with these player evaluation
  tools
 
 IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man
 advantage  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
 because their point totals are inflated by power play points
  tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull
 John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck
 
 Given the opportunity to play power play consistently any player can
 inflate his totals

Except for Vancouver of course  Bure has a hard time scoring on that

Well the tentative rules anyway  And of course since the season is
not entirely over tentative entry form  But who cares  The real hockey
season is starting

Here's the deal  You email preferably or post your predictions AND the
number of games you think each series will go  Each round will be
weighted so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important but the
early rounds will still be important  Here is the scoring

Pick st round winner way off on games   points
Pick st round winner within one game    points
Pick st round winner pick  of games    points

Pick nd round winner way off on games   points
Pick nd round winner within one game    points
Pick nd round winner pick  of games    points

Pick conference champ way off on games   points
Pick conference champ within one game    points
Pick conference champ pick  of games    points

Pick Stanley Cup champ way off on games  points
Pick Stanley Cup champ within one game   points
Pick Stanley Cup champ pick  of games   points
Pick loser in  series goes             points
Pick loser in  series decided in Game  OT  points
these last two are sympathy points probably won't happen anyway

Obviously picking the Stanley Cup champion is important  I will do some
tests to see if the format is fair but probably I will be too lazy to
modify it so the scoring will probably be like this  As for entry forms
well this post is getting too long so see next post

Here is a review of some of the office things that have
affected the AHL this year


ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS
The St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by
problems Onice the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but
off ice was less happy A strike by public workers has forced the
leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of
the seaosn since midJan They have played home games in places
like Montreal Cornwall and Charlottetown Their playoff home
games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax NS One
demostration got violent Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and
rocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium
Despite the problems Toronto officials insist that the Leafs
will return to St John's once the strike ends

SENATORS SOLD
The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to
the Ottawa Senators NHL organization They are the only Canadian
NHL team with an American AHL affiliate and have made it clear
they intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic
Provinces This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL
head office but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting
in May The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it 
clear the league was more interested in the stability of the 
AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership rather than maintaining
the year history of the AHL in New Haven 

The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown
New Brunswick and are expected to move there

DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON
After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out
of Moncton the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind 

The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing
their minor league roster from something to around a dozen and they
wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise

Enter the Dallas Lone Stars Dallas agreed to supply the remaining
 or  players to the Moncton franchise Thus keeping the Hawks
in the New Brunswick city

The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if
the season ticket base increases to over  The Hawks only sold
 for this year

SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL
The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of
Saint John NB The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 
Exhibition Center The Flames still have to apply for an expansion
frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble

CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE
Despite rumors to the contrary the Capitals will follow the Baltimore
Skipjacks to Maine The Caps' current farm team the Baltimore Skipjacks
announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates
There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced
a limited deal with Portland They would supply a dozen or so players
including  goalies They become the third team to announce a limited
farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders

AHL GAME OF THE WEEK
In early January the AHL started a game of the week The game produced
by I believe Pyman Productions was televised across the Canadian
Maritimes and northeastern US The first few weeks saw two games of
the week one in Canada and another in the US but since then there
has been only one Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and
shown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and I believe Atlantic
Sports Network in Canada but I'm not sure about that I am not
sure if playoff games will be covered

UTICA GONE SYRACUSE ADDED
There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next
season There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern
city and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them

a limited deal with Portland They would supply a dozen or so players
including  goalies They become the third team to announce a limited

It was Bryan Trottier not Denis Potvin  It was a vicious
'boarding' from behindTrottier was given a major
 
Perhaps it was Trottier  It happened behind the Habs goal if
I recall Gainey simply didn't have his head up as he was
picking up the puck
 
But Roger what the hell does this have to do with Gainey's
skill as a hockey player  If Probert smashes Gilmour's head
into the boards next week will that diminish your assessment
of Gilmour's skills
 
If Gilmour was taken completely by surprise as Gainey was then
yeah I would have to say that Doug wasn't playing
technically smart  hockey  In any case to claim as Greg did
that Gainey never made  a technical mistake is absolutely
ludicrous
 
Later on in your posting you make reference to putting words
into other people's mouthsI would suggest that your last
paragraph can only be interpreted in one waynamely that I
along with Greg claim that Gainey never made a technical
mistake  If you actually read what I've written you will find
that I make no such claimsoooo if logic serves me well
you're contradicting yourself
 
Gainey was a plugger  And when the press runs out of things
to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype the
pluggers  Grant Fuhr Essa Tikkannen Butch Goring Bob
Nystrom Bob Gainey Doug Jarvis Derek Sanderson Wayne
Cashman Bob Baun Bob Pulford Ralph Backstrom Henri
Richard Dick Duffand so on
 
I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter
 
Good for you  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of
course but to each his own
 
Roger I'm not sure here but I think ignorance is really a
function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an
opinionbut hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all
means go aheadthat's if it makes you feel better
 
I think Gainey would be honoured to know that you've included
him
 
I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is
remembered at  all
 
 
My word such vehemence against poor ol' Bob Gainey  Why does
he bother you so muchhe was an effective player for his style
of play
 
on this list  I also think you have a relatively naive view
about what wins a hockey gamepluggers are an integral part
of
 
Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team  And that
is simply because there are not enough solid twoway players to
go  around  Who would you rather have as your checking
centre  Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis  For that matter I would
take either Gretzky or Mario as my checking centres  Do you
think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey 
 
I'm really sorry Roger but you have lost me completely here 
Why don't you ask me if I would rather have Jesus Christ
himself in nets
 
Now if you were to compare say for example Bob Gainey with Guy
Carbonneau you would have a balanced comparison
 
any team  The Selke is designed to acknowledge their
contributionI think that most people understand that it's
not the Nobel Prizeso settle down
 
You're wrong again  The Selke is awarded to the forward that
does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the
best plugger  If  Gilmour does the best defensive job in the
league I don't see why he  should be out of the running simply
because he also contributes offensively
 
I'm wrong AGAINhmmm let's seewhere was I wrong in the
first place  I'm only guessing here Rog but I have a feeling
that you've setup a You're wrong again macro key on your
machine
 
I agree that my use of the word plugger is simplisticbut I
think you know what I'm getting at  I would also like to point
out that Gilmour's potential as a Selkewinner was never part of
the debateare you asking me for an opinion  If so I think
there are far too many other deserving players to include Gilmour
among the candidates
 
Settle down  If you think that I have likened the Selke to the
Nobel prize then I suggest that you had best settle down 
And if you are going to try to put words in my mouth let me
suggest that you settle  down before you bother following up
on my postings 
 
I would suggest that your comment And when the press runs out

 Yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 
 minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the
 best defenseman in the league I'd take a whole team of Chelioses if I

has no experience and no previous exposure to Hockey that I know of The
teams in NY and LA which also have big Hispanic groups do not seem to try
to woo this group What will Miami do Could they get Spanishlanguage
tv and radio coverage
I think as do the owners that hockey will do well in Miami since there
is a lot of people from the Northeast that spend their winters in
Florida every year As for the coverage someone will have to come up
with some money for that since broadcast rights can be expensive

Well Bruins fans it's playoff time again
It looks like the B's have peaked at the right time
Getting out of the Adams is going to be a cat fight to the end
After what they did to Montreal and Quebec these teams will be out for
revenge If Neely can stay healthy and both Bourque and Moog stay sharp
we should get to see Neely finally take out two years of frustration 
on Ulf I don't fight Samuelson I don't agree with fighting in the NHL
but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good it's him

This is going to be a good series Go Bruins

To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious

MY HOCKEY EDUCATION  What the f are you talking about  I'm
not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement 
 
My word such vehemence against poor ol' Bob Gainey  Why does
he bother you so muchhe was an effective player for his
style of play
 
He was just another player  To laud him as anything more I find
bothersome  I hated the Habs  I hated Lafleur until I realized
that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to
ever  skate in my lifetime  Why would anyone talk about Gainey
 
I hate the Habs you sound like a year old  This
statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to
argue objectively about hockey  Don't give me this crap about
cogent argumentsI've yet to read something of yours that is
cogent  You consistently argue with  emotion  huge
sweeping statements
 
Frankly you have a very unconvincing style
 
I'm not defending Bob Gaineyfrankly I don't care for him all
that much  But your dismissal of him as something less than an
effective hockey player is tiresomeit has no basis in
anything  How many Calders did he win I think it was four go
ahead and refresh my memory  What about the Conn Smythe  Was
that a fluke  Yeah not the makings of a hockey superstar I
know but try to have a reason any reason to shoot him down
 
go  around  Who would you rather have as your checking
centre  Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis  For that matter I would
take either Gretzky or Mario as my checking centres  Do you
think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey
 
I'm really sorry Roger but you have lost me completely here

up  As I said previously it is not my responsibility to

Hey cowboy  You're the expert who introduced the idiotic
comparison of Gainey with Gretzky and Lemieuxyou figure it

Sure  Two journeymen  Big deal  Neither one of them is worth

How many individual awards between them EightI don't remember

OH MY GOD  Did I say that  Rogerwhat's your point  Fuhr
is a goaltender goaltender's don't plugin his prime he was

you may as well include half the Flyers team of the same era

hype the pluggers  Grant Fuhr Essa Tikkannen Butch Goring

Tarasov claimed that Gainey was a hockey god  And Greg ate

know  that then why are you responding
 
You seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into
your sweeping vacuous statementthat's why  If you want to
debate Gainey go aheadbut why bring up everybody else  How
does it support your argument  Do you have an argument or do
you just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us
 
 
And as for blanket disregard for these individuals I can
remember  Leaf teams purely populated by such individuals

Great  I couldn't agree more  The Flyers won two cups for the
same reasonsdeservedly so  So what  I don't get it  Are you
angry that the Leafs didn't get more recognition  
 
You seem to think these pluggers are hypedI don't
agreeplain and simple  If you're last statement is some sort
of compromise fair enough

When was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city

Well actually now that you mention it a few weeks ago the CBC ran a
documentary on Ice Hockey in Harlem  the Canadian Club of New York
something like that sponsors a league for kids in Harlem and based on
the TV report they all seemed to be having a lot of fun  All playing
with regular equipment jerseys etc etc on a proper outdoor rink  It
looked just like kids playing hockey anywhere else

Some of the kids were even fortunate to get a trip to a hockey camp in Alberta

Jagr has a higher  but Francis has had more points  And take it from

Unless the Hawks can somehow change fate you're right  

Who knows though  Maybe some intensive forechecking aka normal Hawks
style will nullify a seemingly unbeatable team  Maybe the Pens are due
for a letdown  Hell how could they possibly extend their record
making play all the way through the playoffs

Let's be honest  The Pens may not 'loose' one game as you
put it but they will definitely lose one game  Remember
the regular season doesn't mean much when it comes to 
playoff time  The Caps have a shot at least  the Flyers
sure don't

Doesn't it also have the Statue of Liberty on it or is that Richter's Mask

The back actually has a Bee followed by a Z to represent the Beezer It

 Actually Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two

 Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team although in a late
 stage of the tournament Technically I seem to recall that you can leave
 spots open until  hrs before the WC final

HmmmI also heard through the grapevine that Team Finland might try and
leave a spot open for at least one NHLer Some guy named Selnne ever

Selanne's  leads the Jets Teppo Numminen is   Who do you think
is better defensively  Ron Francis of the Penguins is  although he
has  points while Jaromir Jagr has only  points but is   Is
Jagr really better on defense than Francis  And how exactly should we
interpret the fact that Mario Lemieux has by far the highest  in
the league  Does he get the Selke as well as the Ross

The plusminus does not measure defense alone  It attempts to measure
a  player's  total contribution to the team effort  And certainly it
is far from perfect and my posting never implied otherwise  All  that
my  posting  suggested  was  that  the  was a better indicator of a
player's effectiveness when examined in the context of that  player's
team's  performance than mere scoring totals alone  And as for Mario
getting the Selke  why not  After Doug Gilmour I would rather  have
Lemieux  on the ice in any situation other than as an enforcer obvi
ously than any player in the game  I used to call the Selke the Bob
Gainey  Award   It  came  about as a result of the statement made by
Anatoli Tarasov Bob Gainey is the best hockey player in the  world
I am sure that Tarasov was either misquoted originally or had a tiny
bit too much Vodka and was toying with a reporter  In any event  the
NHL  decided  to honour one dimensional checkers along with one dimen
sional scorers  Maybe the league should start awarding the Doug Gil
mour Award anually  to the league's most effective allround player

Subject SHARKS REVIEW Part  Goaltenders
MessageID AprCSDNewsHostStanfordEDU
Sender newsCSDNewsHostStanfordEDU
Organization Computer Science Department Stanford University
Date Fri  Apr   GMT

As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight I will start a series of posts
trying to revisit the players the trades the moves etc that went through
for the Sharks for the past season  If you are uninterested since I will
have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings you can
kill them

I will first try to evaluate how the players did  These ratings of course
are subject to my own biases but I hope that I can try to be as objective as
possible  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks
andor did not play for another NHL team this season

Thus then let's go to the goaltenders

	BRIAN HAYWARD		Season	th
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		P D

It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end a career that
featured sharing three Jennings Trophies with Patrick Roy in ' ' and
'  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing
grade and skip the letter grading but he had simply been awful on ice this
year save for a bright spot or two and even if he had been healthy he would
not be any more than the rdstring goalie

But Hayward was a classy individual who also figured in on the Sharks' first
ever victory the rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames
As he retires the fans will remember what a good guy he was

	JEFF HACKETT		Season rd
Acquired	' from N Y Islanders in expansion draft
Grade		C

Hackett after deservedly winning the team MVP honors last season simply
wasted the year  Other than a few good spots  saves against Los Angeles
almostshutout against Tampa Bay etc Hackett finishing with  save
percentage and a  GAA watched his status go from the team's  goalie to
bench decoration at the end of the season  He was expected early to carry
the team along instead he apparently became frustrated but the an early
injury that forced him to miss  games may have been a contributing factor
but upon return he simply wasn't up to the task  He may not return next
year

	WADE FLAHERTY		Season st still eligible as rookie
Acquired	' signed as undrafted free agent
Grade		I A

It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone thus the
incomplete grade but yet in the one start that he did get against the Calgary
Flames Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods  He started
the season poorly in Kansas City but finished strong prompting the Blades'
owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP
honors  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he
tries to make it into the NHL last year he was a capable backup for Arturs
Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs picking up
allstar honors along with Irbe now it's time for him to show that he can
share the job with Irbe next year because with prospects Dan Ryder Trevor
Robins and Scott Cashman coming along if he doesn't make it next year he
may not ever

	ARTURS IRBE		Season	st
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		B

I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that
he's a bona fide NHL goaltender perhaps a bona fide  goaltender  He has
provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had getting
the team's first ever shutout against the Los Angeles Kings on December 
He has been fearless in and out of the net aggressively playing the puck and
making passes reminding people of a young Ron Hextall except of course the
goonism  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency which is hard to do
with such a bad defense in front of him but if the Sharks are to challenge for
a playoff spot next season Irbe's the key as he demonstrated in being named
as a star of the game  times in  starts


GO CALGARY FLAMES  Al MacInnis for Norris  Gary Roberts for Hart and Smythe
GO EDMONTON OILERS  Go for playoffs next year  Stay in Edmonton

As far as I know Dusseldorf has only one CanadianGerman forward ie a  player
who was born in Canada but now has a German passport 
Benoit Doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play 
for Germany in the WC

The other Canadaborn forwards are

At the moment there are only three Germanborn forwards coming into my mind

Good for you  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of

Roger I'm not sure here but I think ignorance is really a
function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an
opinionbut hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all
means go aheadthat's if it makes you feel better

To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious  Your
hockey education is not my responsibility
 
Just curious Roger but since you have such a vast knowledge of the
game and the league how come you haven't made a living out of it
There must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field I'm sure
you'd be of great help to say the Leafs as an assistant coach or
a scout Or maybe try a career as a reporter or tv commentator
 
I might be wrong of course and you already have

 Sweden opened the scoring as Markus Naslund made a drop pass at the Finnish
 blue line Popovic picked it up and advanced towards the Finnish goal and
 shot a nice hard wrist shot in Ketterer's top corner Ville Siren's slap
 shot from the blue line on power play made it  and Juha Riihijarvi
 scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal
 put the puck high over Aslin  after the first period
 The Finns started the second period with really good pressure Korpisalo
 made it  with another goal from close range high over Aslin Then
 during the Finnish pressure Sweden turned the game around in 
 Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal and passed the puck to
 Jan Larsson in front who backhanded the puck low  Rundqvist entered
 the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund and the Finnish defense let Ahlund 
 skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal 
 Next Roger Hansson behind the goal sent the puck back to the blue line
 where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since
 there was traffic in front 
 Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan the Shadow Nilsson Stefan
 and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone Patrik passed the puck back to
 Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake 
 Then Keijo Sailynoja show started He reduce and equalized the lead in only
  seconds First he scored the  goal and after that he came in alone 
 with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot Sailynoja
 made a nice penalty shot showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot
 The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the  goal
 late in the game on a nice power play combination Renberg waited in the slot
 showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side Ahlund passed the puck
 and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side
 But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only  seconds later scored the
 game's final goal to make it  Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow
 angle that maybe Aslin should have saved

 All in all a decent game where the defense wasn't the best
 Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period
 to try no combinations

 Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team Larsson
 NilssonJuhlin best line overall again it seems to be a working WC line
 Stillman good on defense
 Some players aren't good enough for the WC though Hakan Ahlund faell ner
 hjaelmen och jobba Roger Hansson Challe Berglund Kenny Jonsson
 will likely have to leave for NHL pros

 Twogoal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the
 Finnish team Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game we've seen him
 a lot better so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC
 I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team It would be inter
 resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC

    Now what if the two teams were merged this has been proposed in Tampere 
 with Ilves  Lynx and Tappara  Axe  The fans wouldn't take it 
 They rather see their teams out of the playoffs most of the time or even 
 relegated than merged  It's not that difficult to understand it's just 
 like here in Helsinki  You grow up being either a Jokerit or HIFK fan
 The other team is the last team in the world you would support  I'm not 
 talking about 'hate' but about extremely deeply rooted rivalry

Deeply rooted rivalry Ahem Jokerit have been around since  and joined
the top flight only in the early 's Helsingfors IFK have been around since
 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the s so I think
you're exagerating here

    However it's been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team
  that's the Finnish national team  Maybe that's how you could set up a 
 huge franchise in Finland  No one has ever said that the team must be 
 called after one city or play all its games on one arena  Just one Team 
 Finland and Team Sweden in the NHL just wouldn't make any sense  we have 
 way more talent than th of the total of North American talent  After a 
 couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the 
 Nordic  presuming that our teams would have the advantage in  drafting 
 local talent as prooposed

That's a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the Canadian 
American Olympic teams have been    and they've had to play according to our
set of rules and on international ice The  Olympic teams contained about
as much talent as your average expansion team Canada had Eric Lindros Sean
Burke Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos Another four or five have been deep subs in
the NHL As for the Yanks Keith Tkachuk Scott Lachance Bret Hedican Shawn 
McEachern Steve Heintze Ted Donato Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 
rdth line players in the NHL while Robb Stauber has done well for the 
Kings in goal Nothing more In fact I'm sure that an AllStar team assembled
from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford 
or Tampa Bay currently are doing

But what happens if all topclass Finnish  Swedish players gradually end up
with Helsinki  Stockholm as the North Americanbased ones gradually retire and
no CanadianAmerican team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia 
Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHLbased players

superstar
star

DJyrki Lumme

This would be interesting Clearly Finland's top five players Winnipeg's
Selanne  Numminen Vancouver's Lumme Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's
Tikkanen are right up there with any fiveman unit Pittsburgh  co have But
I have my doubts about the homebased Finnish players  the national team did
well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of
Markus Ketterer the goalie  or the players listed above and luck There's
presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at
the highest level but still valuable role players however My guess would be
that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a  team in the NHL

Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America
Their points total  players is   seven more than Ottawa's  top
players combined If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in 
Sweden an allSwedish team would assemble about  skill points
Deducting some points from Pittsburgh NY Rangers and other teams that rely on
Swedish players the Swedish team would finish in sixth place  about as high
as Boston Vancouver Calgary and Montreal on paper So the dynasty talk
isn't completely unfounded here An allFinnishallSwedish team might have an
advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time
won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably
play the wideopen European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the
North American checking game However if free agency becomes a factor the top 
Scandinavian players still might end up playing for largemarket teams after a 
couple of years the same way Edmonton's dynasty crumbled in the late 's 
Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an 
exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all I'd settle for a 
compromise prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during 
the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players After this 
the amateur draft should be open to anyone

A fine  year history came to a close tonight as the Minnesota North Stars 
or Norm's Stars whichever you prefer lost to the Red Wings by a score of
  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen who netted
two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to
play

Tonight on the air on the Stars TV telecast announcer Al Shaver the voice
of the North Stars stated basically that he will not follow the team to 
Dallas  Shaver when asked by his son who was doing the broadcast with him
What will you do now responded First I'm going to get me a new pair of
slippers  Then I'm going to sit in my easy chair and watch the world go by

Thank you North Stars and thank you Al Shaver for  years of Minnesota
memories

I saw yesterday on TV a game between Team Sweden and Team Finland
Most of us might know that it was played in Stockholm and the result
was  for the home team That's nothing very special But I was
very surprised of Saku Koivu I must admit that he surprised me 
already in the Finnish playoffs And now on team Finland

Saku Koivu is a light weight player if we consider his size According
to my stats he is only cm and kgs And he is only  
But he is a real twoway player Skates well can score gives nice
passes does even bodycheckings He is really something to watch
in the WC 

The size isn't always everything Maybe we remember Harlamov
And they say that Saku is still growing up cm during last year

Saku isn't that small any longer I guess I heard he is cm tall at the
moment and will still grow cm

Not too low perhaps but surely not as high as that of an European NHL
division The Finnish team for example would contain all players currently 
 on
the national team plus a topclass foreigner or two They would be in an
entirely different league than TPS or Jokerit both of whom have perhaps a
dozen players of international class  if even that Why settle for a minor
league when you could have the best

How many players of international class an average NHL team has 
Top players just play more in smaller rinks Is the quality of European hockey
really poor then recent years only few northamerican usually good farm 
players players have got place in Finnish league or Elitserien while most 
have been shipped back

KDKA has first rights to Pirates games and will split probably

The new name is Florida Panthers  
The panther is an endangered species mostly located in the Everglades
A couple of years ago there were license plates made with Panthers on
them part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund

The name of the new President of the Panthers should be announced today

As of yesterday's paper Huizenga's new hockey team will take the ice at
the Miami Arena this fall  The team has a guaranteed twoyear lease with
the arena with four oneyear options that could run through 

It's not our choice James Blosser a lawyer and Huizenga Aid said
about ruling out the arena as a long term option  The NHL told us we 
can't stay there  It's not economically feasible

One reason is because the Miami Heat basketball team controls skybox
and advertising revenue at the arena reducing the hockey team's profit
potential

The hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward Dade 
and Palm Beach counties

A leading site is vacant land near Joe Robbie Stadium where residents
 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena ending
an eightyear battle of wills

As I promised I would give you the name of the Panther's president
After Huizenga announced the team name he announced that Bill
Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers

A little Bio from SunSentinel
Torrey the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as 
persident and general manager of the New York Islanders
Throughout his  years in the NHL Bill Torrey's bow ties have become
as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair

The Panthers will introduce a uniform insignia and ticketprice 
information in early next month  In the meantime Huizenga leaves the
daytoday operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke the VP and
GM

The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team
to focus attention on an endangered species  There are  to  Florida
Panthers in the Everglades National Park the Big Cypress National 
Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida

The Panther is the quickeststriking of all cats Torrey said  
Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice

More BIO
In Torrey Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders
in  and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four
consecutive Stanley Cup championships their first after only eight
seasons and  consecutive winning seasons  As executive vice president
of the California Golden Seals Torrey watched the Seals go to the play
offs in  only their second NHL season

I guess this completes my own personal hat trick said Torrey  a
native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm
Beach

According to this morning's PostGazette

The Pens will be carried by KDKARadio am unless the Pirates
are playing  When the Pirates play the games will be carried by 
WDVE fm  WDVE will carry  games starting with tonight's
game

In fact after this season KDKA will no longer be the flagship
station for the Pens  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new 
deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games  It seems
more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next 
season  KBL will carry  games on tv  with  of the games to be 
simulcast on KDKATV  The remaining  games as well as some of the 
early round playoff games will be available by subscription tv only
To receive the games you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee and
then a monthly fee of  dollars

Also under the new deal there will no longer be radiotv 
simulcasts  There will be a TV broadcast team and a radio
broadcast team  

No word on who the announcers will be  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald
are both under contract with KDKA but their contracts expire at the
end of this season  KBL President Bill Craig said he'd like to hire
Lange and Steigerwald

And of course Mike Ramsey was at one time the captain in Buffalo prior to

  It was nice to see ESPN show game  between the Wings and Leafs since
 the Cubs and Astros got rained out Instead of showing another baseball
 game they decided on the Stanley Cup Playoffs A classy move by ESPN

What did you leave the room each of the  or so times they said that
there WERE NO OTHER NIGHT BASEBALL GAMES Every break they took back at
the studio mentioned it followed by 'sowe're gonna show you hockey
instead' My wife and I are hoping for rain at every baseball game they
have a feed for tommorrow night

Point is be glad they showed hockey but if baseball was available
anywhere else you can bet you would've watched baseball last night

Detroit April 

In a development that shocked most knowledgable observers the Detroit Redwings
scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en
route to a  win over the best team in the NHL the Toronto Maple Leafs 

The Leafs could not be faulted as they completely dominated the inferior
Detroit squad and clearly deserved to win Only the biased officiating of
Andy Van Hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on
the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior 
visiting side prevented an allout massacre of the Wings by the league's best 
team 

       							    Alan

PS This is sweet Roger So sweet I look forward to the next installment on
Wednesday night I trust you do too

 Al Micheals out of this He annoys me 

 I was skeptical before the game but was pleasantly surprised at the
 coverage  I was particularly impressed by the close range camera coverage
 of work in the corners and behind the play without losing a beat getting
 back to the puck

   Boy  everyone has been ripping on ESPN's hockey coverage or is it just
Pittsburgher's who are thrilled with Lange  Steigy  For all of you
who are unaware  ESPN bought the air time from ABC and did all the 
production advertising sales commentating etc  and even

However that aside the real question is whether you like the idea of
changing the names based on the reasons given for it making it easier for
the 'casual fan' or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names
based on individuals who do deserve the honour  IMO the latter is a nice
and unique touch that differs from other sports  In addition I do not
think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of
people that are interested in hockey so it's a pointless exercise anyway

There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the
fans  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
more than names honouring personages  And of course they would not appear
nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time  
Another thing that bothers me is the points system  Percentages as used in
the other major sports are clearly more informative  When I look at the
NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to
account for games in hand which is almost always the case  Some will
object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an Americanization
of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and
whether it is American or not is irrelevant
 
If the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not 
central to the original article  Something to consider additionally is
whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'
would have been able to do so without an organized professional league to
play in  In this case honouring builders of the league as opposed to
builders of the sport becomes a chickenandegg type question although
it was the chicken

Even if Orr couldn't have contributed without the likes of Norris you would
have to agree that Norris couldn't have contributed without the likes of Orr
And taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made
the more meaningful contribution

Exactly true  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch
is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame  I have
always thought that this was nonsense

Dunno if the Stein comparison is justifiable since it doesn't look as though
his 'unanimous acceptance' to the Hall will hold up

It doesn't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it

No

In what still IMHO ranks as the alltime greatest PR blunder not to
mention onice blunder the Whalers ever committed GM Eddie Johnston and
Coach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
him of the Captain's C in December of  The whole organization read
EJ and Ley and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of
a dupe to know how much he was being blindsided by EJ dumped on Francis all
season starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract publicly 
humiliating him stripping him of the C and then trading him that Spring
to the Penguins Classy guy that EJ

The loss of Francis and too a lesser extent Ulf was one of a series of
decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fanawareness
from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today

Gratuitous good EJ notehe did preside over the organization when it
acquired Verbeek Cassels Sanderson Poulin Nylander etc He stripped the
roster but he DID lay a foundation

And now I interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you 
another message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics

I passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through
a filter to average out games goals assists points and penalty minutes
for the mythical average NHL pro who played in the league this season Why
Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code

Anyway after I wiped out the odd goalies in the list I came up with

NHL average		 GP       G       A       Pts       PIM

Then I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who
had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories

Marty McInnis NYI	 GP   G   A   Pts   PIM 
Igor Kravchuk EDM	 GP   G   A   Pts   PIM 

These two are close in games goals assists and points but are too far off
in PIM This leaves as the most average player in the NHL

Bobby Carpenter WAS	 GP   G   A   Pts   PIM 

What an honor

I also passed the list through with the goalies still included Kravchuk and
Carpenter were still in the top three but Rob DiMaio came flying up from 
behind to take the title

NHL average		 GP       G       A       Pts       PIM
Igor Kravchuk EDM      GP   G   A   Pts   PIM 
Bobby Carpenter WAS    GP   G   A   Pts   PIM 
Rob DiMaio TB		 GP   G   A   Pts   PIM 


It's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it

 After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that
 Milwaukee should have an NHL team I thought I'd pass along a story I heard
 recently  This is second hand so I don't know how true it is but I have
 no reason to doubt it either
 
 Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge
 hockey team  The owner of the Admirals sorry I can't remember his name
 either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
 Bradley Center

Lloyd Pettit

 
 Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise but 
 turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of  million was too
 high
 
 Like I said I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if
 it's true don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon  The Admirals
 aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club
 and a minor league club in the same building especially since the NBA's
 Milwaukee Bucks play there as well

Yes it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for M but
at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much 
less than that He felt that no one would pay M for an expansion team and
that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that But
the market fooled him and  teams have been created for M apiece in the
last three years and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than 
M and I doubt that he could get one for that little

Pettit gambled and lost Now he'll have to pay more

 Podein is an interesting casebecause he was eligible to
 play in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev Zubov
 and Anderssonobviously Sather and Pocklington are not
 the total scrooges everyone makes them out to becertainly
 in this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the
 New York Rangers

What is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus WC
I know that the Rangers are holding back Kovalev Zubov and Andersson for
Binghamton but I also know that the Whalers wanted Michael Nylander to play
for Springfield while Nylander wanted to play for Sweden The Whalers allowed
the NHL to decide and the NHL chose the WCs How does this differ from the
Rangers and Oilers Did the Whalers have to go through the league or could
they have forced Nylander to play in Springfield

I think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he
got traded to the Leafs Also wasn't Rick Vaive the captain of
the Leafs when he got traded to Chicago with Steve Thomas for
Ed Olcyzk and someone Speaking of the Leafs I believe that
Darryl Sittler was their captain he'd torn the C off his
jersey but I think he reclaimed the captaincy later on when he
was traded to the Flyers

Oh yeah of course Gretzky was the captain of the Oilers before
he was traded wasn't he

The San Francisco Bay area media is reporting tonight that the Detroit
Red Wings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs   Can someone who is not
part of the media conspiracy against the Leafs tell me how the game
really went I am expecting a  win for the Leafs shutout for
Potvin hat trick for Andreychuk and a goal and  assists for
Gilmour  If the Leafs really lost how many penalties did whichever
biased ref was at the game have to call against the Leafs to let the
Red Wings win

Thank you very much

Roland Dreier                                        dreiermathberkeleyedu


Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the victoryeasily

I watched most of the game on ESPN as soon as I realized that they
were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second
The Maple Leafs were flat  Very flat  Meanwhile the Red Wings were
skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game  I didn't
detect any bad penalty calls Van Hellemond did his usual good job
Toronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff
game in a few years  nervous

For the Leafs sake I hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies
for game   If game  is indicative of the series it's gonna go
quick

Does anyone have the games ESPN will be airing this week  Hopefully the
DetroitToronto game tongiht  I though ABC did a decent job by getting some

Fking NO hockey games televised nationally tonight  What the hell is
this  Why the hell is ESPN showing some stupid baseball game when
baseball is not even three weeks into the season and hockey is in the
playoffs  No wait I know the answer   But still  It really
pisses me off to no end  They better start putting some more fcking
games on or they will never make any money off of the deal that brought
hockey back to ESPN  AARGH  not that I'd watch anyway but hockey
needs all the publicity it can get

You obviously don't understand how TV scheduling works  ESPN had
prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had
contracted all the other bs shows well in advance  The NHL TV deal
was very late in the scheduling process you normally have to do this
oneplus year out  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the
season started  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by
squeezing in extra telecasts when it could like the last Minnesota
game and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball
telecasts which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last
night

But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will  They
must honor the previous deals they made   does have something
to do with it especially if you risk a  lawsuit for breach of
contract with baseball

So relax  I'm happy  I don't get SportsChannel anyway

Us easterners who have newspapers with editors
unsympathetic to playoff pools often don't get
summaries from west coast games since they
finish too late at night for the morning edition

I and I'm sure others too would greatly appreciate
it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games
could be posted to this group right away
basically all we need are goal scorers and assists
don't bother with times penalties shots etc

this would make a lot of poolobsessed people very
happy

I guess with the Senators out golfing now the 
local papers have lost interest  

thanks

 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports

Kings   Calgary Flames   

The third place Kings opened the  Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary against
the second place Flames and came out with an impressive  victory in front of
a nonsellout crowd of  at the Saddledome in Calgary

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the
opening period though the Kings scored off the opening faceoff  The Kings got
into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out
standing team defense  It took the Flames  of the first period to record
their first shot on goal  The Kings ranked th of the  playoff teams on
penalty killing shut down the Flames  The Flames went  on the power play 
and could record only  shot on goal in those  opportunities  The Kings had
their problems on the power play yet they did manager to score  goals in 
tries

The Kings forwards backchecked while the defense stood the Flames up at the
blue line allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the 
Flames  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex
pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse
in his right leg  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to 
the dressing room for the rest of the game  Interviewed on the radio this 
morning he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday

st period 
 The Kings got things started right off the opening faceoff  Gretzky won
the draw with the puck going to Sydor  He crossed center ice and slapped the
puck into the Flames zone and behind the net  The puck carried around to the
far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom He
put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up  Gretzky set up
in 'his office' moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where
Sydor had moved in  Sydor who got the puck between the faceoff dot and the 
hash mark shot off the pass beating Vernon low and between the legs

Millen and Fleury went off at   Skrudland went off at  but the Kings
failed to convert  Carson went off at  and the Flames failed to convert
Dahlquist went off at  and Dahl went off at  giving the Kings a 
second on which they failed to convert  The Kings recorded  goal posts in
the period

nd period 
The Kings opened with a on carried over from the st period which they failed
to convert on  With  seconds left in the on Vernon put a bouncing puck into
the stands and received a delay of game

 Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play  Kurri with the
puck in the neutral zone tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit 
the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line  Suter skated 
down the near wing and into the Kings zone  He faked a shot at the circle and
skated around Kurri As he cut thorugh the crease he got Hrudey to go with him 
and he put the puck behind Hrudey on his stick side for a short hander

 The Kings reclaimed the lead  seconds later on the same power play
Shuchuk in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed
for the net  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot 
where  Kings Shuchuk and Granato were being checked by  Flames  Carson
came from the far corner picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot
between the legs of Vernon from  feet above the crease

 The Kings widened their lead just  seconds later  Rychel was checked off
the puck at the Flames blue line  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass
cross the slot to Huddy  Huddy shot off the pass from the near faceoff dot
beating a diving Vernon on the glove side

  later the Kings had a  goal lead  McSorley took a shot form the
near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards  Marty got his
own rebound skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low
slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon

Skrudland went off at  but the Kings could not convert  Sydor went off at
 and Watters went off at  giving the Flames a  second  but they
failed to convert  McSorley went off at  and the Flames had  consecutive
power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high
sticking at   Sandstrom went off at  to close out the period  The
Kings hit  goal post in the period

rd period
The Kings used the phrase Initiate not retaliate and it was very evident here
in the rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames 
continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game

 The Kings extended their lead to  goals at the  mark  The Kings shot
the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone  Vernon went behind the net to
cut off the puck but he could not control it  Donnelly who was behind him
wacked at the puck sending it into the low slot  As Vernon slid back in to the
crease Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net
where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon

Sydor went off at  Nieuwendyk went off at  as the teams skated  on 

 Otto skating down the far side stepped around McSorley cut to the net
and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot  Dahlquist cut through the top of the 
crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey

Carson and Rychel came in on a   When Carson passed across to Rychel Fleury
tripped Rychel with no call  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where 
Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards drawing 
a minute major and a game misconduct at the  mark  Unfortunately the 
Kings squandered the  minute power play when Granato at  and Watters at 
 took penalties  

 The Flames closed to within  at the  mark  MacInnis at the near 
point passed to Yawney at the far point  He took a few strides towards the
net wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of
Hrudey  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost  Timeout  LA

 MacInnis took a penalty at  and the Kings converted on the power play
to seal the victory  Sandstrom skating down the far wing in the Flames zone 
cut towards the back of the net  Just as he crossed the goal line he passed 
the puck into the low slot on the far side to Carson who shot off the pass 
beating Vernon on the ice stick side

At the  mark Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he
went after Shuchuk  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing a single
minor for cross checking and a  minute misconduct and he took the Flames
right out of the game

On the plus side  The Kings for the most part played very disciplined hockey
as they let Calgary retaliate  The Kings played good team defense and excellent
penalty killing

On the minus side  The Kings lost almost every faceoff  This must improve or
the Flames will surely get that power play back on track

Notes

The Kings recalled Guy Leveque Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix

Wayne Gretzkys st period assist was his th career playoff point

The Kings entered the game th in the league in shots per game against giving
the opposing team an average of  shots per game

Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a  record in afternoon 
games  The Flames entered the game with a  success rate on the power play
over their last  games

The teams were  against each other in the regular season

are predicting  Although I think Bryan Murray is probably the best GM
I have ever seen in hockey
 
How do you figure that  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were
a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked
unlikely to win it  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it  A truly great GM would
have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup  A good GM like Murray can

I think Murray has done a great job  He's picked up Ciccarelli
Sheppard Ysebaert Howe Coffey and Riendeau plus some depth players 
without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects
All of this in three years  Has anyone done better

The year before he took over the Wings didn't even make the playoffs
There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings
did OK but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch
and grab style  They didn't have much talent

Gerald Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau although I'm not
ready to admit that's a horrible pick  They hired him after the
draft which has never made sense to me  His first pick was
Lapointe

Ron 


And one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set
of things to worry about  I'm getting bored reading the same problems
in the paper decade after decade  I want people to have to deal
with new problems

I also think that they will have a hard time with Pittsburgh if they
face them in the finals which is what all the Detroit sportswriters 
are predicting  Although I think Bryan Murray is probably the best GM
I have ever seen in hockey I'm not as impressed with his abilities as
a bench coach or in general as a motivator  With the amount of talent he
has on this team he should have blown away everyone in the Norris  There
is not another team in the Norris maybe even in the Campbell conference
that can hold a candle to Detroit on paper in terms of pure talent  But
some guys have not been pulling their weight at times this year  Scotty
Bowman on the other hand who has won I think correct me if I'm wrong
nine  stanley cups is an outstanding coach and I think he could
outcoach Murray if they faced each other  


Bryan Murray has done very little as GMYzerman Fedorov Cheveldae
Chaisson the whole Russian strategy was a product of the previous
GMMurray has made a couple of decent tradesthat's about it
that would hardly rank him as the best GM

Wasn't Primeau Murray's first decision as GM

It looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European

Ranford Tugnutt Benning Manson Smith Buchberger and Corson
are playing for Canada

Podein and Weight are playing for the US

Is Kravchuk playing for the RussiansI know he had nagging
injuries late in the season

Podein is an interesting casebecause he was eligible to
play in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev Zubov
and Anderssonobviously Sather and Pocklington are not
the total scrooges everyone makes them out to becertainly
in this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the
New York Rangers

I think that Jack Ferreira's firing eventually led to Kingston's
firing  You mention consistency of vision  I think the
Sharks lost that with the loss of Ferreira  There has never
been a  headed GM that has ever worked  You need one
person making the personnel decisions at the top not
management by committee  The conventional wisdom
from around the league is that Ferreira would have
made the moves that would have fielded a better product
on the ice

How exactly would Ferreira accomplished this  The threeheaded GMship has
taken a lot of heat but nobody's explained how things would have been any
different had Ferreira still been there  Would Ferreira have made more
trades  Who would have he had traded  Would he have made fewer trades
Who should not have been traded

When Jacques Demers brought the Wings to the conference finals twice a
few years back he had everyone on the team giving  percent but he 
had very little talent  He had Yzerman Bob Probert who had drinking
problems at the time and a couple of decent goaltenders in Hanlon and
Stefan who got hot  That's about it  Can you name one player on those
earlier teams who even deserved to be in the allstar game much less 
actually got there other than Yzerman and Probert  Like Petr Klima
Give me a break  When they faced Edmonton in both of those conference
finals as hard as they played it was clear they faced a team that simply
had superior talent to the Wings  That's why they could not get to the
finals  Also at that time the Norris division was still the weakest 
division in hockey and getting past Chicago and Toronto was not as
impressive as it is today

Murray has brought scoring talent to the Wings that they did not have a
few years ago when Devellano was GM and Demers was coach  To name a few
Ysebaert Kozlov and Paul Coffey who has made a definite positive impact on
the power play especially  

Murray has built one of the most talented teams in hockey at the present with
the possible exception of the Pittsburgh Penguins  The Wings have at least
five  goal scorers that I can think of and a couple of defenseman with over
 games worth of playoff experience  Murray's one failing is that unlike
the other GM's you mentioned who are definitely also good don't get me
wrong he has not found for himself a strong coach to motivate the team to
go out and give  percent for the full  minutes every night like they 
did the last time they made a cup run  When a team wins or loses it's a
reflection of the GM and the coach which was the point of my original 
post  If the team outmatches their opponent in terms of talent but loses
anyway which has been the case this year when the Wings have struggled
that indicates that the GM has done his job in building up the team but the
coach has failed to motivate them  If as in the case of the last run the
Wings made in the playoffs before Murray came they gave opponents a hard
time who should have beaten them easily that indicates good coaching making
up for a lack of talent

All of this is fine  I never said that Murray was a bad GM  I merely said
that he isn't the best GM in hockey or even a contender for that honor
If Murray is as great as you claim the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup
by now probably more than once  If he was as great a GM as you claim
and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent
enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success
But Murray is an average unspectacular NHL coach and a pretty good GM
so none of this is true anyway

Is there an award for best backup behind a hockey great
Underneath all the hype about Lemieux Stevens Jagr Ulf
etc Ron Francis has quietly put together a  point season
 goals and  assists in  games  That was probably the
best acquisition the Penguins have made since getting Lemieux
apologies to Rick Tocchet who has had a hell of a year
himself  The Pens got just the right person at just the right
time when they got Francis before the playoffs two years ago to
backup Mario  Who was the secondline center before they got
Francis  I remember Randy Gilhen who really plays tough an
ace in the faceoff circle but nobody with all the skills
Francis has scoring passing winning faceoffs and putting
 into every game every night  Just wanted to glow a
little

I know what you mean  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice
In fact one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person
is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably
be seeing on tv  He does so many subtle things behind the play

He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad
stressed the importance of playing twoway hockey that you have to
learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took
that advice to heart  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived
in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards for the most part couldn't
and wouldn't play a lick of defense

It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought
all of this success to the Pens  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has
certainly helped and even ol' Kjell has been steady  But looking at
this team you could almost take any one of them out of the lineup
permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it
wouldn't matter

If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would
be  Tom Barrasso  Ron Francis  Larry Murphy  I'd love to put
Francis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage
the Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso

On Apr in Don Cherry  Coach's Corner
user Allan SullivancsUAlber writes
Next a clip was shown from an earlier episode in which Don was
proclaiming Doug Gilmour to be the best player not only in
the NHL but in the world What about players like Lemieux
Don said that Gilmour was the best PLAYER not Designated point getter
Its not like baseball where you have a designatted hitter who
can score runs but can't play defense Gilmour is a good two way player

This clip was shown on local news in Pittsburgh last night KDKA complete
with animated sarcasm by the sportscaster  It's the second time Cherry
has been shown on local Pittsburgh news in the last couple of weeks  Both
times he was blasting Lemieux

What can you expect from a buffoon who said that the Pens should have
drafted Kirk Muller instead of Mario Lemieux  

Perhaps once upon a time Don Cherry had some insight into the game of
hockey but he's really degenerated into a parody of himself

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the NHL
He called a total of  penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques
The Nords' penalty came in OT  Stewart being an exNordique himself
was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murderWE WAS ROBBED

No  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost and Ron Hextall is the
reason Quebec won  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending that
goaltending was the key etc etc  Well the key doesn't quite fit if you're
Montreal  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call but let's face it
he literally left his feet to throw an elbow  Blaming Stewart is just an
excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst
goals he could possibly allow  He even saw the whole shot dammit  Besides
Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT

Montreal played a solid game although they still don't know how to clear
traffic in front of the net the loss of Schneider will hurt even more 
Normally I would say that any team that blows a goal lead with less than 
five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME 
ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads  But I don't
think this was a team loss although Keane should have been able to clear 
the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal  Roy is paid big money to 
play  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot

Demers should start Racicot in the next game  If not that he should let
the damn team read the papers for the next day or twoand maybe this
article if possible

Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal He was shaky and
on his knees for the rest of the night  The winning goal shouldn't have
gone in

I didn't think the wraparound was as bad as the second goal  I also didn't
think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender can't remember who
in the first place  But you are correct it shouldn't have gone in
regardless

Oh well at least the Bruins lost in OT also Ha Ha

Yep  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second
IMO  How about Neely though   Holy shit what a player

Speaking of great players manohman can Quebec skate  I haven't seen a
team so potent on the rush in a long time  Watching them break out of their
zone especially Sundin is a treat to watch  They remind me of the Red 
Army  

But I still hate the team

On the rest of the games  Didn't St Louis' winning goal come on a
powerplay  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly especially against Detroit 
Same goes for Calgary very very undisciplined  When Marty McSorely is
waving guys to the bench to avoid fights you know something's up  New
Jersey was overmatched Terreri's heroics notwithstanding  Mario is
unbelievable and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs  But I 
hate that team anyway

Ok here's the solution to your problem  Move to Canada  Yesterday I was able
to watch FOUR gamesthe NJPITT at  on ABC LACAL at  CBC 
BUFFBOS at  TSN and FOX and MONQUE at  CBC  I think that if
each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for some odd
consecutive nights I haven't counted so that's a pure guess

I have two tv's in my house and I set them up sidebyside to watch MONQUE
and keep an eye on BOSBUFF at the same time  I did the same for the two
afternoon games

Btw those ABC commentaters were great  I was quite impressed they seemed
to know that their audience wasn't likely to be wellschooled in hockey lore
and they did an excellent job  They were quite impartial also IMO

	I think that you are incorrect Roger  Patrick
Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming

they were not great players themselves  

Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than
those of the above combined  Should we name a division or trophy after
him  owner vs player contributions deleted
Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution
or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the 
sport itself 

stuff deleted

The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on and
that is it is the players that are what make the game great and not the
people who put them on the ice
  
As I recall the author of the original article that started the thread
claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons 
Roger on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his
was a jingoistic rant but you also supported the namechanging on the
grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals
they represent FWIW I do not think the flaming was warranted nor do I 
think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all  Just an 
observation

However that aside the real question is whether you like the idea of
changing the names based on the reasons given for it making it easier for
the 'casual fan' or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names
based on individuals who do deserve the honour  IMO the latter is a nice
and unique touch that differs from other sports  In addition I do not
think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of
people that are interested in hockey so it's a pointless exercise anyway

If the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not 
central to the original article  Something to consider additionally is
whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'
would have been able to do so without an organized professional league to
play in  In this case honouring builders of the league as opposed to
builders of the sport becomes a chickenandegg type question although
it was the chicken

Exactly true  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch
is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame  I have
always thought that this was nonsense

Dunno if the Stein comparison is justifiable since it doesn't look as though
his 'unanimous acceptance' to the Hall will hold up

I thought the red light went onthus in the review the presumption
would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the
netfrom the replays I say even from the rear the evidence wasn't
conclusive that the puck was in or outin my opinion

I was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive
evidence that the puck did cross the line  And the replays I saw showed 
fairly conclusively that the puck did not cross the goal line at any

  The Detroit Red Wings put a lot of doubter on ice tonight with a   
washing of the Toronto Maple Leafs  All you Toronto fans have now seen the
power of the mighty Red Wing offense  Toronto's defense in no match for the
Wing offense  As for the defense Probert Kennedey and Primeau came out
hitting hard  Toronto players were being thrown left and right  Not even
Wendell Clark was tough enough for the Wings tough guys  The Wings only gave
up three goals a low total for what they say is a mediocre defense
  All you Leaf fans better speak up now  You team will probable have its
season ended soon  Wings fans keep up the support

There's quite a few Wings fans lurking about here they just tend
to be low key and thoughtful rather than woofers  I suppose every
family must have a Roger Clinton though  But remember to paraphrase
one of my favorite Star Trek lines if we adopt the ways of the Leaf
fans we are as bad as the Leaf fans

Bryan Murray has done very little as GMYzerman Fedorov Cheveldae
Chaisson the whole Russian strategy was a product of the previous
GMMurray has made a couple of decent tradesthat's about it
that would hardly rank him as the best GM

Wasn't Primeau Murray's first decision as GM

Gerald

There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players
The whole Russian strategy is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano
who was GM before Murray  What the previous GM also did was to trade 
away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams most
notably in my memory Murray Craven who had a few very good years with
Philly after leaving here  Also it's not the volume of trades that will 
necessarily improve a team but the quality of them  Trading Adam Oates
for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid even if Federko used to be a 
great player at one time  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly
to the Wings' advantage with those that didn't being soured mainly by 
injury to the players involved such as Troy Crowder who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered

Put Scotty Bowman Pat Burns or any of the other better coaches in the 
league behind the bench of this Detroit team and they could beat anybody

No Caleb it's not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with
it is superb whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN
left off when hockey went to SC this is excepting SC's use of feeds
from CBC   It's the amount of hockey they're showing or lack
of it that we're complaining about  They had rights to two OT's
that could've been shown on Sunday night after baseball  and
they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed
by Super home movies of old car races yes I was checking in

Luc Robitaille was captain of the Kings the first third of the season
until The Great One came back from his disc injury It was kind of
awkward but Melrose appointed anointed TGO as captain immediately upon
his return after which he did not score a goal for something like 
games

I think Luc should have remained Captain all season

I was skeptical before the game but was pleasantly surprised at the
coverage  I was particularly impressed by the close range camera coverage
of work in the corners and behind the play without losing a beat getting
back to the puck

Thorne is good and I've always been a fan of Clement but I miss
Mike Emrick  My boyfriend who is not a hockey fan even looked up
at one point and said These guys are pretty good announcers  This
is the same guy who said that Rick Tocchet looks like Charles Bronson

Mom



I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the JerseyPitt series  Show
the shots not the hits  On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in
on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot  They panned
back to show the rebound  Maybe Mom's camera people were a little more 
experienced

Not to mention Mr Francis is an incredibly nice person  Over Christmas
break a friend of mine had a little Xmas gathering  The two of us drove
to Ron's house  While I stayed in the car out of shyness my friend went
to the door and rang the bell  Ron answered and my friend introduced
himself  He then proceeded to invite Francis to the party  Ron declined
because he had to watch his daughter  He then reached out and shook my
friend's hand  I know this isn't rsb but I don't think Barry Bonds
would be this polite in this situation

Apparently Part  defensemen numbered  through  was lost when I posted
it to make things worse I lost my own copy  I have asked on the Sharks
mailing list on which it did get out to see if someone can mail me a copy
back  If someone responds I will repost it when I get it otherwise I will
rewrite it in a day or two and post it  Sorry about that

	LARRY DEPALMA		Season	rd
Acquired	' free agent from Minnesota
Grade		I CD

No netterfan watching the Sharks including me knows where DePalma was at
the end of the season the Sharks appeared to still have his rights but he
wasn't in San Jose he wasn't in Kansas City and his name hasn't appeared on
the waiver wire  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part
for DePalma  After being called up October  against the Tampa Bay Lightning
DePalma had an excellent week scoring  points in  games while playing good
defense  Unfortunately the yearold DePalma then disappeared the rest of
the way getting just  more points in  more games and generally looked
lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice  He then was sent down to
Kansas City walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated
when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from
the watching eyes of Shark Bytes as the mailing list is now known to Sharks
officials faithful and neither the Sharks nor we miss him

	JOHAN GARPENLOV		Season rd
Acquired	' trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and th round
		pick in ' entry draft from Vancouver
Grade		AA

After an early slump Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest
of the way finishing with  points in  games second highest total on the
team as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob
Gaudreau  Kisio got most of the credit but Garpenlov finishing second in
the MVP voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills as he
was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him
by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting a clubhigh  power
play goals  Contrary to his previous rep Garpenlov also showed that despite
his small size '   lbs he was willing to throw himself around
when necessary albeit not very successful yet  He also still needs to work
on his defense although he improved tremendously throughout the season and
was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season  He will
be a major key to the offense next year

	DAVID BRUCE		Season th
Acquired	' from St Louis in expansion draft
Grade		I 

After a banner ' when he led the team in powerplay goals  and
was third in total scoring  points in  games Bruce was bothered
virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the
lineup for all by  games this season  Of course it is difficult to
speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by
the injury but the yearold Bruce was effective with a man up or a man
short in the Sharks' first season and was expected to be a strong offensive
leader this season as well  The injury appears serious which is a shame
because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead his
future with the Sharks next season appears clouded

	MARK PEDERSON		Season	rd
Acquired	' trade with Philadelphia for CLW Dave Snuggerud
Grade		I B

It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson
after a very good offensive season last season  points in  games but
after riding the pine early in the season Pederson was summarily sent to the
Sharks in exchange of the defensiveminded Snuggerud and he finished with
 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks  He was also limited by
injuries this season and this limited his production  points  But when
healthy Pederson appears impressive with a good scoring touch good size
and the willingness to throw it around although he's not considered a
physical forward and good speed  He also does not appear to be a liability
on defense but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how
much exactly Pederson can do

	JOHN CARTER		Season th
Acquired	' free agent from Boston
Grade		I BB

Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team and the hard
work worked wonders as at times he looked great on ice  However although he
did look great at times the fact that he received just  points in 
games for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can
do and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about
 games left in the season  Carter who will turn  on May  always
hussled but as a result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive
zone while forechecking but he was generally a credit on the defensive end
but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity and he did not impress
offensively although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties  He
is very unlikely to be back next season

	JEANFRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season st
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		I BB

I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the
 games he played this season  He was generally hardworking and creating
opportunities offensively and appeared at age  ready for regular NHL
duty at least for a team like the Sharks finishing with  points in those
 games while not being a defensive liability  Shoulder injury in training
camp before the ' season limited Quintin the team's leading scorer in
exhibition games despite sitting out the final two to just  games with the
Sharks and the Blades that season but he looked impressive  He should be a
solid contender for regular duty next season

	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season st
Acquired	nd round pick in  supplemental draft
Grade		I 

After a allstar season at Kansas City Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the
Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the
Sharks decimated with injuries playing  games and scoring a goal for his only
NHL point thus far  Despite small size '   lbs Beaufait was not shy
to throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good at times
although it's too early to judge him based on  NHL games in which he played
mostly left wing away from his center position at Northern Michigan and
Kansas City

	JAROSLAV OTEVREL	Season st
Acquired	th round pick in  entry draft
Grade		I 

Like Beaufait Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was
up for his cup of tea  games midway through the season  He was generally
very much of a defensive liability and did not show much offensively either
although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those
 games  He may need another season to work on his defense but once his
defense is acceptable he should be ready

	MICHEL PICARD		Season st
Acquired	' trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau
Grade		I BC

The yearold Picard although he perennially tore up the minors seems to
be close to being out of chances for some reason after being acquired by the
Sharks but failing to impress the management in  games scoring  goals for
his only points and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City
He was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive
brilliance in the minors he has failed thus far to score in the NHL although
he has been given limited opportunities  He may be the Sharks' bait in the
expansion draft

	DODY WOOD		Season st
Acquired	rd round pick in  entry draft
Grade		I DD although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all

I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much   Then it is probably
no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far although
 games is a small example  He was generally a nonfactor on offense was
not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing
many fights in the process and gathering  penalty minutes in those  games
projecting to to  in an game season  He's not ready and needs at
least another season at KC where he can work on his fighting skills if
nothing else  His relatively small size '   lbs does not give much
possibility that he can survive at this stage as an enforcer

I finally got it back with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending
it



	ROB ZETTLER		Season	th
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		CC

Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year unfortunately this still
wasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer if that  He works
hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to
costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an
offensive zero  goal and  assists in  games  He would be hardpressed
to make the team next year

	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season nd
Acquired	' free agent from New Jersey
Grade		CC

IMO Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '
playing a combination of good offense  goals and  assists in  games and
good defense  But he playing the first part of this season in Kansas City
was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appears that
' was a fluke  Although he improved towards the end of the season he
was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the
playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last
year  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year

	JAYSON MORE		Season nd
Acquired	' from Montreal in expansion draft
Grade		B

After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp
before ' More had a rather disappointing ' as he was not
particularly good defensively and had just  points in  games  He then
proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the team's most
reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play
steady defense and providing occasional but only occasional offensive flash
Offensively he was even more disappointing than last year  points in 
games but his defense improved tremendously  He is probably best as the
defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman

	NEIL WILKINSON		Season th
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		B

Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '  However
partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed 
games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed
even when playing  He then had often to be saved by his defensive partners
that is if they are there at all  But he also had some solid games and if
he can be complete healthy he can still be a force

	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season st
Acquired	' nd round pick in entry draft
Grade		I A

At the time of his injury December  against the Philadelphia Flyers
Ozolinsh was well on track to be IMO the team's MVP  A serious knee injury
in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season  games
but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen  points
which of course tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from
their defensemen but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities  At the time he
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still
susceptible to socalled rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who
made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran  If he can come back
from his injuries he is ready to be a star

	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season st
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		B

Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two Sharks
to play in all  games of the season  He was solid on defense but
after being billed as an offensive defenseman he didn't show it  points
He was also prone to penalties and his  penalty minutes was second on the
team however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough
physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically  But to
become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and
defensively and cut down on the number of powerplays he gives to opponents

 I forgot to ask Is this the highest points total Francis has

either with the Pens or the Whalers


Francis got  in  his last full season with Hartford

In agreement with your previous post I think Francis is a tremendous and
generally underrated complete player  I would LOVE to have him here in a
Capitals uniform where he would certainly be the  center even though
Pivonka is also a very good complete player who is generally underrated
Francis impresses me in many ways as an ethical Dale Hunter  Tons of
heart and cando attitude with a lot of different skills but none of
the cheap shots and few penalty minutes  Not to mention nearly always
coming through when it's important

Bonjour tout le monde

Well in Salt Lake City this past Sunday the local ABC station decided not
to televise the hockey games  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde
Anyway I have a satellite dish and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday  Apr and I can
not find correct game times  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing
everything from  AM MDT to  PM MDT

I am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday now
that ABC has mucked up the schedule  I think I should be able to
pull in
three games  am  pm and  pm MDT off the dish but I am
not sure

IF anybody has a schedule pleas emial it to me  As you can see I have to
telent to get recsporthockey and it is sometimes difficult to get a link

Thanks in advance

  The Detroit Red Wings put a lot of doubter on ice tonight with a   
washing of the Toronto Maple Leafs  All you Toronto fans have now seen the
power of the mighty Red Wing offense  Toronto's defense in no match for the
Wing offense  As for the defense Probert Kennedey and Primeau came out

Did they move Probert back to defense  Why did I see him parking his ass
in front of Potvin all night  Somebody is going to have to discipline
Probert if the Leafs want to win the series  Perhaps a fresh Clark should
hit the ice at the end of a long Probert shift and straigten him out for
a while


During the regular season when the intensity is down not many teams
have forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of
the opposing teams netand the inadequacy of the Leafs defense in
this regard thus didn't matterhowever the playoffs are a different
storyevery good team is going to have players who are going to
become potted plants in front of Potvinand the Leafs relatively
unphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept

Hard work will go a long way during the regular seasonalmost
to  pointsand the Leafs deserve credit for thatbut in the 
playoffs talent matters because everyone begins working hard

On Apr in Don Cherry  Coach's Corner
user Allan SullivancsUAlber writes
Next a clip was shown from an earlier episode in which Don was
proclaiming Doug Gilmour to be the best player not only in
the NHL but in the world What about players like Lemieux
Don said that Gilmour was the best PLAYER not Designated point getter
Its not like baseball where you have a designatted hitter who
can score runs but can't play defense Gilmour is a good two way player

This clip was shown on local news in Pittsburgh last night KDKA complete
with animated sarcasm by the sportscaster  It's the second time Cherry
has been shown on local Pittsburgh news in the last couple of weeks  Both
times he was blasting Lemieux


His designated pointgetter remarks were not only meant for Lemieux
but for Gretzky Bure etc etc  and he made those particular
remarks last December before Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin's
and as the Leafs started their second half roll and before
Gilmour's great season was being recognized by many people

 more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next

 Also under the new deal there will no longer be radiotv 
 simulcasts  There will be a TV broadcast team and a radio

 No word on who the announcers will be  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald

If you were Pat Burns what would you do

Living in the Bay area I do not get enough Leaf coverage
to pull something out of the bag  I would appreciate comments
on the LeafDetroit rd line matchups  but here is the basic
idea

Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against 
the Wings  They are too small  The key to any Leafs success
will have to be Clark  He is the only centre who can have
any presence within stick lengths of the slot  Where the
hell is Anderson  Anderson can in days past get under peoples
skin  Put a little more bluntly Anderson has to be an asshole
He used to be good at it  We need him now  

Perhaps perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line
I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night
These guys are the swing players for the Wings  Last year they
did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick
exit of the Wings  THis has to happen again   ClarkAndersonGilmour
should be able to out hustle this line  Anderson should do a
nasty on Yserbeart  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard  
Score Gilmour score

Suggestions  ClarkeAndersonGilmour vs SheppardYserbeart
	      AndreychuckBorchevsy  vs Detroit checking line
	      Toronto's checking line  vs YzermanFedorovProbert pray lots

 as suggested  i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up
		 and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan  However
		if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their
		checking line against these finesse players  well then
		let them play

 Potvin can not be faulted on  of the goals  keep him in
 Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either
 The Wings defense shut down the Leafs especially in the slot

I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was outhit outskated and
outcoached on Monday night  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending
or officiating  This calls for drastic measures  or tee off is next Monday

I should have guessed It's time for the annual Pittsburgh Penguins
whineathon Bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the Devils in
Game  I'm sorry Mr Bowman you're a great coach but those cheap
shots were nothing compared to what's going to come Also I guess you
were only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white
It's amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do 

PS  Nice dive on that high stick Mario Everyone knew it was a high
stick you could have stayed on your feet and saved your diving talent
for later

just stirring it up a bit

Bryan Murray has done very little as GMYzerman Fedorov Cheveldae
Chaisson the whole Russian strategy was a product of the previous
GMMurray has made a couple of decent tradesthat's about it
that would hardly rank him as the best GM

There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players
The whole Russian strategy is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano
who was GM before Murray  What the previous GM also did was to trade 
away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams most
notably in my memory Murray Craven who had a few very good years with
Philly after leaving here  Also it's not the volume of trades that will 
necessarily improve a team but the quality of them  Trading Adam Oates
for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid even if Federko used to be a 
great player at one time  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly
to the Wings' advantage with those that didn't being soured mainly by 
injury to the players involved such as Troy Crowder who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered


Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy
than anyone elseand was the first GM to waste high draft choices
on young RussiansDevallano would still be GM but he succombed to
Demers pleading to make the OatesFederko et al tradewhich is the
deal that sealed his fate

Murray has made some decent tradesno doubtbut these are more
due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on
his partWashington was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they
essentially gave him awayand Carson was really a big anchor to
the team and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul
Coffey for deadweight

If Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short
then he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available
and he was unable to pull the trigger  It is his judgement that he
has enough with what he's gotYzerman doesn't have that many more
years in his prime

Gerald Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau although I'm not
ready to admit that's a horrible pick  They hired him after the
draft which has never made sense to me  His first pick was
Lapointe


I don't think Primeau is necessarily a bad pickI'm was just trying
to locate the beginning of Murray's decisionshe slowness in trading
Carson has delayed Primeau's developmentand you have to wait longer
for big players oftenand Primeau can be a very good player without
being a pointagameplayer especially on a team that has Yzerman and
Fedorovif Primeau becomes Joel Otto and gets  goals a season
and plays meanit will have been an extremely good pick

 Podein is an interesting casebecause he was eligible to

 the total scrooges everyone makes them out to becertainly
 in this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the
 New York Rangers

What is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus WC
I know that the Rangers are holding back Kovalev Zubov and Andersson for
Binghamton but I also know that the Whalers wanted Michael Nylander to play
for Springfield while Nylander wanted to play for Sweden The Whalers allowed
the NHL to decide and the NHL chose the WCs How does this differ from the
Rangers and Oilers Did the Whalers have to go through the league or could
they have forced Nylander to play in Springfield


Obviously it is ultimately the teams choicethe NHL would obviously
prefer not to annoy the European hockey federations but the NHL right
now cannot force NHL teams to free their playersthe Whalers probably
did it this way so as to not annoy their farm team affiliate

Here is a press release from the White House

 Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team
April  QA Following
 To National Desk
 Contact White House Office of the Press Secretary 

   WASHINGTON April   Following is a transcript
of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine Black
Bears NCAA Division I hockey champions

                           The Rose Garden

  AM EDT

     THE PRESIDENT  Good morning ladies and gentlemen  It's
an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears the
winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the
Rose Garden and the White House  I understand from Senator Mitchell
that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win
a national championship  And we're glad to have them here

     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to
win the championship but how the entire state pulled together to
cheer them onto victory

     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in
size but also filled with pride and tradition and community I can
understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears
In our state people are still talking about the time we won the
Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team and that was
back in   I'm sure that  years from now the people of Maine
will as proud of this team as they are today

     You know in my state football is a slightly more
popular sport than hockey  We don't have a lot of ice  Laughter
But after spending three months getting banged around in this town I
can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came
here  Hockey is a tough game  It's a hardhitting sport  It does
have one virtue though there's a penalty for delay of game  I wish
we had that rule in the Senate  Laughter

     In government as in hockey leadership is important  In
the United States Senate our team has a great captain the Majority
Leader and the senior Senator from Maine George Mitchell junior
Senator  Cohen looks so young I can't imagine  Laughter  I'm
actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger
than me

     On your hockey team the captain Jim Montgomery has done
a great job  He scored the winning goal late in the championship
game leading you to a comefrombehind victory  something else I
know a little bit about

     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams
and in communities  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and
Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine
must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a
team how to bring out the best in one another and how to come from
behind

     I think it's important as I ask young people from
around America who have achieved outstanding things in working
together to come here to the White House to be recognized and
appreciated by their country to remember that those kinds of values
and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all
of our lives

     We now have another role model and I'm glad to have
them here today  Applause

     The President is presented with team jersey
Applause

     THE PRESIDENT  That's great  I love it  It's beautiful
Applause

     The President is presented with an autographed stick

     THE PRESIDENT  Thank you  That's great  Applause

                                  

     Q  Mr President did you authorize the move on Waco
this morning sir

     THE PRESIDENT  I was aware of it  I think the Attorney
General made the decision  And I think I should refer all questions
to her and to the FBI

     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it
should be executed

     THE PRESIDENT  No they made the tactical decisions
That was their judgment the FBI

     Q  Is this a raid

     THE PRESIDENT  And I will  I want to refer you to 
talk to the Attorney General and the FBI  I knew it was going to be
done but the decisions were entirely theirs all the tactical
decisions

     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this
morning

     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package

     THE PRESIDENT  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my
quarter  Laughter  I was in there  laughter

     SENATOR MITCHELL  You have to pay that quarter

     THE PRESIDENT  I was ready  Laughter  Senator
Mitchell he's worth a quarter any day

     Q  Any chance for your bill sir

     THE PRESIDENT  We talked about what was going to happen
this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to
have for the rest of the week  We only had about five minutes to
talk  And we agreed we'd get back together later around noon and
talk some more

     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your
compromise is no compromise

     THE PRESIDENT  Well I know he did but look Senator
Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for
the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in  and our research
indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 
emergency spending measures totalling over  billion when Reagan
and Bush were President in those administrations  And many of those
purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people
back to work  I don't want to go back and revisit every one but you


can do it  You can look at the research there  So this position
they're taking is not credible  We have a very tough fiveyear
deficit reduction plan  All these costs are covered during that time
and then some  And the very people that are saying this has all got
to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their
position  They've got  years of vote for stimulus measures of this
kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to
work  So I think we've got a chance to work it out and I'm hopeful
We'll see what happens today and tomorrow  I'm feeling pretty good
about it

     THE PRESS  Thank you

                                 END        AM EDT

This is incorrect  This year the Pens had  games on free TV and 
games on PPV  Next year they will have  games on free TV and  on 
a subscription basis  

You actually get  more free game than last year and there will be no
more radioonly games

Its a good deal  Last year everybody bitched about Baldwin breaking

 Well I'm a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to
get the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone
with them  There is no YzermanFedorovProbert line except for maybe on a
powerplay  These three players usually play on three different lines
Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple

Pray for the Wings to become lazy and overconfidentthe Wings
can only lose the seriesToronto cannot win it  Take away
Doug Gilmour and the Leafs are an old Tampa Bay

Right Gerald  And take away Bob Probert and the Wings are dead Octopuses

The Leafs deserve a lot of credit for their diligent effort
during the regular seasonbut if Detroit puts in a reasonable
effort this is not a contest

Let's wait for the body to get cold before we start in with the eulogies
hm  They have only lost ONE game  The game was in Detroit after all and
Potvin did not have his best evening  Nobody that I saw thought that the
Leafs would sweep the Wings  It looks like it might go six  The Leafs
will take the Wings home advantage away in the next game

 and I'll give Fuhr's new one an honourable mention although I haven't
seen it closely yet it looked good from a distance  

This is the new Buffalo one the second since he's been with the
Sabres  I recall a price tag of over  just for the paint job on
that mask and a total price of almost   Ouch

 Ok here's the solution to your problem  Move to Canada  Yesterday I was able
 to watch FOUR gamesthe NJPITT at  on ABC LACAL at  CBC 
 BUFFBOS at  TSN and FOX and MONQUE at  CBC  I think that if
 each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for some odd
 consecutive nights I haven't counted so that's a pure guess

The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year  I had the Rangers
on MSG and the two different games on SCNY and SCA on at the same time  Yes
I'd rather have SC cover it just for the amount of coverage

 
 Btw those ABC commentaters were great  I was quite impressed they seemed
 to know that their audience wasn't likely to be wellschooled in hockey lore
 and they did an excellent job  They were quite impartial also IMO

I think Thorne earns his money  The best part is that he is the same way when 
he is earning his  from SportsChannel as the Devils announcer ie
unbiased  He goes orgasmic for goals despite which team scores and even more 
excited if possible for great saves  He did a good job of explaining certain 
things to nonhockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport
unlike NBC's clowns for the ASG

Ob Playofftime flamebait

      Don't any of you Pittsburgh fans tell me how Mike Lange is better 
      Maybe if he were a little spontaneous rather than reading rehearsed
      lines of BS having nothing to do with hockey he would be better

	It's not really crap you know only half crap    From what i 
understand it's very expensive to play hockey south of the border 
actually it's not that cheap up hear either though once you have all the
equipement it's not more than  a year actually i haven' played in
about  years so i could be off a bit   In the states where ice time
is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year compare 
this to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the welltodo
And this brings up the fact that the welltodo in the US are majority white

BTW what was the original question i think it has to do with the Hispanic

And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded 
resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other 
team captain trivia would be appreciated

Wasn't Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to
Pittsburgh

Mom

Chris Chelios was Montreal's cocaptain with Guy Carbonneau when he
was traded to Chicago for Denis Savard and Peter Stastny was captain 
of the Quebec Nordiques when he was traded to NewJersey Also Mark 
Messier was captain of the Edmonton Oilers when he was traded to New
York How about Dale Hawerchuk with Winnipeg when he was traded to
Buffalo was he captain too  I think so I should not forget Wayne 
you know who when he was traded to LA he was captain Didn't they 
strip Wendel Clark of his captaincy in Toronto 


Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced
to give it up Ramsey's now a Penguin  Ramsey inherited it from Mike
Foligno who's now a leaf  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy
Ruff who went I forget where  Ruff had it from Perreault who
retired so I guess that's where the streak started  Or did it
After all Danny Gare was captain before him and he went to Detroit
Jim Scoenfeld Gerry Meehan and Floyd Smith are the others in
reverse order last to first  I was a bit young at the time so I'm
not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld but he ultimately went to Detroit
and Boston  Meehan went to Vancouver Atlanta and Washington  Smith
seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo but I don't know if
the captaincy was removed before or after that or how many games he
played for Buffalo  This is actually getting fascinating  

Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded almost
unless you're a franchise player

How long can the Leafs play shorthanded and still be expected to
score  They did some fine penelykilling in the first  men down
for a couple of minutes at one point but they just couldn't keep it 
up  They spent virtually the entire game either shorthanded or
just coming off a penelty  as soon as they'd get regrouped they're
penalized again
 
Sheesh  like Gilmour said after the st  you can't go calling 
every little push an shove in a game like that  And if you're going
to you have to do it for both teams
 
Pearson one of my four favorite Leafs played like a bonehead  I
saw him personally screw up at least  good scoring opportunities and
then he got that bonehead minute major highsticking penalty
 
Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a handfull of
games ago and he played a good game  If the other players on his line
can smarten up that line should do okay  Clark's got to get tough 
he's got to intimidate and go for the net  Send Clark up the left 
wing over the blue line a couple times his patented wrist shot will
put some numbers on the board and Pearson heck maybe he should
be benched
 
I hate to repeat Grapes but where the heck was Foligno  Zezel can't
do all the checking himself  and get MacLlwain on the move we 
need some speed out there  Keep Potvin in net he did okay 
considering although like I said a couple weeks ago Potvin 
messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year  he can 
easily do it again
 
My prediction last week was Toronto in   that the games DET wins 
will be blowouts and the game TOR wins will be close  I still stand
by that
 
Don't fret Leafs fans in order to win in  the other team has to
win  
 
Burns is going to make some magic  he'll mix up some lines  Match
the Wings lineperline  He'll have his team checking hard and he'll
never let them get outnumbered in their own end  The Leafs will win
Wednesday night and will take  or their home games probably the
first one

 	Are people here stupid or what It is a tie breaker of cause they
 have to have the same record How can people be sooooo stuppid to put win as
 first in the list for tie breaker If it is a tie breaker how can there be
 different record Man I thought people in this net are good with hockey
 I might not be great in Math but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points
 with different record Manretard Can't believe people actually put
 win as first in a tie breaker

Then allow me to enlighten you Rex You see there's a thing called a tie 
A tie is worth one point I know I know You're not good at math But bear
with me A win is worth two points So getting two ties is the same as 
getting one win If your team played two games won one and lost one you'd
have two points If my team played two games and tied them both we'd also
have two points We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are
different

Perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again I am
starting to sound like Roger or what

All of this is fine  I never said that Murray was a bad GM  I merely said
that he isn't the best GM in hockey or even a contender for that honor
If Murray is as great as you claim the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup
by now probably more than once  If he was as great a GM as you claim

I think you missed one of my points there  It takes more than a great
GM to win a stanley cup even once  Some of the guys on the list you
gave earlier never won one  I agree that you and I could probably argue
back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey
that is a matter of opinion and who is to say my opinion is any better 
than yours or yours than mine  But the point of my original original
post if not well stated was that Murray has the GM abilities but not
the coaching abilities  Which leads to below

and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent
enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success

I think at this point there's a personal emotional element involved here
which transcends Murray's logical thought  As outsiders it's fine for 
us to say He should hire a different coach  In fact he has talked about
doing so in the past  But the press here in Detroit at least has so
built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of
the playoffs as a coach that I think he has taken it upon himself to 
prove to the world that he is capable of coaching a team past the second
round  He needs to as the papers say get that monkey off his back
So it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of pride  Is it foolish
to let pride stand in the way of sound logic  Perhaps but we're all
a little that way from time to time  I think eventually he'll step down
from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties and the team will
improve as a result

I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent
on GM work  In that sense once he steps down as coach we'll see how
good of a GM he really is

But Murray is an average unspectacular NHL coach and a pretty good GM
so none of this is true anyway

I may not agree with everything you've said but it's been fun discussing
it with you

I can't believe that ESPN is making SportsChannel America look good

But only in NYNJ Philadelphia and Chicago Everywhere else the only
reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts
And local baseball preempted the NHL playoffs Thus far into this
playoff season ESPNABC has given me more hockey in  days  game
than SportsChannel did  games

If people want hockey on TV they should watch hockey on TV I bet the
ratings for hockey on Sunday on ABC went into the toilet Next week there
will be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey

Someone in this thread said that he wouldn't watch the games even if
they were on TV and this is a rsh regular contributor

Aargh

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the NHL
He called a total of  penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques
The Nords' penalty came in OT  Stewart being an exNordique himself
was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murderWE WAS ROBBED

No  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost and Ron Hextall is the
reason Quebec won  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending that
goaltending was the key etc etc  Well the key doesn't quite fit if you're
Montreal  

I don't buy this at all Roy was the reason the game was tied and that
would not have been the case had Dionne kept his cool 
Hextall gave up  very questionable goals himself 
Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall but just because
his gaffes were early in the game no one seems to care Roy stood on his head 
for the first  minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from 
endtoend Kamensky's minibreak after the tying goal and the first shot by 
Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy Roy outplayed Hextall 
for most of the game but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero 
because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities

Hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces  he played very 
well but the Haller shot off the post in OT the rebound bouncing over 
Bellows' stick the Brunet breakaway the  chances for LeClair  all 
those opportunities were not finished off by Montreal and it cost them
Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays  

Blaming Stewart is just an
excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst
goals he could possibly allow  He even saw the whole shot dammit

Sure no excuse  but it was just the  goal The timing stank but against
an explosive team like Quebec they gave them  opportunity too many with
a powerplay that was totally unnecessary

Montreal played a solid game although they still don't know how to clear
traffic in front of the net the loss of Schneider will hurt even more 

I disagree Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night 
The defense for the st time this season played remarkably keeping Sakic
Nolan and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night

Normally I would say that any team that blows a goal lead with less than 
five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME 
ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads But I don't
think this was a team loss although Keane should have been able to clear 
the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal  

This most certainly was a team loss Leclair missed his opportunities
as did Bellows and Brunet Dionne took a bad penalty Damphousse and Lebeau
were silent Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night Roy gave
up the bad goal Roy by no means can be singled out for this loss

Roy is paid big money to 
play  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot

And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal Please Roy is paid big money because
that is his value compared to other goalies  and he still is in the top 
when you consider the defense or lack of one that played in front of him
for most of the season

Demers should start Racicot in the next game  If not that he should let
the damn team read the papers for the next day or twoand maybe this
article if possible

The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
comments against the Habs They are no better than uninformed fans Why should
they read the papers They played  minutes of Burnsian hockey to shut
down Quebec All they need tonight and for the rest of the series is the 
extra 

Red Light to face Quebecrubbish That's a guaranteed way to end the
series  Who would be taught a lesson by this 
The fans the media and Racicot perhaps Certainly not the rest of the team

I didn't think the wraparound was as bad as the second goal  I also didn't
think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender can't remember who
in the first place  But you are correct it shouldn't have gone in
regardless

If you mean the goal should never have gone in because there should never
have been an OT then I agree But the goal itself was a great piece of work
by Young Roy had both the near and far posts covered but Young flipped the
puck up under Roy's arm as he wrappedaround the net  not a bad goal at all

Wish I could say I'd seen the whole game but my husband wanted
to watch Young Guns II on another channel Sometime between
the first time I tuned in and d saw the Leafs tie and the next time
I tuned in and heard the score was  something happened
	Please no woofing from Red Wings fans  They're my third
favourite team and if they make it past the Leafs I'll wish them
luck  As for Potvinwell it WAS his fist playoff game

 In article AprlelandStanfordEDU terrygarfieldStanfordEDU Terry Wong writes
 I think that Jack Ferreira's firing eventually led to Kingston's
 firing  You mention consistency of vision  I think the
 Sharks lost that with the loss of Ferreira  There has never
 been a  headed GM that has ever worked  You need one
 person making the personnel decisions at the top not
 management by committee  The conventional wisdom
 from around the league is that Ferreira would have
 made the moves that would have fielded a better product
 on the ice
 
 How exactly would Ferreira accomplished this  The threeheaded GMship has
 taken a lot of heat but nobody's explained how things would have been any
 different had Ferreira still been there  Would Ferreira have made more
 trades  Who would have he had traded  Would he have made fewer trades
 Who should not have been traded

I think the threeheaded GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans
in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant advantage
At the end of last season the contracts of several veterans with somewhat
maginal contributions Fenton Bozek Anderson and a couple others I
can't remember were bought out The idea was that youngsters could
play almost as well and had the potential to improve where these
older guys did not 
And they traded Mullen because he wanted to go not because he
wasn't good enough but I think they were a bit too optimistic
in thinking they could make up for his contributions
An example from this season Skriko was brought in on a trial basis
but not kept because of his age I thought he was a decent
contributor worth keeping around

The youth movement has its advantages look at Gaudreau who
might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around But
you have to find the right balance

  To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota

  From what I have seen in the local news TV and newspaper various people 
in the area are trying to get a new hockey team  A columnist for the St 
Paul Pioneer Press wrote an article giving the inside scoop on the 
issue  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible 
candiates to move to the Twin Cities  First the sites Target Center Civic 
Center St Paul and yes even the Met Center  The columnist was pretty 
confident that Minnesota will get a team and that the Target Center will 
ultimately win out  He argued however that the competition from the other 
two sites will delay the process considerably  Without the 
intersite competition the columnist sorry I can't remember his name 
believes that Minnesota would have a team by the  season  Also 
because of the situation with the Timberwolves things will be delayed 
until unless the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center  
However they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed 
because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for 
conventions and shortterm events even with hockey at Target  To add to 
this mess a STUDY  to  months is going to be conducted on the future 
viability of the Met Center which obviously delays the process even 
further  I hope that the study is cancelled which will have the effect of 
knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging 
Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner The city would be
be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met 
which may happen
	Regarding possible candidates the three teams are 
Hartford Tampa Bay and New Jersey  I would prefer the Devils Minnesota 
Ice Demons although the Lightning may have potential  Although it hasn't 
been announced yet it looks like  neutral site games will be played at the 
Target Center next year  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in 
as many of those six games as possible and I wouldn't be surprised to see 
Hartford and Tampa show up there either	So Minnesota may end up 
getting another team but it may take a few years

I mean that the original poster was looking for a Devils victory
on the tape delay and it didn't happen in game 

I was the original poster and it was just a complaint about the
coverage meaningless Yankee game before playoff Devils game

Oh  I apologize thenI misinterpreted you

No problem no offence taken 

Of all the teams in the Patrick I least dislike the Devils

It is sad just as a lover of the sport that this team can be in
the metro New York area for over a decade and still exist as just
a nonentity 

How is ESPN's coverage anyways I think it starts tonight

We're getting the SabresBruins as the replacement game and probably
so are you while the DevilsPenguins game is played on SCNY and the
IslandersCaps are the overflow game on the SCA SCNY Plus  If the
SabresBruins ends early then we'll go to the DevilsPenguins game
assuming that ESPN follows their previous patterns we got the last
minute of the IslandersRangers and all of the overtime two weeks
ago  ESPN's coverage started last night by accident but as one
or more other writers have pointed out they could've gone to wild
hog wrestling for the evening instead

I can't believe that ESPN is making SportsChannel America look good

But only in NYNJ Philadelphia and Chicago Everywhere else the only
reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts

Yes a point welltaken  however even in areas that finally got
some games there's something nagging in the back of your skull when
the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its
sports news There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City
and we'll try to get you an update through the show  when you
know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there 

If people want hockey on TV they should watch hockey on TV I bet 
the ratings for hockey on Sunday on ABC went into the toilet 

From today's Times ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St Louis a
 and the KingsFlames got a  on the West Coast but only a 
in metro New York ie the Devils squandered their newfound support
from a year ago when they played the Rangers   In comparison
Seniors Golf did better 

Next week there will be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey

I fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great 
I can't tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not 'cos I don't
watch much TV  the NHL should have made sure that it was solid
on cable before going on the air  Even ESPN could've sold second
rights to third party systems ie nonSportsChannel since they
are not making any extra money by sitting on the games  hockey
fans will not necessarily be watching preseason beach volleyball
if playoffs games aren't being shown somewhere

I agree It was great for the ESPN people to show the Detroit game My
roommate just about sht when they threw the octopus on the ice Thanks
for explaining the significance of that BTW The only problem I had was
when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and
music Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the
boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report Other
then that hats off to ESPN Now if they'll only make a habit of this Yeah
right Baseball seasons started Zzzzzz

 Someone give SportChannel a call or maybe Ted Turner
 Wasn't USA network covering the playoffs years ago
 
 Jim G

Oh to be back in the good old days when I lived in Florida Florida for
Petes sake and could watch hockey every night as ESPN and USA alternated
coverage nights Oh well I guess it would be too simple for the home office
to look back into their past to solve a problem in the present

Of course I shouldn't complain At least I'm getting to watch the playoffs
for a change Hooray Now if the ESPN schedulers will realise there are
other teams except Pittsberg in the Patrick Sounds like a Dr Suess Book

This is a general question for US readers

How extensive is the playoff coverage down there  In Canada it is almost
impossible not to watch a series on TV ie the only two series I have not had
an opportunity to watch this year are WashNYI and ChiStl the latter because
I'm in the wrong time zone  We in Canada are basically swamped with 
coverage and I wonder how many seriesgames are televised nationally or even
locally in the US and how much precedence they take over say local news if
the games go into doubleOT

Email me so as not to waste bandwidth please  My news feed is kind of slow
anyways

Summary I believe that game two of the DEtTor series will be rougher
Keywords Fight will break out

  Game two of the Detroit  Toronto series will be a rougher game  I believe
that Clark will be coming out hitting on all cylindars  I believe that Probert
will take exception to this and a fight between Clark and Probert will result
  I know this sounds kind of ridiculous but I know game two Toronto will come
out hitting
  Any takers on this issue

Root for another team 

 Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against 
 the Wings  They are too small  The key to any Leafs success
 will have to be Clark  He is the only centre who can have

Andreychuk is NOT small slow and slothlike maybe but he is
about ' and that is not what I would consider as small

As an aside The big AndreyCHUNK as I call him has been known to
disappear come playoff time  This was one of his main problems when
playing for Buffalo

 Now if we could just clone Chelios's personality and transplant it
 into all of the defensemen on the Islanders Capitals and Devils
  
 Gerald
  
 In other words you want to turn them all into assholes so they
 will spend lots of time in the penalty box and get lots of
 misconducts
  
 And this comes from a Chelios fan
  
  Yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 
  minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the
  best defenseman in the league I'd take a whole team of Chelioses if I
  could That way when one got a penalty the others could kill it

 Thanks for the goals by Steve Smith 
 I don't see why more people don't blame grant fuhr for the goal that smith 
 put in his own net it's common to play the puck back to your own goalie when
 deep in your own end and under little or no pressure from the offensive team
 If fuhr had been in position the puck would have never crossed the line

From this account it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal Mike Smith
came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the
back of the leg Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what
happened The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net Fuhr never
had a chance There was no play back to the goaltender in fact Perry Berezan
of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it 

It was unfortunate that it happened Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie
at the time and on his birthday too But all the blame lies with him Starting
in peewee coaches tell players never to make a crossice pass in front of 
their own net Too much chance of having it intercepted or hitting the 
goaltender or whatever

And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series I can only
say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games
There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late
in the third period of the th game of the second round Everybody on the team
has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation

I was wtahcing RIGHT GUARD HOCKEY WEEK on TSN yesterday and they had
a feature on this guy that does a lot most of the masks for NHL
goalies  They talked about how they are made what they are made of
and the designs that are put on them etc
 
The best one of all was one he never talked about he just held it up
It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking 
black panther on the forehead  it has to be a new mask for Felix
Potvin but he never said whose it was
 
 Are you sure this program was current I know that Grant Fuhr
 had a black panther on the forehead of his mask when he played with
 the Leafs 

It would seem logical that the mask is Potvins His nickname is The Cat 
which would go a long ways towards explaining the panther 

Of course it could be an old story and the mask is Fuhrs too

Yes Colin I have to agree with you here  I've put the puck in
my own net the same way Smith did only once mind you  and it
was definitely my fault  It is NOT a common play to play the puck the
way that Smith did  

Luckily for me  when I did it it was only a scrimmage

By Dave Luecking Of The PostDispatch Staff

At  Thursday night the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer
Their cheer quickly turned into a roar and finally the sellout crowd of
 rose as one to rock the old barn at  Oakland Avenue in a salute to
the playoffbound Blues

The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit  Red Wings  Stars 
With the North Stars' loss the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the
final playoff spot in the Norris Division Good thing because the Blues quit
playing

They held a  lead over Tampa Bay when the DetroitMinnesota final appeared
with  minutes  remaining in the second period They promptly went to sleep
and barely held on for a  victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer
Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers but officiating
supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the
shot had gone into the net after time had expired

I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end Blues coach Bob Berry said

If the goal had counted he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'
disappearance in the final  minutes Holding on for the victory and making
the playoffs tempered Berry's anger

It wasn't pretty at the end he said We played   great minutes as
good as we played all year It slipped away at the end It shouldn't have but
it did

Still the Blues won prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end
Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this
season the Blues still made the playoffs They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks
in a bestofseven Norris Division semifinal beginning at noon Sunday at
Chicago Stadium

The Blues finished the regularseason with a record of  for  points
their fourth consecutive plus season Minnesota finished three points
behind in fifth place with a record of   for  points Tampa Bay
which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues  at Tampa ended its
first season with a record of  for  points

The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous
Blues locker room Instead the mood was one of relief and some disappointment

It's a shame we let down said Kevin Miller one of three Blues to score
two goals Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others
There was no need for a letdown If we'd have kept working it would have
ended  and everyone would be happy

Instead a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs
We won and that's all that matters said Brett Hull scoreless and minus
for the night Once we got up  it was really tough to play

Some players didn't have a problem

Just because the score was announced our line didn't quit said Rich
Sutter who played with Bassen and Miller We still had a game to play You
can't allow five goals like we did that's not right

It was disappointing to see what was going on

Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort Somehow
he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss

I didn't know it was final he said I was kind of looking around on the
bench I didn't realize it was a final for some reason We're in the playoffs
and that's great but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the
end

The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard
operators to keep the MinnesotaDetroit score off of the board The score
showed  until it first popped up with Detroit leading  in the third
period The Blues already led  at the time

I told them I didn't want to see the score I didn't want to know the score
Berry said I felt we had to win the game and that's the approach we took

If Minnesota took a lead Berry feared the pressure of having to win might
bother the Blues If Detroit led he worried the Blues might quit

Until the announcement the Blues played splendidly Shanahan got the crowd
going at  of the first period scoring his th of the season Then
Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period

With the teams playing four on four Miller broke in on left wing deked
defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the
rebound of his own shot with  seconds remaining in the period

Then just  seconds later Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski
after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone

Bassen made it  just  seconds into the second period scoring on the 
rebound of Bret Hedican's shot The goal gave him his first twogoal game of
the season and reminded him of a special friend

Last year Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill who died of a rare form
of cancer at age  on Feb 

I was thinking of my buddy Oliver Bassen said He's in heaven now and
I know he was watching I know he's happy

Miller increased the Blues lead to  on a breakaway goal set up by Zombo
at  Then Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just  seconds
later making it 

Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced Tim Bergland
scored and cut the lead to  But Shanahan scored his st converting a pass
from Nelson Emerson with  seconds remaining in the  second period

Then it was all Lightning Adam Creighton scored  seconds into the third
period prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph Guy Hebert allowed goals
to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of  midway through the third
period

The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the
winner We were in there Shanahan said The game was over We were in

 How long would they support teams that are run on Rangerbased 
 corporate thinking I use the term lightly  We don't need a good
 product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa's
 record every year haha sorry had ta say it

Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic  Not that
they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams but the Maple Leafs and a
certain dead man who was in charge were one of the cheapest teams in the
history of the sport  Guess what they were immensely popular at the
gate  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
playoffs so many years in a row

 Look at British or any European soccer as an example they never have fan
 problems

Ha  Such humor  They have MAJOR fan problems namely that on occasion some of
them don't make it home from the match  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical
much like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when
they play pathetically

Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little
easier for the playoffs Let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of
each other while Chicago sweeps stlouis That just makes it easier in
the second round with all the rest they will get and tordet getting
none For the conf champ they will have a hard time versus the division
but that div will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the
Hawks again Then bring pitt and sure the Hawks will probably lose but
its better to get that far and lose than to not go

Hopefully a miracle ok not quite a miracle but close will occur and
Pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals  If they make it again 
they will probably keep the Cup  If they don't it's the Hawks' turn

GO BLACKHAWKS

CONGRATS TO JEREMY ROENICK FOR BEING ONLY THE ND HAWKS PLAYER TO POST 
BACK TO BACK  GOAL SEASONS

    Don't be so sure the Blues played the Hawks pretty well this season
and won twice at the Stadium The Blues will give the Hawks a hard time
This series is one of the best first round matchups could go either way
The Hawks will probably prevail in seven games

The Ottwawa Senators fired Mel Bridgman at  PM today
Randy Sexton is gonna replace him

Trashy move from a trashy organization After the front
office stated that nobody would lose their job over the
Sens poor performance Bridgeman is gone within  hours
of the teams final game

YesI know he screwed up letting the King's grab Loach

Sexton's qualifications aside from being cheap

	 he played some US college hockey
	 he's pals with club president Bruce Firestone

Just the kind of experience you need when trying to build
an expansion franchise He'll probably be in the Hall of
Fame next year 

This continues a tradition of front office gaffs
 Paul Anka and the arena deal
 Denis Potvin and the GM postion
 Mike Bossy and the scoring coach

How do people in Ottawa feel about how the club is being run

I've heard that you can score on Belfour by shooting high 
because he goes down a lot and on Potvin by shooting high 
on him and then getting the rebound in because he plays so
deep in the net  Any truth to these

It is really annoying to see all of these
predictions on the Net  Who really cares
who you think will win  Please stop with
the predictions we all know the Caps are
going to win the Cup so let it go at that

Yeah but first they have to deal with the Devils
who've had their number all year I'm not saying
the Caps aren't a good team they've been a thorn
on the Habs side for the past  years just
that they won't get past NJ

Farewell Minnesota fans  Get stuffed Dallas Stars

As the North Stars fade to black I hope that MinneapolisSt Paul are
not long without an NHL team  It just seems right that the hotbed of
amateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well  The loss of
the team is certainly not the fault of the fans though the start of the
 season made it look real bad for a while

I wish now that I kept the North Stars cap I bought at Maple Leaf
Gardens the morning after they eliminated Montreal in   I got it
to spite the Montreal fans in the small town where I grew up  What a
glorious season that was for the North Stars

Jagr has a higher  but Francis has had more points  And take it from
an informed observer Ronnie Francis has had a much better season than
Jaromir Jagr  This is not to take anything away from Jaro who had a 
decent year although it didn't live up to the expectations of some

Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowmanstyle
player  He plays hard at all times doesn't disregard his defensive
responsibilities and is a good leader  Bowman rewarded him be increasing his
ice time

Jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude
This rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time

Throughout the year Francis consistently recieved more ice time than
Jagr  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject I am pretty
sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis  When
you add to that Jagr's better  rating I think it becomes evident
that Jagr had a better season not that Francis had a bad one

My vote goes to John Vanbiesbrouck  His mask has a skyline of New York
City and on the sides there are a bunch of bees Beezer  It looks
really sharp

Funny you should mention this one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out
Vanbiesbrouck's mask  He hated it  I think he said something to the effect
of
You see  He was great last year now he goes out and gets that dopey mask 
and he can't stop a beachball

You may or may not take Cherry seriously at all but I cracked up when I heard
it

I think Ed Belfour has the current best mask in the NHL btw  I also like
Moog's and I'll give Fuhr's new one an honourable mention although I haven't
seen it closely yet it looked good from a distance  What's also neat is
Chevaldae's in Detroit they call him Chevy so he has two checkered flags
painted at the top as in an auto race

Let me give my two cents worth in this whole thing

  I am very sick of Pittsburg fansand they are my second favorite team 
talk about how  why can't Bruins forget about Ulf Samuelsson when we have
forgotten all about Adam Graves  Beside the obvious fact that Lemeuix's career
was never endangered by Graves' slash while Neely is still bother by his injury
I think the most important reason is

        ADAM GRAVES HAS PLAYED CLEAN HOCKEY EVER SINCE  WHILE ULF SAMULESSON
        CONTINUES TO PLAY DIRTYYES TRYING TO HIT A PLAYER WHERE HE'S INJURED
        IS DIRTY  FANS HAVE CAN FORGET ABOUT ONE DIRTY PLAY BUT HOW CAN YOU
        FORGET ABOUT ULF SAMULESSON WHEN EVERYNIGHT WHEN I WATCH HOCKEY HIGH
        LIGHTS I GET REMINDED OF HOW DIRTY HE IS

Hitting a player when he's injured is dirty  Can you explain this statement
Do you mean a player who was just injured on the ice or do you mean a player
who is playing hurt  If a player is hurt he should not bother playing because
I don't belive ANY PLAYER should be let up on just because they are playing
hurt

I'm not an Ulf fan but at least I can spot the fact he is like Calgary's
Theoren Fleury in the respect that part of his game is to really piss other
players off as that's part of his job But he lacks Ulf's size

I AM an Ulf and Pgh fan and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves
Ulf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hardhitting hockey nothing wrong with 
that while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to 
intentionally hurt someone which bites

Players that REALLY piss me off are the ones who insist on hitting from behind
or try to go for the knees to injure the players  This kind of garbage has
got to go I would really like to see Muni get pasted as he is one of the
worst offenders

I thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap 
like that  Is it just me or does the officiating just still stink to high
heaven  IMHO if they could get rid of the existing refs and institute a new
system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the troublemakers
then a lot of these things would stop and then the game would be ruled by the
finnesse players  Mario Selanne Bure Messier etal

A fine  year history came to a close tonight as the Minnesota North Stars 
or Norm's Stars whichever you prefer lost to the Red Wings by a score of
  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen who netted
two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to
play

This is very sad indeed  My condolences to the Minnesota fans who are
losing their team

I fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team
left in Pittsburgh will be the Steelers

We should always enjoy things when we can  You never know when they'll
be taken away from us

Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the

The Wings player was Yves Racine and he returned later in that same period

When is the draft this year  And will there be any coverage
I know the upcomming NFL draft is on ESPN

Anyone got the details

Paul Kariya   Pick No  perhaps  He won't last long 

I don't know the exact coverage in the states  In Canada it is covered
by TSN so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage  I don't know

As for the picks
Ottawa picks  which means it is almost  that Alexander Daigle will 
go  He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec  IMO I would
take Kariya  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team

San Jose will then get Kariya

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov I think that's it or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong

Because of expansion I won't go further but I will name other of the
blue chip prospects

    Chris Gratton
    Chris Pridham
    a swedish player who I can't remember his name

Draft Order

 Ottawa
 San Jose
 Tampa Bay
 South Florida or Anahiem
 South Florida or Anahiem
 Hartford
 Edmonton
 Dallas
 NY Rangers
 Philadelphia

the th thru th picks could be wrong  I don't have the standings here
and am guessing 

In my mind there are  top notch prospects in the draft with Kariya 
 leading the way but not going 

Shawn  GO CAPS two first round picks for the next three years  THANKS
                 STLOUIS or should I say RON CARON and SCOTT STEVENS

      As a person who has rarely even SEEN Don Cherry and doesn't know
 anything about him I don't know whether it is just this area
 Pittsburgh of the USA that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether
 he's a Canadian thing altogether  Seriously what is he all about  I
 know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him
 SOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question
 is what is the deal with him  Secondly are the comments of his that I
 read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him
 seriously  I gotta tell you from what I see he really sounds like an
 ass  Let me know  maybe I'm missing something
 
 
 For those of you who complain about Don Cherry and wonder why he is
 popular
 
 the reply is Dick Vitale and John Madden and Bobby Knight and
 Joe Garagiola and Howard Cosell
 
 John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his AllMadden team
 a lot over much better receiversfor much the same reasons Cherry
 sings the praises of Doug Gilmoura little guy with heartyet one
 doesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has
 lost his marbles
 
 Dick Vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or
 that college with outrageous statements
 
 Why should Americans expect that Canada would not have such characters
 in relation to our greatest passionwhich is hockey   Canadians
 are very similar to Americansculturally our sports are just hockey
 and curling whereas with Americans it is footballbasketballbaseball
 and bowling
 
 Gerald

I'd like to add that I think Canadian hockey fans like Don because his kind of hockey the hockey he promotes in his TV appearances is the kind that they think used to get played in the old  team NHL So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days before expansion the Soviet series Gretzky and even Bobby Orr when guys weren't afraid to take a hit nobody floated and defensemen played defence Who cares that that probably never really existed the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in



fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes

Various justifiable rantings on ESPN coverage by several deleted


The only way to change ESPN's thinking if it is even possible is to complain
to them directly  Anyone know there telephone  in Bristol Ct  

Heh Try the recautossport FAQ They are always calling ESPN to complain
I'm sure you could find the number for ABC there too as many westcoast 
viewers were compaining about how something as boring as hockey cut into
the Long Beach GP 


I do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn't think viewers will simply
change the channel from a boring gameI know I did  And then when
they didn't show the NYIWash overtimes I was livid  If I wanted
to watch baseball I could have turned on the PhilliesPadres extra
inning gameinstead I went to bed angryI boycotted ESPN's
morning Sportscenter today I was still so incensed

Were you and several of the other people here it seems asleep the day
contracts were explained ASPN has a piece of paper saying it MUST
show that baseball game if it happens Many businesses payedd money to
have their commercials run during a baseball game This is a business
not your own personal video servant


My wife says I shouldn't go to bed angry but last niteGRRRRRRR


Maybe you should put that anger into something positive For example I saw
ads for the new Dodge both on the ESPN and KBL broadcasts Why not write to
Dodge saying that thanks to the ads run during the STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS 
you will now concider their products in the future They love to hear stuff
like that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time
for hockey games giving ESPN and other networks more incentive to carry
games just one example

Come on people as great as we think it is Hockey does not leapfrog the
big three overight

I think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he
got traded to the Leafs Also wasn't Rick Vaive the captain of
the Leafs when he got traded to Chicago with Steve Thomas for
Ed Olcyzk and someone Speaking of the Leafs I believe that
Darryl Sittler was their captain he'd torn the C off his
jersey but I think he reclaimed the captaincy later on when he
was traded to the Flyers

Oh yeah of course Gretzky was the captain of the Oilers before
he was traded wasn't he

	LARRY DEPALMA		Season	rd
Acquired	' free agent from Minnesota
Grade		I CD

No netterfan watching the Sharks including me knows where DePalma was at
the end of the season the Sharks appeared to still have his rights but he
wasn't in San Jose he wasn't in Kansas City and his name hasn't appeared on
the waiver wire

Sorry Nelson but you forgot to ask me If you check the THN stats for
Kansas City you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games having
played in  games in the period covered in the stats between  and the
 issue  with  PIM Not exactly invisible

He then was sent down to
Kansas City walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated
when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from
the watching eyes of Shark Bytes as the mailing list is now known to Sharks
officials faithful and neither the Sharks nor we miss him

Well having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times this isn't quite
accurate He injured his back a disk injury and did one stupid thing
which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because
he knew he was on the bubble The Sharks then sent him to KC at which
point he disclosed the injury Since he didn't disclose it the Sharks and
he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not
reporting That was eventually worked out the Sharks reinstated him as
injured and put him into therapy and when he was able to play then shipped
him down to KC He fully expects to play in the NHL again although clearly
not with the Sharks hiding injuries is a stupid nono beyond just a
nono

Very nice guy Always hustled his butt off He disappeared because he was
hurt I expect he'll surface with another team at some point probably
another expansion team but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of
his career Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players
motivated Unfortunately he played himself out of the Sharks future with a
bad judgement call


	JOHN CARTER		Season th
Acquired	' free agent from Boston
Grade		I BB

 He
is very unlikely to be back next season

Always gave  best work ethic on the club except maybe Kisio but
hustle isn't always enough His future with the Sharks was made clear to me
one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to
hold Joel Otto against the board He literally had one arm around Otto's
neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm Otto casually turned
around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal as though Carter
wasn't there Hustle can only cover size so far

The Sharks have told me point blank that he's gone for good ditto HUbie
McDonough He was one of the favorites of the staff but as one said to me
you have to make room for the kids Carter in fact refused to report to
KC and has been suspended by the Sharks That might be a defacto
retirement but I haven't heard anything official His only hope in hockey
now is the Gulls

	JEANFRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season st
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		I BB

I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the
 games he played this season

Because at least from the games I saw him in he was outmatched and looked
fairly lost on the ice I think he shows potential but I didn't think he
was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL

 He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season

Agreed BTW I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you
wish they'd performed than how they actually performed I wonder whether you
can really judge talent from radio and television Nelson I know I have
trouble since you don't see the offpuck action your views from home and
my views from the ice differ in numerous ways

	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season st
Acquired	nd round pick in  supplemental draft
Grade		I 

After a allstar season at Kansas City Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the

Coffee Coffey is with the Red Wings

	DODY WOOD		Season st
Acquired	rd round pick in  entry draft
Grade		I DD although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all

I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much

You Nah 

He was seriously unimpressive even as a tough guy his rep However as
few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless I hate
to judge the talent too quickly Butn in Dody's case Im tempted to make an
exception

But I won't

Tom Mees says  we are obligated to bring you baseball

We're probably stuck as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball
deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract  WABC did the same
thing they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 
because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball  The proof of 
the reasons for this is left to the reader 

It's too bad but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team
coverage for their alternate games  We got NESN's coverage of the
BruinsSabres with the Boston homers  they were awful  I've read
that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst  I wonder if he spent
his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing
this job  Everything had to be twisted into something good to say
about the Bruins involved  not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC
Chicago Pat Foley Dale Tallon were this bad  And just to be fair
SC used to take their feed from ESN Empire Sports Network the Sabre
homers and they were horrible too  but they were spacy

From the CNN highlights I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC
coverage of the HabsNords series  Too bad that we couldn't get it
on ESPN with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins

Mike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne
Mike was the original Devils TV playbyplay announcer by the way

the IslanderCapitals game I celebrate as I was actually making progress in
my CS homework because I was so bored by the scheduled game  I tear down and
throw on my jersey Hunter scores I go ape shit 'cause this is the first
caps game I've been able to watch all season And what does ESPN do they
go back to the blowout that NJ hasn't a chance in hell of winning
     The period ends and the sportscaster CAPITOLS JUST TIED IT UP YES

 I watched the game GermanyCzechs in WC todayand i was astonished about
 the behaviour of the German audience
 The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went
 grazy They threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis
 that stupid or what I guess the Canadian referee one of the
 Isostarbros  gave the German team a penalty for that but it didn't help
 much
 I guess the Germans just are proud over their NaziKill'emAllEveryone
 ButUsGermansSucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude
 in every possible sport remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer
 It really pisses me off
 I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks but 
 most of them seem to do

I can understand your anger about the German audience I mean it was the
Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous
penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period The Germans got a
match penalty and a  minutes misconduct for practically nothing and
seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for delay of game
for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd The resulting 
skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point when the Germans
were starting to come up strong
I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events
If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not
able to play for minutes because the crowd is so obnoxious But I have to
admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most
other countries you should go to the US and watch the way they present the
Olympics on television or the soccer crowds in England or the Finnish
spectators at nordic skiing events I mean it makes me sick to see
all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best
teamplayer win and get cheared at I do not mind if my favorite team
looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to
admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team
to watch the German soccer team is boring to watch for example
But reading the above posting I think that you are on the same level as
these crowds you are criticizing It is easy to talk of nearly all
Germans as Nazis and nationalists thats the kind of propaganda that all
ultraconservative people use against Germany It is true that there is a
great danger of rearising nationalism in Germany but from my experience
most of the people at least of the people that i know also regard this as
a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now Why can't we
just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers
corresponding to their nationality eg all Russians are Communists all
Americans are Capitalists all Germans are Nazis all Fins are hanging
around beeing drunk on ferries 
In my opinion your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you
don't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about

Actually I was angry when they went away from the Pens game
Being a Pens fan in central Virginia is kinda tough  I only
get to see them on ESPN and when they play the Caps cause
we're close enough to DC to get all the Caps games so when
ESPN switched to the Caps    AAAGGGHHH

As for the picks
Ottawa picks  which means it is almost  that Alexander Daigle will 
go  He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec  IMO I would
take Kariya  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team

San Jose will then get Kariya

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov I think that's it or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong

The last name is Niedermayer as in New Jersey's Scott's last name because
you guessed it they are brothers  But Rob Niedermayer is a center not
a defenseman

I am not sure that the Sharks will take Kariya  They aren't saying much but
they apparently like Niedermayer and Victor Kozlov along with Kariya  Chris
Pronger's name has also been mentioned  My guess is that they'll take
Niedermayer  They may take Pronger except that they already have too many
defensive prospects


GO CALGARY FLAMES  Al MacInnis for Norris  Gary Roberts for Hart and Smythe
GO EDMONTON OILERS  Go for playoffs next year  Stay in Edmonton

 Los Angeles Kings notes

Playoffs

Stauber disturbed by thirdman theme
by Rick Sadowski Daily News

Barry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the
crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with
the rookie goaltender

I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most
fun time of the year and I'm not  Stauber said with some emotion Monday  I
think I have worked hard enough for that

Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie
in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames Hrudey made  saves in Sundays
 opening victory

But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No  man behind Rick
Knickle  Stauber had a  record and  goalsagainst average down the
stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No  job from Hrudey

Knickle  He won  of  decisions but had a bloated  average twice was 
yanked from games once for stomach cramps and hasn't played since March 

Yet when the series resumes Wednesday Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup
again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic
Saddledome popcorn

If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starterI
dropped too   What happened to No   Stauber wondered  Not that I'd be
happy with No  but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the
playoffs

Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance but Melrose apparently is not
convinced the year old is capable of handling playoff pressure

While insisting he is the Kings' goalie of the future Melrose said Stauber
flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season  They were
according to Melrose a  loss to San Jose on Dec  An  loss to the New
York Rangers on Jan  a  tie with Detroit on Feb  an  loss to 
Vancouver on Thursday

Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could
have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey and he didn't do it Melrose said  An
elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him  The mark of a
great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup

I'm not blaming Robb for the losses but if you're going to be No  you've
got to be able to walk your talk  You've got to be able to play when everything
is on the line  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe I expect
more from him than he does

Ouch  That remark stung Stauber  He began the season  struggled when the
team hit a midseason slump didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed
off the San Diego Gulls roster then came on at the end

I expect more from myself than anybody including Barry Melrose said Stauber
a threeyear star at the University of Minnesota who left school in  only 
to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries

What I've been through the last four years  two knee operations a herniated
disk in my back shoulder surgery  what more can I go through  I obviously do
expect a lot from myself otherwise I wouldn't be here

Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me  I'm not saying Barry 
doesn't know me but don't say I've been without expectations  If anything I'm
a perfectionist

Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned But 
even though I didn't play well I get knocked down from maybe on to three It's 
a bit of a jump he said  You're almost No  or if you play a good game 
you're No  and if you don't you're No   Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a  
and then a   Can you explain that  That's what barry wanted me to explain 
to him why I didn't come through when he counted on me  I don't know What I 
do know is it's a sport  I'll be there

Melrose's goalie of the future statement doesn't mean much to Stauber Before
you know it I'll be  and there will be no future he said



Game  of the Kings  Flames playoff series drew a  Nielsen rating on ABC 
Channel  here in LA  The Kings averaged a  Nielsen rating in the  regular
season games aired on Channel

San Jose fired Coach George Kingston who lead the team to a  mark in 
their nd NHL season  Kingston was  over the past  years with the

 Bill Ranford stopped  shots to lead Canada to a  victory in a very well
 played game

 The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and
 Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding
 Ranford Later on Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom 
 played very well too Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up
 Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big Period ended scoreless but the edge
 to Sweden in creating more opportunities
 Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save Mark Recchi
 made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros Eric one timed the puck but
 Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save At the minute mark Canada
 started applying pressure on the Swedes SandersonDineenBrind'Amour worked
 hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson
 who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman came in on Soderstrom and
 made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post  Canada
 The Swedes picked up their game after that and Peter Forsberg had a shot
 that hit Ranford's post the inside went parallel to the goal line and out
 Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play Jan Larsson took
 a shot from the slot Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by
 the far post passed the puck and Ranford was beat 
 Third period started as the other periods Swedes having most of the pressure
 but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal
 At  Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to
 cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it
 That resulted in a penalty shot since a defenseman can't cover the puck in 
 the goal crease Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot his first ever he
 explained afterwards and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side close
 to the post Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal
 Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside Gartner volleyed a
 bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it  The Swedes ran out of gas
 then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for  periods
 The  goal came with only  second left Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a
 rebound from Soderstrom where the Swedish defense already had their minds
 in the dressing room

 A very good game the best in the WC so far with both goalies playing
 great Soderstrom best player in Sweden but Ranford even played better
 than Soderstrom that tells you something about Ranford Probably the best
 goalie in the world were some comments after the game
 Canada played a very disciplined defense Ranford pointed out that it is
 easy to play well with a good defense Lindros played A LOT and played well
 Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals

 The ForsbergNaslundBergqvist line Sweden's best along with LarssonJuhlin
 Nilsson Swedish defense played well  cm  kg Peter Popovic had the
 task of neutralizing  cm  kg Eric Lindros and managed this very well
 Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC and considering
 that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game he played very
 well Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game partly because
 of the Swedes inability to score and partly because of the linesman's mistake
 on the  goal

 I hope some Finns can provide information from this game I didn't see the
 whole game The Finns took the lead on a Jarkko Varvio slap shot from the
 blue line and a soft goal for an unscreened Mike Richter
 As far as the play in the second period goes the Finns seemed to have the
 most control so a  lead was warranted as I saw it

	Was the ABC coverage of the KingsFlames game supposed to be the
way it was shown in BC with CBC overriding the ABC coverage  When I flipped
to ABC it was the same commentators same commercials even  My question
is  Was this the real ABC coverage or did CBC just black out the 
ABC coverage for its own


Yes it's called simulcast  In Canada when a Canadian station and an 
American station are showing the same thing whether a sporting event or
Cheers on Thursday night the Canadian signal is broadcast over the American
station They even do this during the Superbowl which has the best commercials
of any television  What do we get here dumb Canadian commercials the same
ones we've seen for that last year or so

I'm in Edmonton and while that's usually or at least OFTEN the case
here we were treated to the actual ABC telecast of the KingsFlames
game  I'm with whoever said it earlier  Don Witless er Whitman is
a poor commentator and not just for hockey  Normally if the Oilers
were still playing augh I would turn off the sound and listen to 
the radio broadcast to get decent playbyplay announcing

The San Francisco Bay area media is reporting tonight that the Detroit
Red Wings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs   Can someone who is not
part of the media conspiracy against the Leafs tell me how the game
really went I am expecting a  win for the Leafs shutout for
Potvin hat trick for Andreychuk and a goal and  assists for
Gilmour  If the Leafs really lost how many penalties did whichever
biased ref was at the game have to call against the Leafs to let the
Red Wings win

Ah yes  California  Did the San Francisco Bay area media report that
Joe Montana is rumoured to be the leading candidate to replace fired
San Jose Sharks coach George Kingston  Apparently Montana is not only
coveted for his winning attitude but as a playing coach he will be
expected to quarterback the powerplay

Good thing those walls are so soft eh Rollie

 Wasn't Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to
 Pittsburgh

  And Rick Tochett was the captain of the Flyers when traded to the Pens
recently

Caleb

And let us not forget that the New Jersey Devils traded
captain Kirk Muller for Stephen Richer and Chorske

  The Detroit Red Wings put a lot of doubter on ice tonight with a   
washing of the Toronto Maple Leafs  All you Toronto fans have now seen the
power of the mighty Red Wing offense  Toronto's defense in no match for the
Wing offense  As for the defense Probert Kennedey and Primeau came out

Did they move Probert back to defense  Why did I see him parking his ass
in front of Potvin all night  Somebody is going to have to discipline
Probert if the Leafs want to win the series  Perhaps a fresh Clark should
hit the ice at the end of a long Probert shift and straigten him out for
a while

  What's going on  The Russians and the Czechs are unable to beat easy
opponents and the Swedes beat Austria only 

 It's the openinggame effect maybe Pros arrive late nervousness for
 rookie WC players and problems to get the lines clicking may make things
 hard to get it going against these worse nations
 I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game the better
 it is since the chances of an upset are greater then

 Some other reasons why the worse teams are so tough to beat was presented
 by Hans Virus Lindberg former coach in Switzerland

  The worse teams referring to France Switzerland Austria Italy etc
    have now usually world class goalies

  Their defensive play have become much more disciplined they take much
    less unnecessary penalties

  They use four lines which makes it harder to make them run out of gas

  The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor

  The only convincing winner was Germany  Wierd

 Another weird thing was that the Czechs played entertaining hockey
 err just kidding David

ps Alex I would like to see the Czech roster including if possible
the clubs from which the players come  How many are Finnish German 
or Swiss

 Alex That's a new name for me 

 OK I forgot the Czech roster at home yesterday but now I have it
 I don't know the teams for all players so I would appreciate if
 you guys could fill in the blanks for me especially I think some
 of these players play in Finland

	Relying on Canadian tourists and transplanted Northeasterners to
support a team in Miami is crazy espaecially when you have really deserving 
cities without a team such as San Diego  Milwaukee I wish the Panthers or
whatever their name is well but if they can't sell to Hispanics they're in

was excellent It had a sleek modern look This was the first time I heard
Thorne  Clement  I thought they were great My only request is to leave
Al Micheals out of this He annoys me 
	I'm hoping this leads to a regularseason contract My guess would
be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from FebApril and then the 
playoffs I envy you Canadians with your TSN  CBC Maybe I'll get a dish

First off anyone accepted into the Western Business School is not a dork 
Second just because one person out of a country of  Million doesn't think
before heshe posts an article does NOT mean that heshe is embarrasing
Canada This network is for expressing what you feel are your thoughts Just
because someone doesn't agree with you this does not give you the right to
call them assholes Anyways the North Stars are SHIT
 
C'mon Leafs


Whoa there  Lighten up Andrew  When I was referring to you dorks at
the Western Business School I was specifically referring to those
assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of
Minnesota for no apparent reason  Being Canadian and one who has
friends who attended UWO I personally don't want to be associated with
the idiots who wrote those messages  One more thing Andrewuntil
this season the Leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen
years have they won the Cup during our lifetimeso the North Stars
haven't been the only shit team in the Norris

	On Tuesday when it was raining in Chicago ESPN provided 
bonus hockey coverage  Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off
that the NYWash OT was replaced with the Angels game  People must
realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the US  
The baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so
they can't skip the baseball game  Why don't you people CHILL OUT
and enjoy whatever coverage you can get

seemed to lack a certain fire

When you think of the NHL who comes to mind Gilmour Gretzky Mario

I don't even think the selection of the HArt deserves serious discussion on

Quebec dominated Habs for first  periods and only Roy kept
this one from being rout although he did blow nd goal
Canadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump 
pull back most of the time

Do you notice that nobody on the team is willing to take charge
A dominant defenceman would be nicetoo bad Schneider got hurt
He reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes  Speaking of Chelios I 
wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade
I also wish we still had Corson

Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the 
bench

Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation apparently  I have
no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with
Carbonneau  Savard is skating well and is one of the only dangerous
Canadiens in Quebec's zone with the puck  Too bad nobody is in front
most of the time

Do you also notice that in the defensive zone not a single Nordique
gets knocked down  It's disgusting  We also have Lebeau ' 
getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn '  with no reply
from the team except to yell for a penalty  Dammit Denis Savard 
threw the best only Montreal hit of the night when he knocked
Sundin offbalance  When Denis Savard is your team's enforcer there's
big trouble someplace

Hextall made some good saves but
really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 
 could have had  plus another  in nd

Aside from that second goal Roy did stand on his head  The third 
period at least provided something to look forward to  Habs won the
period IMO and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a
couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game
had started at   Hopefully they play that way at home  Roy made 
the saves we'll ignore that second goal so now it's up to the team

'nuff said  And did somebody say Dale Hunter was a playoff choker
I'd rethink that position

Come on Boston where the hell are you Seven wins in a row and what choke

I'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs Pitt than
Buffalo or Quebec if only because it would be more interesting  Not that
Buffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight but I'd much more enjoy a 
pasteing of the Bruins than the Devils  You have to feel for Terrerrisp

Ah well maybe the Devils will pull it out or maybe the Pens will lose in
the second round but if not I hope the Bruins are there to meet them

   Tonight in Boston the Buffalo Sabres blanked the Boston
Bruins  tonight in Boston Looks like Boston can hang
this season up because Buffalo's home record is awesome
This is great Buffalo fans might get to see revenge for
last year 
 
I'm glad Grant Fuhr will never be as overconfident after two wins
as you areit takes four wins to defeat an opponenteach tougher
to obtain than the previous one  Buffalo is off to a good start
Fuhr is proving the Fuhrbashers wrong but Boston is an awfully
good team
 
Gerald

Awesome home record or not you need to remember the th game last year at the
Aud  I'd like to see some playoff games since I'm stuck in Buffalo at UB but
I think Boston isn't giving up so easy

I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal
and save percentage numbers for me so I can put these stats on the archive
site  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer

Here are the individual goalie stats as of Wed Apr   CST 

These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date
listed above  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper
every Tuesday  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers so those
are not verified  These stats are available by mail every weekday and
sometimes on weekends if I'm in town and I can get late game results  Just
send me a note if you would like to receive these stats by mail

If you have any questions comments or suggestions let me know

Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure  Don use to coach the
Boston Bruins  I don't know exactly when that was  Could someone fill
me in on this info

I think that the name 'grapes' came because as coach for the Bruins 
or in the minors  he used to chew on grapes to keep from getting 
dehydrated during the games  His dog Blue may have been named 
'cause he liked Labatts beer  anyone know about that

  Buffalo is up  is the series with Boston and the reasonGrant Fuhr 
  Fuhr is playoff hungry and he's proving once again why they call him
  money goaltender Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the
  league anymore Statistically at least but he's proving that he can
  make the big save at the right time
  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr and probably would have had a chance 
  against powerhouse Detroit But againwhere was Andreychoke in game 

I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr specifically because I
thought it would help them win at least one playoff series  However I don't
think the Leafs can be faulted eitherthere is nothing to say that Felix
won't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come  

I agree with Joseph  Felix Potvin is a great goalie  Besides
I thought that the Leafs could only protect goalie in the upcoming
expansion draft  If so then it's better to get rid of one good
goalie and get a good forward in return

 The Blues led by the best goalie in the NHL this season Curtis
 Joseph shutout the Hawks  The Blues are playing like they did in
 '  clutch 'n grab shoot the puck out It's incredibly boring to
 watch but if it works
 
  Finally a non Blues fan agrees that Joseph is a great goalie I think he
 should win the Vezina this year or at least share it with Barrasso who also
 has been shadowed by Mario's amazing performance
 

I too think that Joseph has had a GREAT year and should be considered for the
Vezina  I think Barrasso and Joseph should be the two strongest candidates
this year  I don't believe ALL of the hype that Roy Belfour and now Potvin
receive for their goaltending  I do think that they are great in the nets
but I would rather have Curtis Tommy or Fuhr in the nets during this years
playoffs  The big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front
of them and the goaltenders get the most credit  I would rather face  shots
a game than have to rely on Joseph saving  but if the goalie is going to
face  shots I would rather have Joseph or Barrasso facing them

Jay

ps Go Quebec  And I know that McLean and several others should be mentioned
as candidates for this years Vezina but I am partial to Joseph and Barrasso

 So in other words if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out
 the Penguins that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision Come on
 Joe think about what you're saying Who they played is VERY significant
 Why they played them is what's irrelevent A low GAA against good teams
 is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two
 goaltenders A low GAA is better then a higher GAA A low GAA against good
 teams is much much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context
 of comparing two goaltenders

Let's start over  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender  I'd
take Soderstrom right now  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a 
netminder  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game less than
that after last night their save percentages are close and their records
are similar  And with that I just don't see how you can label Roussel as
the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season

You say Soderstrom played against better competition  That may very well
be but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in
those games  Besides against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh
the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose

 The same
 for Roussel in the Ranger game Two real scoring chances one he made a
 great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player If
 you were judging Roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by

But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone  I've seen him play
for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey  It's just
my opinion but I think he's got what it takes  Of course I thought that
about Mark LaForest too  But I never did about Wendell Young  So I'm
batting  in judging Hershey talent since the Hextallera

As for the Rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the
offensive player if you like  But Rou had his leg in position to make the
save  If he didn't it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't
get the puck up or not  It would have been a goal  On a breakaway that's
what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the
shooter to beat him

 But if you were to look at the  tie against the Habs you saw a goalie
 stand on his head to get that shutout THAT was a  goalie in action Roussel
 doesn't have a game like that in him

I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on
opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the twotime defending
champs  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was
senational in that game agains the Habs  But you can't tell me that a
Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game
and just flat out missed it  Mistakes both on offense and defense are
part of the game  Or there'd never be shutouts

Anyway I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and
I'm not going to argue about it anymore  Besides with the current
game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year I
don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any
tickets next season

Tom Barrasso wore a great mask one time last season  He unveiled it
at a game in Boston  

It was all black with Pgh city scenes on it  The Golden Triangle
Pgh's downtown area where the  rivers meet graced the top along
with a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena I think on the 
other   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens' logo the really
fat little penguin with the blue scarf the current at the time Pens
logo and a space for the new now current logo

Tommy had designed the mask and his mother an artist painted it
for him  

But while wearing the mask the Pens got thumped by the Bruins  The
very next game Tommy was back to the old paint job  A great mask
done in by a goalie's superstition

Jagr has a higher  but Francis has had more points  And take it from
an informed observer Ronnie Francis has had a much better season than
Jaromir Jagr  This is not to take anything away from Jaro who had a 
decent year although it didn't live up to the expectations of some

Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowmanstyle
player  He plays hard at all times doesn't disregard his defensive
responsibilities and is a good leader  Bowman rewarded him be increasing his
ice time

Jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude
This rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time

Throughout the year Francis consistently recieved more ice time than
Jagr  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject I am pretty
sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis  When
you add to that Jagr's better  rating I think it becomes evident
that Jagr had a better season not that Francis had a bad one


  Actually what I think has become more evident is that you are determined to
  flaunt your ignorance at all cost  Jagr did not have a better season than
  Francis  to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
  hockey knowledge  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty

  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
  time per game and some measure of its quality ie is the player put out

  against the other team's top one or two lines shorthanded etc I would
  much rather see the  disappear altogether instead of having its dubious

 You'll have a hard time selling any sport to a community that
 can't play it on account of availability or financial reasons
 Hockey is pretty much a sport for the white and well off
 
 What White yes Well off definitely not Hockey season ticket owners have
 the lowest average income of any of the four major North American sports

Do you have a basis for this claim  Try these stats taken from Playboy Magazine
June 

Percentage of pro football fans who have attended college    
Percentage of pro baseball fans who have attended college    
Percentage of pro basketball fans who have attended college

Percentage of pro baseball fans who make more than K      
Percentage of pro basketball fans who make more than K    
Percentage of pro hackey fans who make more than K        

 
 And think of where the majority of hockey players come from From a farm out
 in Boondock Saskatchewan or Weedville Alberta
 

The biggest advantage that kids from Boondock or Weedville have is the
availability of ice  In the San Jose area we have a population of 
and that population is served by  ice arenas  In contrast Kamloops
British Columbia has a population of about  and has  rinks  There
are also myriad ponds pools etc that freeze in the winter  Down here
it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle up there it's hard to find a kid
without a pair of skates  And before you say what does he know He's from
California let me say that I was born and raised in Trail British Columbia
a town of about  with lots of ice in the winter  My father did radio
play by play for the local team the Trail Smokeaters who by  the way were
the last Canadian team to win the World Championship back in   I was
on skates almost as soon as I could walk and have been playing recreational
hockey for about  years

 When was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city
 The insurance alone is a big enough barrier
 
 The inner city isn't the only place that is poor
 I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is no ICE to play on


Lack of ice is a big factor but costs is a bigger factor  Both my kids play for
the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season which just ended
cost me  per kid for membership in Hockey USA plus  per kid for club
dues  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance and the club dues
cover ice time officials trophies etc  Other areas have similar fees unless
the city government subsidises some of the costs as Stockton does

By the way most ice arenas are located in what could be called the inner city
areas  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions  Redwood City's rink is in an
industrial area on Bay Rd near  Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther
King Stockton's is in Oak Park Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown
I forget the name of the street Fresno's is out on the edge of town just west
of   Santa Rosa's is a nice rink but it's in an older section of town
Dublin's is outside of town off   Most of the rinks are old and expensive
to run with huge electric bills and insurance premiums  If you want to buy ice
time expect to pay around  per hour at any of these rinks  Some of them
give you a  minute hour for your money others give you a  minute hour and
include the resurfacing time in the fee

It is a long standing good luck Redwing's tradition to throw an octopus 
on the ice during a Stanley Cup game They say it dates back to '
at the Olympia when the Wings became the st team I think to sweep 
the cup in  games A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats
than from the old Olympia balcony though

Funniest I ever saw was when some Tiger fans threw one on the field
during a DetroitToronto baseball game   I was living in California
and the folks I was watching with had never heard of hockey and were 
incredulous when I recognized the octopus BEFORE the camera closeup

Thank you for posting this  As the person who first brought up the
fact that Jagr has a much higher  than Francis I can assure you
that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of 
comparisons even on the same team  I never ever thought that anyone
would argue that Jagr's higher  actually reflected better twoway
play

In my opinion Francis's low  is purely a result of him being asked
to play against opponents top scorers at all times the fact that he
can chip in  points while neutralizing the other team's top center
is a testament to how valuable he is even if his  suffers  On the
other hand Jagr for how big fast and skilled he is can't even get
 points no matter how inflated his  is

By the way don't get me wrong  I like Jagr  He may be a lazy
floater but he turns it on at exactly the right times  like
overtime of playoff games

Well I think it in  the Montreal Canadians finished st although
there was no President's cup in those days and missed the playoffs 
in  I do recall that the  playoff picture wasn't decided until
the final day when the NY Rangers defeated the RedWings The tiebreaker was
the number of goals for if I remember correctly so the Rangers played
with an empty net for the entire game Some Hab loyalists accused 
the Wings of 'throwing' the game to keep them out but as I recall 
Gordie and Delvecchio had the flu so coach Sid Abel sat them out

Just heard on the news that Mike Keenan formerly of the Blackhawks Flyers
and General of a Siberian Prison has just signed to coach the Rangers  The
Rangers who won the President's Cup last year have slipped just a bit at the
end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly Flyers
The Flyers' fans are going to be disappointed on Keenans decision because
they were very interested in him  Oh well

After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that
Milwaukee should have an NHL team I thought I'd pass along a story I heard
recently  This is second hand so I don't know how true it is but I have
no reason to doubt it either

Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge
hockey team  The owner of the Admirals sorry I can't remember his name
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
Bradley Center

Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise but 
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of  million was too
high

Like I said I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if
it's true don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon  The Admirals
aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club
and a minor league club in the same building especially since the NBA's
Milwaukee Bucks play there as well

It'd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsen's
contract to be Keenan's assistant   Roger did do a very good job
with the mediocre players just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks

   Boston doesn't have the guns of the Pens but the Pens doesn't have
the defense goaltending and discipline of Boston Still Boston can

Why do you say this  As of now the Pens and Bruins have played the
same number of games and given up the same number of goals  They are
tied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league behind
Chicago first and Toronto second  The Pens' weak spot is defense  Only
by comparison to their offense which is second in the league to
Detroit  But the Pens are no weaker on defense and goaltending than the
Bruins are that is they are both very strong

Well well they don't like our defenders mainly Lumme and Numminen

Now do YOU think that Ruuttu is only worth   I think it might be 

 RTeemu Selanne
 
Compared to Kurri Selanne's points are too high lets make it  or 


 well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of
 Markus Ketterer the goalie  or the players listed above and luck There's
 presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at
 the highest level but still valuable role players however My guess would be
 that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a  team in the NHL

Wow now it looks like you don't like our players What about guys like
Nieminen Jutila Riihijarvi Varvio Laukkanen Makela Keskinen and even
if he is aging Ruotsalainen The main difference between finnish and North
American players is that our players tend to be better in the larger rink
The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe 
And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck though
they helped I think that the main reason was that the team worked well
together

While watching the PenguinsDevils game last night I saw the slash that
Barrasso took on the neck  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate  I think he was a Sabre but I'm not positive
Does anyone rememberknow his name  What has happened to him since  What
about the player whose skate cut the goalie  Name  Info  Has this ever
happened before in a hockey game   

It was Clint Malarchuk's neck cut by Uwe Krupp's skate  I know it happened in
Buffalo but I can't tell you against whom

Krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net

Malarchuk became the fourth goalie behind Hasek Puppa and Draper after
suffering from ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder  He's been playing in San Diego
for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley

Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaineTurgeon trade

It was unlikely improbable  For the Bruins it was the stuff of
nightmares for the Sabres it was a taste of heaven  
   For the first time since  the Sabres have won the first three
games of a series  Last time was a three games to none victory in a
best of five against the Canadiens  It takes a little more work this
time  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work
   On the heels of a shutout one that took away Boston's home ice
advantage the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win  It
wasn't easy  It wasn't always pretty  It still worked
   John Blue got the nod for Boston supplanting Andy Moog as starting
goaltender  Moog was pulled midway through game  on Tuesday
Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny his fourth of the playoffs on
the powerplay with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box
LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists  Goal number two was
Khmylev's first of the playoffs a pretty goal scored when the Sabres
stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev  Smehlik and
Hannan assisted  Determined not to be shut out Boston tallied on a
shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay with Colin Patterson and Bob
Sweeney both in the box  Period two was scoreless a split of
penalties between the two clubs  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get
his first courtesy of Oates  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes
later from former Bruin Bob Sweeney Khmylev and Carney  Neely tied
the game  of the way through the third sending it into overtime
Last year overtime meant a Bruin win  Last night it spelled sweet
revenge as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box on a
tip in by Khmylev Hawerchuk and LaFontaine a minute into overtime
Both teams finished with  shots  
        Powerplay conversionsBoston  Buffalo 
        RefereeRob Shick

Comments  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third allowing a lot of
clutching and grabbing  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic
again  Mogilny was checking  Granted he missed once and instead
flung his body into the boards but checking like this is a novel idea
to Mogilny  The crowd was unbelievable  I don't think I've ever
heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game remember I was
only five when they played for the cup  I don't remember it and no
one took me to the games  Doug Bodger in a postgame interview
noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk but the crowd was
too loud even though he was shouting  It didn't seem to matter as
most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great  Yuri Khmylev
didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't
skate out when his name was called  Sweeney  and Fuhr  each
were out before Yuri made his appearance sans jersey  When asked in
an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was he
responed yes ok it was through an interpreter and he said more than
that even more than the interpreter said but I digress  The
interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English he
must not understand playoffs  Uhhuh

On the other hand I'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes
Fereirra made  Imagine indeed but then again we have the benefit of
hindsight

Well the jettison for youth fast strategy was his Also in hindsight it
didn't work all that well but I think it was more because it left the
Sharks on a tightrope without a net not that it was inherently flawed It
was the injuries that caused us to fall

Let's say that in the view of the Sharks' upper management the attempt
to trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra

From all indications it wasn't the major factor but the last straw
There were personality conflicts among Shark management and disagreements
over how personnel were going to be handled not just who was being traded
vs kept but who was being sent to KC What Ferriera did if rumors are
right was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed

I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view  they should have kept
himhe's obviously the luckiest man in hockey

I think if they'd kept Ferriera they would have lost some of their other
management staff Depending on which sources you trust we might have lost
Grillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer Frankly I want to keep
those three we may well ahve also lost Kingston which of course is now
a moot point 

The Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly
consensual and cooperative Ferriera wanted to run things his way There
were conflicts Ferriera lost That says nothing about his skills or
accomplishments  at that level a lot is personality and politics 

I think he did some good things for the Sharks but that he never fit in as
a Shark person I hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in
Anaheim too because it'll be good for hockey but I want the Ducks to be
doormats for a couple of years so the Sharks succeeed first

 BG hey I saw that game  I thought the Sabres looked better that you
 BG described It's Boston that looked weak and unsure of themselves  Even
 BG if big if they bruins win the third game what's that going to
 BG prove  They be lucky


     Well now the Sabres are up    in games and its to
     bad that Boston isn't putting up more of a fight as
     that could have been the best series of the playoffs
     I think Boston will come out smoking in the next
     two games and that Buffalo will end the series in
     game six back in Buffalo and say how about those Islanders
     they are up    on the Capitals and will probably
     win the series only to be clobbered by the Penguins who
     should eliminate the Devils in the next game
     I cannot see i'm sad to say anyone beating the 
     Penguins this year again and they will take cup   
     I'm afraid  well talk to ya later

I feel the jury is still out on Tim Cheveldae as a playoff goalie
He was average in his first playoffs  Last year he had a horrible
start but played great the last ten games after he was benched
His GAA even with the horrible start was  last year  This year
I think he's going to play very well he has to if Detroit is going
to win the cup  He wasn't sharp in game  but he didn't have to be
I thought he looked pretty good yesterday

Charles Hubbert writes
Great write up of the WingsToronto series thus far  I agree with just
about everything that you said but Chevy shouldn't have let the shot from
the right point in  First goal Mikorov I think  Other than that the
Wings are looking good and Chevy is holding his own  Not great but maybe

Chevy has let in  or  soft goals so far but they all didn't matter
However his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up
big when it counts  The score was  I think when the goal you mentioned
was scored  In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming
back Chevy was exceptional  I can see him as a Barraso style playoff
goalie  inconsistant when there's nothing on the line
but comes up big when really needed  I guess we'll both find out

Summary Tod Hartje on Letterman
Lines 

In article  of recsporthockey sclarkepasutorontoca 
Susan Clark asks
Hi guys
        I'm looking to answe a bit of trivia  What hockeplayers have
appeared on major talk shows on TV ie Letterman CarsonLeno
Arsenio etcie shows of a national natureinclude Canadian equivalents
if you can think of any  This can include NHL Olympic and World Champion
ship players  I'm pretty sure I've seen Gretzky and Lemieux but I was
wondering if there were any others


I am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game but Tod Hartje
who played for Harvard in college and then went on to play in the AHL
initially for Moncton and currently for Providence thanks to Daryl 
Turner for the update appeared on David Letterman's show about two
years ago now

Tod has the distinction of being the first American born player to go 
and play in the former Soviet Union This was arranged by Jets GM Mike 
Smith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those 
European players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL

Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of
the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years
He wrote a book on his experiences called Behind the Red Line check it
out and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them

 Mike 

Note I hope I have my facts straight It has been a year since I
read Tod's book I wanted to dig the book out to double check but 
realized I lent it to a friend and he hasn't returned the book yet 
Just wait 'til I get a hold of him

The overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the Quebec

take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first

I agree that it was a great game good to see Roy and Damphousse back

During the first three games of the PensDevils series I have been
impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens  Jagr
MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch  But one
element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman

Despite Brooks' lunatic comments and despite the Devils' line changing
adantage in last night's game Bowman has been able to keep his cool and
keep the Devils in the dark  Granted the helldwellers had the Pens
bottled up for a while last night but Bowman was eventually able to
configure his lineup to get the job done  His ability to throw out new
looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible

Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an
individual basis  Last night for instance he realized that the speed
of Jagr Straka and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance  As
a result Straka received many more shifts than average Jagr played
almost the entire game he was always on the puck and MacEachern
scored a goal while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night
His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is
commendable especially when a coach of such a talented team might
simply rely on the overall talent to dominate and to bring about
success

While no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson
Bowman in his own way has made himself a permanent though not clearly
seen mark in  Pittsburgh

Dino getting shots in front of the net he should expect it  This is playoff
hockey where anything goes You lose one game in the regular season and it's
not so bad You lose a game in the playoffs and it's a difficult thing to
overcome  I've watched hockey and played it too for a number of years and
I haven't seen one postseason game where the forward in front of the net 
has not finished without any bruises on the back of his leg  The Leafs are 
not doing a good job in clearing the net and Potvin has been forced to take
matters into his own hands  I remember when Cicarelli used to play for the
London Knights OHL he always was a nuisance in front of the net and the 
goalies took exception to this  He also complained in this morning's paper
about what happened last night but to me it's a lot of bellyaching His 
team is up  and he complains about being whackedI wonder what would
happen if he tried to do the same thing in front of Billy Smith or a younger
Ron Hextall Seems Dino would need two artifical legs  Dino should take it 
as part of the game and thank his lucky stars that he's in the playoffs and
has a good chance to go the finals


Well I agree that if you're going to stand in front of the net
that you should expect to get hit and hacked at In general you
should expect to finish the game with some bruises However
there is a fine line between hacking at a guy causing some pain
and discomfort and blatantly attempting to injure another
player Felix Potvin IMO crossed that line on Wednesday That
two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line I lost a lot of
respect for Potvin because of that It showed an immaturity He
did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the
slot area a legal position for Dino to be in Instead he
slashed in an attempt to injure It was out of shear frustration As a
Leaf supporter just a supporter I'm not a Leaf fan really I
was very disappointed

You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall at least
in his Philly days They both crossed that same line at times and
for that reason many fans and players disliked them that's
why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about
these issues Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again I'd
hate to see anyone even Dino  although I admit I don't like
him very much get seriously hurt from such careless but
intentional use of the stick

While watching the PenguinsDevils game last night I saw the slash that
Barrasso took on the neck  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate  I think he was a Sabre but I'm not positive
Does anyone rememberknow his name  What has happened to him since  What
about the player whose skate cut the goalie  Name  Info  Has this ever
happened before in a hockey game   

It was Clint Malarchuk's neck cut by Uwe Krupp's skate  I know it happened in
Buffalo but I can't tell you against whom

Krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net

It was NOT Krupp's skate  Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle
of the Blues  They both sort of tripped and fell toward Malarchuk
and Tuttle's skate came perilously close to cutting but actually just
missed the jugular  Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice hands at
his neck blood on the ice

Malarchuk became the fourth goalie behind Hasek Puppa and Draper after
suffering from ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder  He's been playing in San Diego
for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley

He'd been suffering from it for over a decade  He just wasn't
diagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to
have some alcohol to help him sleep  Unfortunately he'd just been
put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier  It's amazing he lasted as
long as he did  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between
reality and imagination or fail to accept that something they've
checked is OK now  For example an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands
over and over and still think they're dirty  He might check the oven
ten times to be sure it's turned off  He might see a movie about
something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his
own life  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes
but still needs it  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD
episode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days  He felt
it slowed his reflexes so he tried to go without  In any event he
is alive and well and living in San Diego while playing with the
Gulls IHL  


Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaineTurgeon trade

And Tuttle is no longer with the Blues but I don't know where he is
Possibly in the IHL but you'd best ask a Blues fan

 Go Pens

That would be Clint Malarchuck  It was speculated at the time that
the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end
of the rink at the time he was playing in the same end as the
ambulence is parked he never would have survived  Ditto if he
were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on 
standby

If you've seen video tape of the incident it is amazing how much blood
there was  It was literally spurting out all over the ice as Clint
grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror  

Amazingly enough he made a full recovery and played again in the
NHL  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway
and didn't play for too long afterward  Some people speculated that
he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident and I
think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward
He did eventually get back to form and played another year or so after
that and then I believe he retired

Anyone else

The Isles picked one hellofatime to get their first win all year after being
down after  periods The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady
defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci The Isles power play
philosophy continues to be dumpandchase which except for boardaholics like
Flatley doesn't work against the Caps I hope Al realizes this They have too
many talented finesse players so why not carry the puck in and setup If
last night's game is any omen the Isles could be on their way to that ole
championship form COMING from behind late in a game My advice to the Caps is
to pounce on those Healy Rebounds Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the
last period and overtime despite an almost swollenshut left eye injury
suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for
the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an 
Italian from the past JOHN TONELLI It was Tonelli who won a similar game
against the PENS in game  on the  playoffs The Isles scored two late third
period goals to send the game into OT tied at  In OT Tonelli scored the game
winner to send the Isles to the next round The Isles have lacked this tenacity
for years but perhaps its BACK It was good to see the Coliseum packed just
like the ole days Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way

Lots of debate about the virtues of Bryan Murray vs Pat Quinn as a GM
deleted  Randy Graca seems to think Murray is the best GM in the league
I think Quinn is one of several who are better

Plus his team Quinn's has improved a much greater amount than Detroit since
he took over with them

How do you figure  Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year
They both won their division they had close to the same number of points
they both went down  in the first round of the playoffs before finally
escaping in  games and they both got knocked out in the second round by
teams they should have been able to beat with less talent  Specifically
if I remember correctly third place teams  How does this make Vancouver
more improved  Further if I'm not mistaken the Wings had more points than
Vancouver at the end of this season albeit not many 

When Quinn took over Vancouver several years ago NOT LAST YEAR they 
regularily missed the playoffs  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs
the year before his hiring but they probably did  Quinn has improved the
team from nonplayoff calibre to a serious contender

When Murray took over in Detroit the were about a  team that was a
contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup
contender

So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM
Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray

Yahooooooooooooooooooooo

What a game we finally beat those diquesand in OT
The Habs dominated this game and especially in OT

They finally started going to the net  See what happens when you 
create some traffic  Muller deserves full marks what a player
and Damphousse finally started skating  Roy thankyouthankyouthankyou
was excellent  Did you see that third period save on Young  And the 
defense was taking out Quebec players in the zone

Anybody else wonder if Hextall will feel like a dweeb when he finds 
out that the winning goal went in off his own Dman's skate  Whatta
suck  Although he is playing really well

Life doesn't get better than this

Sure it does  On Sunday when the B's are golfing and the Habs are tied
 you'll see what I mean

During the first three games of the PensDevils series I have been
impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens  Jagr
MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch  But one
element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman


Bowman is in the Hockey Hall of Fame as a coach alreadyand unlike
Gil Steinhe didn't get their by stacking the Board of Directors 


While no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson
Bowman in his own way has made himself a permanent though not clearly
seen mark in  Pittsburgh 

Bowman is the geniusJohnson isn't  Bowman is a great coachJohnson
a very good one  However Bowman is really not a modern coach and
Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days and
delegate most of the daytoday responsibity to the assistants is
a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part

Amongst Penguins' fans there seems to be an inner calm that I've never
experienced before this year with the Pens The players and the fans have so
much confidence in the team this year We're savoring every game and saving
our energy for the Stanley Cup

That's not inner calm  It's boredom and it's being spoiled  The Arena's
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just
take winning for granted  It's been seemingly forever since the team
lost and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and
surprise at victory

While I'm glad to have the Pens doing so well in some ways it was a better
high back when the Pens beat the Bruins two years ago and the Rangers last
year Too much of a good thing is not always good for you

Here's one from the mill  The Oilers MIGHT move to Hamilton
where Porklington can get a free deal


The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere

Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is
because he is at the moment of maximum advantagethe provincial
government is months away from a provincial electionit is
the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands
to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price
and it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with
the players which might involve some enhanced revenuesharing

Pocklington is many thingsstupid is not one of them

He can dictate termsbecause other cities will pay his
price if Edmonton doesn't

Edmonton has already fucked up its international airport and
surrendered supremacy to Calgary and over the next few years
Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks
It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find
a way to lose its hockey team toobecause Northlands wants
to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing

However in this case about the longterm financial
viability of the Oilers the fact is that Pocklington is basically 
right regardless of who owns the team and it is right to provoke
the crisis now before the team accumulates millions of dollars
in losses or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack
of money

 Does anyone rememberknow his name

	Clint Malarchuk


  What has happened to him since

	Assigned to San Diego Gulls at the being of the season I believe

It was Uwe Krupp and a Blues player though Uwe's skate I beleive cut

When Quinn took over Vancouver several years ago NOT LAST YEAR they 
regularily missed the playoffs  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs
the year before his hiring but they probably did  Quinn has improved the
team from nonplayoff calibre to a serious contender

When Murray took over in Detroit the were about a  team that was a
contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup
contender

The last year before Bryan Murray took over the Wings did not make the
playoffs  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques
Demers first arrived in his last two years they were respectively
embarrassed in the first round by Chicago and then failed to make the 
playoffs at a time a might add when there were only five teams in the
Norris

It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before 
Quinn came but in those years the Smythe Division was a lotI mean a lot
tougher division than the Norris also known as the Snorris division
Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary both very legitimate Stanley
Cup contenders eight times a year while Detroit got to play such 
powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota  Now Edmonton is hardly even a force
in the league and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks while
over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving so was 
everybody in the Norris except St Louis  Detroit had to improve just
to keep up with the competition in their division  They had to improve a
lot to get better than their competition in the Norris

Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent  For really good
players they had Yzerman Burr and Probert and that was about it  And
no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good The
rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans  The only reason
they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the
coaching of Demers who at least at first got every last ounce of effort
possible out of his team  Then even his coaching began to degrade

So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM
Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray

There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings
wise when Murray took over as Vanc was when Quinn took over some of which
I outlined above but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with
at the outset than did Quinn with the exception of Yzerman  And one player
cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender as I'm sure everyone
reading this will agree  

We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they
face each other in the conference final assuming they don't get knocked out
like last year

    The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules  Overtime time games
    that are not shown  What the hell kind of shit is this  If that would
    have happened to the Flyersif they were in the damn playoffs to begin
    with while I was watching I would have gone throught the roof

    However everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN but they are not the
    ones to blame  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break
    whenever they want to  The NHL is to blame  When they signed the
    deal with ESPN they had to know of this  They had to know shit like this
    would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority  The NHL
    should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN  How can the
    NHL do this to its fans How dare they  We are the ones that make the
    damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to
    watch  They more I write about this the more pissed off I get  We must
    let the NHL know that  we expect a little better than this  If anybody
    out there knows how to go about doing this let me and everybody else know

    Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it

    Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey  All that fucker has to do is fall
    on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least   Last night in the
    rd game between NJ and Pitt he was being pushed while skating across the
    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off  The guy on him was
    doing a good job so he got off a weak shot but then he decided to fall
    to the ice Then the fucking refVan Helloamend called the guy for
    holding  They replayed the play and my roomatewho is clueless about
    hockey wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player
    had both hands on his stick and no he did not trip him  It is simple
    Mario gets touched he falls to the ice automatic   But the thing that
    really pissed me off is Pitt scored the rd or th goal I don't remember
    on the resulting PP and
    eventually won   His divingcalls makes a HUGE difference in the
    outcome of a game

    They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking
    obvious That is not hockey  It allows inferior players to bring down the
level of the better players and allows inferior teams to beat better ones
This has pissed me off for many years now and it has improved somewhat
However during the playoffs and rd periods the damn refs must misplace
their balls because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got
any

    All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed

There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the
fans  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
more than names honouring personages

I think a compromise would work namely honouring personages in 
Conference names and using geographical references in the divisional 
names  Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the
game IMO it's a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners hope 
will have an effect  And it doesn't say much for the mentality of 
anybody it works on either  

Another thing that bothers me is the points system  Percentages as used in
the other major sports are clearly more informative  When I look at the
NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to
account for games in hand which is almost always the case  Some will
object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an Americanization
of the sport

Surprise I agree totally  The points system is fine if everybody at all
times has played the same number of games  Since this is almost never the
case winning percentage is the way to go  I don't particularly care if it 
is an American thing either if it works

Bleep Bleep Bleep  The Bruins lost AGAIN in OT  I can't stand it

Aside from frustrated ravings I must give Buffalo credit they are making good 
on most of their scoring opportunities and are playing great defense  Boston
players can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net
except for on rare occasions  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent
job clearing away rebounds  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed
but he's also getting plenty of help
Boston has been playing rather well better than would be indicated by the 
series score of  but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the 
game  As a result Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the st period
 goals down  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single
game the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite
bleak  IMHO the Bruins NEED to score first  If they can do that they have
an excellent chance of winning since they have outplayed the Sabres in the 
nd and rd periods

The scary thing is that I'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year
   I'll never cheer for the Sabres You can't convert me

winning  straight games in the playoffs was   Of course this doesn't

team along with beating the Rangers  straight a much stronger team has made
the act balanced out  That's about right  For Boston the odds of winning are
probably closer to  with weighted average since Buffalo's record isn't as
good and Boston has a stronger team  Enough about my QBA probabilities though
It's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE if you integrate that to Debbie

to be Blue If the team can rally around him maybe Moog can too

  Well I think whenever ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job But
   what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid
   baseball news which is not important at all Then I waited for the scores
   to comeon Sportscenter but they talk about Baseball basketball and 
   football Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid
   basketball Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that
   was like  sec I think they should give more attention to NHl during

   I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN Hope things improve

Wow this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team Boston
Which Sweeney you askwell of course Bob Sweeney the one that Boston
let Buffalo get a hold of they still have  Sweeneys which makes things
slightly confusing  Game winner in OT in game  and another
BIG goal seconds after Fuhr made  point blank saves  this is why
Grant has  rings to put Buffalo ahead in the rd  Yes Neely countered
a minute later but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being
tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities I
think Boston would have notched their first win of the series

Well the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet but
I certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want themactually
they've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt
that would come about  One more astronomical game by Fuhr a few more
heroics by the rest of the team this is a team sport afterall and I
think Borque Neely Jouneau sp and Company are gonna be swinging
a new stick Weather is perfect for golf season real soon  I'm not
gonna waiger anything on this because I've seen some really strange
things happen in both pro and college hockey

Talking about golfwas that a hockey swing golf swing or baseball
swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev
deflected in for the BIG ONE  The whole OT all  minute of it was a
tesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out
in the end something they weren't necessarily in the regular season  The
Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in
the opening seconds  I don't normally like penalties being called in
such ultracritical points but this was BLATENT  Finally the Sabres
won a faceoff they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game
when LaFontaine scooped at the puck  times  When Hawerchuck took his
shot quite a boomer but Blue stopped this one he took a few steps
over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again without setting
it up  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming
They score THEY SCORE  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping
up and down skating a little bit jumping some more and then skating
over to Brad May who he jumped on

Sabres  I recall a price tag of over  just for the paint job on
that mask and a total price of almost   Ouch  

Yeah it's the second one  And I believe that price too  I've been trying
to get a good look at it on the BruinSabre telecasts and wow does it ever
look good  Whoever did that paint job knew what they were doing  And given
Fuhr's play since he got it I bet the Bruins are wishing he didn't have it

While watching the PenguinsDevils game last night I saw the slash that
Barrasso took on the neck  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate  I think he was a Sabre but I'm not positive
Does anyone rememberknow his name  What has happened to him since  What
about the player whose skate cut the goalie  Name  Info  Has this ever
happened before in a hockey game   

Thanks

    I remember reading an article in Reader's digest many moons ago
 about a similar incident During a minor leaque game a player neck was
 cut when the opponent he was backchecking tripped and his skakes
 flew up In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since
 his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the
 usually instinctive reaction to protect his faceneck A quick        
 thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using
 snow to contract the blood vessels from what I can remember

Hi guys
        I'm looking to answe a bit of trivia  What hockeplayers have
appeared on major talk shows on TV ie Letterman CarsonLeno
Arsenio etcie shows of a national natureinclude Canadian equivalents
if you can think of any  This can include NHL Olympic and World Champion
ship players  I'm pretty sure I've seen Gretzky and Lemieux but I was
wondering if there were any others

I saw Messier and Leetch shooting at a camera on Letterman  I
could have been any show though since I watch NONE of those late
night shows very regularly

So this year you had a game on SCNY a game on SCA a game on ESPN
and if the Rangers hadn't crashed and burned you would have had a

I seem to recall last year everyone complaining about SC coverage  I
even remember Orioles' games being shown in the DC area instead of
hockey  And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other
games because its feature game was over  Sound familiar

This year I'm getting twice the coverage  I can see all the Caps
games plus the games ESPN shows  I think it's great that hockey is
back on ESPN  IMHO they're doing a great job especially considering
the baseball contract they have to work around

Felix Potvin deserves to have the sh kicked out of him  If there is anyone
that he should be hitting with his stick its his pussy defensemen who can't
seem to move big Dino Ciccerelli '  lbs out from in front of the net

Obviously Toronto has realized that they are overmatched by the Wings and must
rely on trying to antagonize the superior Red Wings with cheap shots  I prefer
to watch hockey than seeing shots of Felix Potvin slashing and spearing Dino
Ciccerelli standing in front of the net  HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO STAND IN
FRONT OF THE NET JUST NOT IN THE CREASE

Yes he does  BUT the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there  When
I played roller hockey boy do I miss those days as a goalie I would
scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot  I don't care if he's
in the crease or not get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball
Yes roller hockey remember  And if there was nobody around to clear
the slot then I'd do it myself by pushing the offending playerhard 
I hate people in my way when I'm the goalie and I am sure Felix does
too  I should say that I didn't see the incident so if Potvin really
swung the stick big time then that's not right but he can move people
out of the way  He's a player on the ice too you know

 That's not inner calm  It's boredom and it's being spoiled  The Arena's
 been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just
 take winning for granted  It's been seemingly forever since the team
 lost and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and
 surprise at victory

At least last night there was some excitement The Pens 
didn't have it wrapped up before the game was half over like 
the previous two games I'm not sure if NJ just rose up and 
played better or if the Penguins just started to play down 
somewhat Probably it was somewhere in between New Jersey 
seemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end They 
did much more swarming around which at least kept an 
element of suspense in the game No question that Billington 
helped make it more interesting also Claude Lemieux didn't 
help the cause any though with his ejection early in the 
game So who's going to start in the Devils goal for the 
final game Sunday  Sorry I couldn't help myself

 Bowman is the geniusJohnson isn't  Bowman is a great coachJohnson
 a very good one  However Bowman is really not a modern coach and
 Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days and
 delegate most of the daytoday responsibity to the assistants is
 a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part  

IMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at 
this time Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his 
group of players I would say we have been very lucky here in 
Pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one 
Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the 
change With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this 
year a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check Johnson on the 
other hand was able to inspire the younger inexperienced players 
to new heights Both coaches have  had different strengths Both 
of which came at exactly the right time 

Another person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach 
for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions How can 
you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway 
Playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also 
keeps the egos in check 

Just a couple of ideas

Hey man 

Having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a
couple of sessions of mock hockey I'm ready to invest in hockey
equipment particularly since I will be taking summer 'hockey
lessons'  However I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it
comes to hockey equipment  I've checked out local stores and looked
at catalogs but I was hoping to solicit opinionssuggestions before
actually plunking down any money  Having played football in high
school and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for
comparison  But for example what are the advantagesdisadvantages to
different kinds of shoulder pads and pantsgirdles  Are there any
notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles  etc  So any suggestions
or comments would be greatly appreciated

The problem is that by no fault of ESPN ongoing games are not
covered 'til the final horn sounds  With two channels SCNY and SCA
latefinishing games up to Pacific time and overtimes elsewhere will
kick in at the end of local coverage  If SCNY is blocked by the Mets
there is still some hockey on SCA SCNY Plus

With an ESPN  the current situation would be alleviated

	I said Gund will have to open his CHECKBOOK I didn't say give up
	any draft picks or promising talent  If we could have gotten
	Murphy for the M great but I agree the Sharks shouldn't give
	up young talent or early round draft picks  I listed Chelios et al
	only to indicate the TYPE of player I think the Sharks need to pick 
	up  The rules on signing free agents less than  years old puts
	a big restriction on what the Sharks can pick up  However I do
	believer they need to pick up some players who will add toughness
	to the team

But you have to remember that you're unlikely to get any real quality free
agents who do not require compensation  The Sharks tried with Makarov who
was probably the top of the class among noncompensation free agents but even
he probably wouldn't have helped too much

	Don't expect to get top quality just some toughness  I don't
	view Makarov as a player who would add toughness

Size hopefully won't be much of a worry next year  Alexander Cherbayev and
Michal Sykora have agreed to multiyear contracts and it appears that Mike
Rathje will also sign soon  All three are pretty big

	Size alone isn't enough  We all know how much fear Kolstad 
	struck in the eyes of opponents NOT

Well Rathje and Sykora are both highly touted prospects unlike Kolstad
And Cherbayev was initially supposed to play for the Russian WC Team  Anybody
know what happened there  That means that he's likely to be good enough


	Nelson you're confusing skill and toughness


McGillHammond  Johan Garpenlov  Would you really rather have those two
instead of Johan

	By your logic then you enjoy having Falloon and Ozolinsh on 
	injured reserve

By your logic then you think that if the Sharks had kept McGill and Hammond
that you can guarantee that Falloon and Ozolinsh wouldn't have gotten hurt
Think again there was a chance that McGill would have caused Ozolinsh to get
stuck at KC and as you know Hammond is worthless and McGill is almost
worthless

Well Wilson maybe but I don't think Falloon and Ozolinsh were really
injured on cheapshots

	who said they were   

If they weren't then I don't see any justification that having McGill and
Hammond around would prevent their injuries  If the injuries of Falloon and
Ozolinsh were purely accidental then what could McGill and Hammond have done
to prevent them

	Hey get off the McGillHammond thing  I'm no fan of either My
	point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing
	this year  This year we had more skill I'm all for that but
	if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they
	can't do you much good  Whether it's a cheap shot or not you
	can't let the other teams push you around  The  Sharks
	simply got pushed around to much  Other teams knew this
	They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not
	pay for it   Adding some players in the off season who will
	add some toughness to the team will help insure that next
	season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously 
	check our skill players or to take cheap shots  It doesn't
	guarantee no injuries nothing does but it's something the

According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN should the Islanders win tonite
the two teams will have the same record but the Devils will be playing the
Penguins  This is because the Islanders have won the season series against
the Devils  I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include

  season series
  goals against

in this order correct me if I'm wrong  Anyone have anything to add

 No no no  It's a squid  Keep the tradition alive  Kinda like the

Actually the way I understand it it is an octapus
Apparently a number of years ago a fan threw an octapus on
the ice and the announcer said Octapi will not occupy the ice
or something like that and it's happened ever since  The fans
cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands and
boo those who use a shovel

In response to a debate about who has has a better season Jagr of Francis

I think Jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time stats
don't exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better 


  Actually what I think has become more evident is that you are determined to
  flaunt your ignorance at all cost  Jagr did not have a better season than
  Francis  to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
  hockey knowledge  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
  plusminus  it is the most misleading hockey stat available

  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
  time per game and some measure of its quality ie is the player put out
  in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up
  against the other team's top one or two lines shorthanded etc I would
  much rather see the  disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
  merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications

 is a useful statistic  If a player is on the ice when his team scores a
lot of goals and only allows a few goals he must be doing something right
It is especially useful to compare between teammates as they play for the
same team and should have roughly similar  ratings if they are equally
good players  It can be adjusted with varying degrees of success to compare
between players on different teams

I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics but how useful
are the ones that you suggest  Total ice time would be very useful it is
a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before  Somehow measuring
the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless  It would be a
better stat for evaluating coaching ie are the players given quality ice
time actually their talented ones  A very good player could be given low
amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who
doesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of
quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that
thinks he is an effective player  This stat would be much more flawed than
 and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent

 is a useful stat  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent
You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see
that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed
is a very positive thing and should be evaluated as such

on him  If Dino gets his legs slashed can he slash Potvin
in return  This year at a UMLSSU hockey game a UM player
was called for a slash when he hit the goalie's glove with
his stick  Is that slashing while hitting someone's ankles
isn't  How do the refs know what to call  Do the goalies

 I'm looking to answer a bit of trivia  What hockeplayers have
 appeared on major talk shows on TV examples deleted
 I'm pretty sure I've seen Gretzky and Lemieux but I was
 wondering if there were any others

Michael J Fox was on Letterman about a year ago or two during the 
playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the Bruins  While he's not
exactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie's
legs or something like that in response to the Neely incident  It
was quite amusing as one of the few Letterman viewers who actually knew
what he was talking about  Anybody know who the Pens celebrity hockey
player is  Michael Douglas aka Michael Keaton

What sadist brought up this vein about Malarchuk  When I saw what
happened I wanted to throw up and at the same time I was devastated
since I thought that Malarchuk wouldn't survive  BTW I believe he picked
up an alcohol problem after before the incident

To radically change the subject the Caps must be having nightmares about
the Isles in overtime in the playoffs  Have they ever beaten the
Islanders in a playoff OT game  This is lunacy  The Caps are such a
sorry team in the playoffs they consistently choke against opponents who
they should be beating  Losing two OT games in a row is not coincidence
it's evidence of the choke factor

    Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey  All that fucker has to do is fall
    on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least   Last night in the
    rd game between NJ and Pitt he was being pushed while skating across the
    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off  The guy on him was
    doing a good job so he got off a weak shot but then he decided to fall
    to the ice Then the fucking refVan Helloamend called the guy for
    holding  They replayed the play and my roomatewho is clueless about
    hockey wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player
    had both hands on his stick and no he did not trip him  It is simple
    Mario gets touched he falls to the ice automatic   But the thing that
    really pissed me off is Pitt scored the rd or th goal I don't remember
    on the resulting PP and
    eventually won   His divingcalls makes a HUGE difference in the
    outcome of a game

    All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed

    Steve





We must have been watching two different games   The Devil had one hand on
Mario's elbow and pulling the elbow caused Mario to fall so the call was
appropriate

Using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesn't give me a lot of
confidence in your call either  Next time consider getting a second opinion
from a clueful observer  Or maybe all those available disagreed

I for one am happy about the Ranger's hiring of Keenan  It's too bad that they


I agree that Keenan is an excellent choice  Did you see Mike
Lupica's column in Sunday's news  My sentiments exactly  I
think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire
into their hearts next season  Either that or he's going to 
be kicking alot of butt

Reading through most of these hockey news I don't see many Ranger fans writing   

I'm here but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly
quiet you know doing the lurking thing  I don't have a
sense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either  I 
am a diehard Ranger fan I guess I have to be  I sat in the
Garden throughout the Penguins'  led by Mario's  goals  decimation 
of them on  but am sick at the abundance of talent that has
been totally untapped and the lack of heart displayed this
season


I have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that last
dreadful stretch

 Knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didn't we see Mike
Hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when Leetch first went
down


Hurlbut was injured for quite a while  I'm not sure but I
think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run and
if so like you question why he wasn't used


 Why is Joe Kocur playing every night  He is not Bob Probert who is
tough but also can play


I believe Kocur was used in many instances for his intimidation 
factor  Granted he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for 
that reason alone but you have to realize that when a team is
not doing any REAL physical intimidation I'd like to have a nickel 
for every time JD said 'They've got to take the body more' 
you've got to at least have some illusions 

 How come Paul Broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of the
season  At least he plays with some heart and character draws penalties and
plays  when he's on the ice  Was he in the doghouse for some reason

I agree and I don't know

 Joe Cirella  Enough said


Sorry I don't agree with you here  I think Joey C did a good
job filling in when he was asked to  I can't imagine that it's
easy going from near  ice time to being a full timer  I don't
seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too
much or failing to clear the zone  He worked hard and at
least didn't make any rookie mistakes  As he said himself in an
interview he can only give what he has  and he did  


Ranger fans may be suffering but we're some of the most loyal unlike Islander
fans who only show up when the team wins


Absolutely  I think attendance at the Garden was better on the
last day of the season than any average night for the
Islanders

 
fought series  Mario is amazing


The man is awesome  In a way I'm enjoying the playoffs more
now that the Rangers aren't in them  I can really appreciate
all the glory Mario is getting without 'hating' him because he's
on the opposing team  He deserves it all as far as I'm
concerned

As if an aluminum stick being taken to Ulf's head is gonna solve the problem
with violence in the sport of hockey  How the hell can you say the guy is
a goon and justify it with your backassward mentality  Saying that hurting
a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine  New rules and a new 
referee system need to be instituted  Right now too many of the real goons
get away with too much because the ref is watching the play or supposed to beI've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond to name a few with their heads up their  asses on a few calls rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the 
play  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties it would be an
improvement

Unfortunately that is the way the league is heading You can't fight
so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when
the ref isn't looking Ulf has brought this to a high level Players
stuck in the past like Neely who prefer fights to cheap shots
are at a disadvantage in the new system

Lets face it A cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective
method It is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of
causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way I don't
like it but that's the way the league is going

By the way there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last PenguinDevil
game Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick Must have been a
legal hit After all Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do
things like that

I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton
Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference
next week While the exact details are not known it is believed
to concern the Oiler's future

Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement
with Copps Collesium in Hamilton During the press conference
Pocklington may announce the deal It is quite possible that
the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to
renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium

Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for  million earlier
but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington

As for me my opinion is divided Edmonton has been fairly
supportive of the Oilers Even though they're a small market
team they had many sellouts in the s Even with the problems
that the team had this year they still brought in more fans
than many teams in larger cities did On the other hand if
the team does move there is no place more deserving than
Hamilton Of course how would that affect the grand
realignment scheme of Bettman

Clement although he has a pleasant personality aggravatingly pleasant
in my opinion is a terrible
analyst because he is almost alway wrongthe prototypical example
being New Jersey's first goal last Sunday
 
I grew up with Dick Irvin doing color beside Danny GallivanI knew
did Irvin Dick Irvin was a friend of mineBill Clement you aren't
any Dick Irvin
 
As long as the teams involved do not include the US national team or
the New York Rangers I'd take John Davidson over Bill Clement any
day

Personality means something to me  That is exactly why I like Clement
and Emrick  On the other hand JD is a pompous bullheaded arrogant
knowitall  He's a real turnoff which is exactly what I do when he's
on  One complaint I do have about Clement is that he sometimes talks
too much  If I wanted that I'd listen to Tim McGarver doing a baseball
game

All of these Czechs Kadlec Dolezal not anymore are very good hockey
players It is a big surprise that Hlinka selected Dolezal 
Dole had a bad season in JyPHT and that's why they didn't make
a new contract The other Czech we had Jiri Jonak got fired also

There are lots of Czechs playing in Finland Darius Rusnak Igor Liba

I watched the game GermanyCzechs in WC todayand i was astonished about
the behaviour of the German audience
The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went
grazy They threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis
that stupid or what I guess the Canadian referee one of the
Isostarbros  gave the German team a penalty for that but it didn't help
much
I guess the Germans just are proud over their NaziKill'emAllEveryone
ButUsGermansSucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude
in every possible sport remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer
It really pisses me off
I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks but 
most of them seem to do

    I have some advice for you and some thoughts about
your hatred of the Minnesota North Stars

 A real team like Toronto would not be moved you are right
   just eliminated from the playoffs first round
 Why stay in Minnesota when you can go to a college in
   Western Ontario and actually take classes on mapreading
   and the Artistry of BSing specifically set up for just you
 Why should anyone love the Stars when hating the Leafs
   is so much better
 Oh I'm sorry well maybe you can't understand my
   big words next time I'll limit my vocabulary to words
   like get real team now and do not waste our time
 Respond to this article I love to laugh at your humor
   even though it it unintentional I got a BIG kick out of
   GO LEAFS GO go where HOME I think

The score is now  The Pens are beating the shit out of the Devils who
gave up in the middle of the nd period ESPN does something smart The
announcer states well folks this game is getting out of hand Lets go to
the IslanderCapitals game I celebrate as I was actually making progress in
my CS homework because I was so bored by the scheduled game  I tear down and
throw on my jersey Hunter scores I go ape shit 'cause this is the first
caps game I've been able to watch all season And what does ESPN do they
go back to the blowout that NJ hasn't a chance in hell of winning
     The period ends and the sportscaster CAPITOLS JUST TIED IT UP YES
oops excuse me  goes into his penguin worship mode Dont freak pens fans
They are worthy of this I'm so glad we wont have to play them as much next
year and here comes the rd periodwhat its the blowout again Oh they
were just waiting for the CapIsles to get out of intermission Good
they've put a close game back on Wait WHATS THIS SHIT THEY'RE SHOWING
THE BLOWOUT AGAIN


AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

Oh guess what the score is now  penguins Switch games you 

Holy shit they're changing games ITS ABOUT GODDAMNED TIME Lets see if
they'll stay

Later

I think this proves by  point The Caps game goes into overtime but
due to contractual obligations they have to switch to the fucking baseball
Sorry for my language but im PISSED What the hell were they going to do
if their scheduled game went into overtime ESPN get your head out of your
ass

Now I know there are a lot 



 First of all I think when ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job but
 last night I felt the same way I really hate watching DevilsPens game 
 Everyone knows that Devils are going to get their ass kicked why even 
 bother showing them I was so bored and these ESPN people don't seem to have
 any brain After the Sundays and last night games they are still going to 
 show DevilsPens on THU and SUN WHat the hell are they thinking about I 
 think if they keep it up like this NHL will never get a major network contract
 I'd rather see CapsIsls game which is more exciting 

 Now I just hope all baseball games are rained out on ESPN so atleast
 we can get diffrent hockey games

In other TV news the Penguins announced yesterday that they will have 
fewer broadcast TV games and will have  games on some sort of
subscription  payperview system Yuck
 
This is incorrect  This year the Pens had  games on free TV and 
games on PPV  Next year they will have  games on free TV and  on 
a subscription basis  
 
You actually get  more free game than last year and there will be no
more radioonly games

Yes you're right After going home and reading the paper I got the
full details That's what I get for making a post based on WDUQ's news
I should know by now they get just about every sports related item wrong

     As a person who has rarely even SEEN Don Cherry and doesn't know
anything about him I don't know whether it is just this area
Pittsburgh of the USA that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether
he's a Canadian thing altogether  Seriously what is he all about  I
know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him
SOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question
is what is the deal with him  Secondly are the comments of his that I
read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him
seriously  I gotta tell you from what I see he really sounds like an
ass  Let me know  maybe I'm missing something

	I loved the ABC coverage The production was excellent The appearance
Antonioyou weren't alone

ABC ratings were very good I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast
was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend National
rating came out to a very respectable  Top Nielsen markets were
at  In Bostonthe game scored lower at  but it had some competion
from local sports teams
Quite frankly I expected ABC's ratings to be under  But I'm happy
to be proven wrong

WellwellSometimes it pays off clicking away on your cabletv remote
control And if you happen to be a hockey fanyou could just stumble
upon a playoff hockey game

ESPN picked up DetroitToronto game on Monday night because the only
night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago You have to give
ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX coverage and having Bill
Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV stationWATE for intermission analysis
MaybeESPN people were giddy over perliminary overnight ABC ratings
for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the
Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion
Good moveESPN

Various justifiable rantings on ESPN coverage by several deleted


The only way to change ESPN's thinking if it is even possible is to complain
to them directly  Anyone know there telephone  in Bristol Ct  

I do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn't think viewers will simply
change the channel from a boring gameI know I did  And then when
they didn't show the NYIWash overtimes I was livid  If I wanted
to watch baseball I could have turned on the PhilliesPadres extra
inning gameinstead I went to bed angryI boycotted ESPN's
morning Sportscenter today I was still so incensed

My wife says I shouldn't go to bed angry but last niteGRRRRRRR

where ESPN is coming from ESPN is committed to a single telecast a night

Cup contenders eight times a year while Detroit got to play such 
powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota  Now Edmonton is hardly even a force
in the league and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks while

Them thar's fighting wordshardly a forcegeezmiss the playoffs
once in  years and even after making the final four  times in the
last five years and everyone thinks its doomsville

over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving so was 
everybody in the Norris except St Louis  Detroit had to improve just
to keep up with the competition in their division  They had to improve a
lot to get better than their competition in the Norris

Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent  For really good
players they had Yzerman Burr and Probert and that was about it  And
no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good The
rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans  The only reason
they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the
coaching of Demers who at least at first got every last ounce of effort
possible out of his team  Then even his coaching began to degrade


Fedorov Primeau Kozlov Lidstrom Sillinger Konstantinov Drake
Kennedy Racine and Cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to
DevellanoMurray inherited these guysin addition to Yzerman
Probert Carson Chiasson etc

There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings
wise when Murray took over as Vanc was when Quinn took over some of which
I outlined above but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with
at the outset than did Quinn with the exception of Yzerman  And one player
cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender as I'm sure everyone
reading this will agree  


NoQuinn had far lessMurray took over Detroit at a time to 
take advantage of all of Devellano's good draftingif Devellano
had not given in to Demers request to make the Oates trade he might
still be GM

It was great to hear that UMass is bringing back hockey  It reminded me that a
couple of years ago there was talk that both Bimidgi sp and Mankato State
trying to upgrade their programs to Div  status  I also seem to remember
that they had some trouble with new NCAA rule about just who was allowed to
compete at the Div  level  Was that ever resolved  Also I was just
wondering if there is ANY college hockey east of Colorado Alaska excepted
With the new popularity of hockey on the west coast I would expect there to
be some interest building at the collegiate levels too Anyone heard anything

I don't think trading Kisio was intrinsically a mistake however trading him
for a rd round pick would be he should have been worth a lot more than a
rd round pick for a playoff team  In fact I would intimate that the offers
the Sharks got this year for Kisio were way greater than just a rd round pick

Hindsight's  Nobody expected Kisio to have his nd best career year

Besides without Kisio the Sharks would have tanked even earlier in
the season and Gund might have gotten a little more serious
about getting Joe Murphy a guy who definitely would be around
   years from now when the Sharks do make the playoffs

What else could be done  The Gunds offered  million for Murphy but the
Oilers wanted prospects which the Sharks declined to give which I think is
correct

I didn't mean to imply that Gund's offer wasn't enough  Gund's offer
was the right  but too late in the season  M offered in November
lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy this season and make the
playoffs this year M in March doesn't help Sather with his
immediate objectives doesn't help with long term objectives only a
prospect or draft pick does and no way should the Sharks do that
However getting back to whatif games had Kisio been traded to
Chicago last year then the Sharks go  for October and maybe Gund
panicks sooner in November And here's another whatif twist Chicago
would have had Kisio this season they never go after Murphy in the
first place because Kelly is having his best season bigger guys in
Chicago So Gund has no competition So Ferriera Sather and Keenan
all look like geniuses

A broken fax machine and Ferriera Keenan and maybe Kingston
and maybe even Green lose their jobs Kind of makes you
shiver doesn't it 

Bottomline for every black scenario any of you can concoct for
Kisio leaving I can concoct an equally bright one

If the Kisiofiasco was the cause of Ferierra's down fall I hope
it wasn't because he tried to trade Kisio but because he screwed it
up Nonetheless I'm sorry Ferierra and Kingston are gone and I wish Gund
would follow

And what have the Gunds done exactly that caused you to wish that they were
gone 

Are you serious
	 Let Ferierra go
	 fire Kingston these last two basically mean that
		Sharks are starting over again in terms of the
		timetable to capture the Cup As I've stated
		frequently  out  expansion teams had the same GM
		from inception through Cup season

	 broadcast more home games than away games
	 broadcast very few road Pacific and Mountain time games
	 jack up my ticket prices from  to  in two years not that I'm
		going to pay  bucks for  seats I'll probably next to the
		virtual  folks

	 not tell me my priority 
	 not let me sell my priority 
	 in order for me to get the free jacket force me to order my tickets
		for next season before I get to select my section

	 not let me park at the new arena after paying for their
		privileged parking lot which was sometimes full when
		I got there for  straight years

I've been a loyal ticket holder since day  literally in spring of
' when the team was announced  and I'm not getting that loyalty
returned Wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison And
Pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all

GO EDMONTON OILERS  Go for playoffs next year  Stay in Edmonton

I know one isn't suppose to make negative comments on signatures but
what did us Oiler fans do to you to deserve the Stay in Edmonton
part I'd never wish the Kings to leave metroLA it's too much fun

 Well here in Detroit we get to see and hear Don Cherry quite regularly
The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC ch  in
Windsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods We
also get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game The
Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach
about what else Hockey  It's actually a pretty good show and Don
isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner  I think this is were
Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure  Don use to coach the
Boston Bruins  I don't know exactly when that was  Could someone fill
me in on this info
  A local radio station here in Detroit WLLZ talks to Don every Tuesday
morning  Personally I've had my fill of Donny  He really pisses me off
sometimes  During the DetroitToronto game Monday night on CBC Don gave
high praise to Doug Gilmour saying he was a twoway player and not
just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player
in the game because of that  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour
is a good twoway player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman
about a month ago on a local radio talk show  What gives
  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from
city to city
  Don Cherry  'I think insert star player name for city that he is in
              is the best twoway player in the league today'
 
  There have been other times can't remember exactly what he said that he
basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to
  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario
Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs
from the Civic Center Yes I think the Pens will make it out of the
Wales Conference Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about
Lemieux  In my opinion he is an ass  And I won't change my opinion
if I'm in a different city
  Sorry if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get
this off my chest

I knew despite the lack of a full game telecast last week it was still
too much hockey for Atlanta Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any
playoff games till May And even when they show the games on MAy and May
they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast I know this
is still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia Alabama etc but
it is still pretty annoying At least in PIttsburgh we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate


I asked them what their problem was I told them that a local  rating was
not that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time
without much promotion Besides their syndicated programming in the afternoon
is usually low rated So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs
She told me that they had contractual obligations I asked her if golf
was shown oin ABC would contractual obligations come in the way And how come
contractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast She
then couldn't give me a coherent answer


Also I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game
attendances and that the demographics were good I think ABC and other networks
should begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with
 thier sports programming
I hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB  and complain
bitterlyt about this Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts
since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation

The lady did not seem to settle on a single reason Sometimes the reason
is low ratings Then another time she says contractual obligations

For those of you who complain about Don Cherry and wonder why he is
popular

the reply is Dick Vitale and John Madden and Bobby Knight and
Joe Garagiola and Howard Cosell

John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his AllMadden team
a lot over much better receiversfor much the same reasons Cherry
sings the praises of Doug Gilmoura little guy with heartyet one
doesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has
lost his marbles

Dick Vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or
that college with outrageous statements

Why should Americans expect that Canada would not have such characters
in relation to our greatest passionwhich is hockey   Canadians
are very similar to Americansculturally our sports are just hockey
and curling whereas with Americans it is footballbasketballbaseball
and bowling

However Bowman is really not a modern coach and
Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days and
delegate most of the daytoday responsibity to the assistants is
a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part  

I would argue Gerald that Bowman is the first modern coach
Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weightroom
in the s  He is the first coach I have seen that manipulates
the press into spreading false game plan rumours  During important games
listen to the pregame interview will Bowman and compare that to
what is on the ice  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups 
Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free 
in OT  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was
trademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach

I am left asking What is a modern coach if not Bowman

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the NHL
WE WAS ROBBED

No  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost and Ron Hextall is the
reason Quebec won 

I don't buy this at all Roy was the reason the game was tied and that
would not have been the case had Dionne kept his cool 
Roy stood on his 
head for the first  minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from 
endtoend Kamensky's minibreak after the tying goal and the first shot by 
Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy Roy outplayed 
Hextall for most of the game but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall 
the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities

Whoa  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays
really well he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time  Ths
is not so  Roy is the 'villain' as you so succinctly put it because he
allowed a very cheap goal  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall perhaps you
should get a tape of the game and watch the first  minutes of the third
period  NHL goaltenders make some great saves  If they did not they
would not be in the NHL in the first place  I do not expect any particular
goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time even though they
are occasionally required  However when it comes to a routine shot like
Sakic's especially at such a crucial time in a game I don't think there 
are any legitimate excuses 

Hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces 
description of lucky bounces
Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays  

I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant  I am arguing is that a
relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result 
in a goal 

  but it was just the  goal The timing stank but against
an explosive team like Quebec they gave them  opportunity too many with
a powerplay that was totally unnecessary

In a onegoal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as
'just the  goal'  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty
eitherin fact I think it was a boneheaded move  But it led to one goal
only and Montreal had a two goal lead  My main concern is the second 
goal

This most certainly was a team loss Leclair missed his opportunities
as did Bellows and Brunet Dionne took a bad penalty Damphousse and Lebeau
were silent Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night Roy gave
up the bad goal Roy by no means can be singled out for this loss

What you say about the skaters is absolutely true  But realize that the 
game was effectively won  You could watch any hockey game in fact you
could watch any sporting event period and spend hours discussing the 'what
if's' wrt missed opportunities  They are not important when the final
result is decided  If I get the time soon I'll watch the game again and
email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive
screwups  Montreal was leading with a minute to go  The goalie
is the last line of defence and I will grant that extra attention is
focussed on him sometimes without justification  But Roy gave up a lousy
goal and a team cannot afford such a goal

Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot

And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal Please 

WHO CARES  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally
unrelated lousy play  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like  But if
you're going to assess his performance keep in mind that he made the key
saves at the key times

Roy is paid big money because
that is his value compared to other goalies  and he still is in the top 

For the record I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in
the league  In fact I agree that he is

The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
comments against the Habs They are no better than uninformed fans
                            
I assume you are referring to me  However I have pointed out that I think
the loss can be blamed on Roy  I have not said he sucks nor do I think I've
made any other 'derogatory comments'  If you regard objective
and informed FYI observations as derogatory I really can't help you

Pure and Simple Grant Fuhr is money  He has been awesome in the playoffs
especially last night  But Mogilny has been scoring well and his russian
friend Kymlev sp has also done well  But Fuhr is the biggest reason they
are winning and the difference between this year's team and previous years

 Unfortunately that is the way the league is heading You can't fight
 so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when
 the ref isn't looking Ulf has brought this to a high level Players
 stuck in the past like Neely who prefer fights to cheap shots
 are at a disadvantage in the new system

 Lets face it A cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective
 method It is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of
 causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way I don't
 like it but that's the way the league is going

 By the way there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last PenguinDevil
 game Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick Must have been a
 legal hit After all Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do
 things like that

Are there any ex NHL hockey players out there who might care to
comment on this and end this ridiculously long discussion

There have been to many fn complainers about this game that it's making me
sick

Generally I agree with you However  last night ESPN cut away to Baseball
Tonite which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball and they cut
away at  pacific That's quite a contract they have there  if
ESPN couldn't deliver they should have had a transistion plan to
let SportsChannel pick up the slack

Nonetheless it is ultimately the fault of the USAmerican public that regular
season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the US
Support your team support your game

Somebody in rsh had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler
to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would
consider their products Here's an equally excellent idea watch
baseball for  minutes I know I'm asking a lot but that's what spew
bags are for write down who is advertising and write them letters
complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and
that you won't consider buying their products because of it

Just some thoughts

I don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player
but this time I couldn't resist  During the PensDevils game
last night second period I think Kevin Stevens was in the
penalty box Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face
then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend
himself  All Kjell could do at ' and  pounds was laugh

And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen Ulf is getting a
little out of hand lately  His cheap shots are getting more
frequent and more violent  As everybody in the Meadowlands
except for the officials could see last night he rammed the
butt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat  I've always
supported the argument he does his job by being irritating
but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO  Of course
Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either
It seems that he was following the The only way to beat the
Penguins is to injure them philosophy

As my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day
Jagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night and last night as
well although the  seconds he danced around the Devils end
was pretty exciting

I fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team
left in Pittsburgh will be the Steelers

Perish the thoughtbut you know you may be right at least as far
as MAJOR LEAGUE professional sports teams go  They all seem to be
becoming BIG MONEY games much more so than at any previous time  To
think that if I am ever able to move back home several years from now
all that may be there is an AHL team at bestSIGH

The interesting thing is that the NHL is also expanding at the same
time as it is dramatically increasing the amount of money needed to
operate a team  This would seem to indicate that there's a BIG
shakeout about to occur in the next few years unless player salaries
can somehow be brought under control  Frankly I don't see how the
NHL's current drive for expansion is supportable under its current
operating conditions  If revenue sharing AND a salary cap don't come
into the NHL soon look out

Hopefully EPSN will use the lesson given by the master Ted Turner
The season Ted introduced TNT many cable co's refused to put it on
saying that gee we get enough old movies miniseries etc on TBS
USA AMC WGN WOR why do we need another one This was in the fall
Come spring Ted fixed their little red wagons good The previous
spring NBA playoffs wore on TBS now they were on TNT and still are
And everyone gets TNT now

So ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN and leave
hockey on ESPN And if cable co's play games and drop ESPN
in favor of ESPN ESPN should alternate baseball and football between
channels every week

But do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy

ESPN is pathetic I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage
and I agree with all of you  Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up
over nothing  We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck  I mean have
you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey It
sucks I mean really sucks  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the
ass  I was really pissed of about last night coverage  I go to school in Ohio
I know the Indians suck so why show them  If I were Bill Clement I would
shoot myself

Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show
overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going
to happen in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even
the boring Devils game

Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly
belive that they have know respect for the fans ie because of contract       
obligations screw you ESPN

Praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit

  And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded 
  resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other

 CYT  Wasn't Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to
 CYT  Pittsburgh

 CYT And Rick Tochett was the captain of the Flyers when traded to the Pens
 CYT recently

 CYT Caleb

 CYT And let us not forget that the New Jersey Devils traded
 CYT captain Kirk Muller for Stephen Richer and Chorske

 CYT Man I hated that trade


        Well as for team captains being traded
        in there first year in the NHL the
        Edmonton Oilers traded their captain
        Ron Chiperfield to the Quebec Nordique
        right at the trading deadline for 
        Goaltender Ron Lowe
        In their second year of existence
        The Edmonton Oilers again right at the trade 
        deadline traded their captain this time 
        BJ McDonald to the Vancouver Canucks
        along with the rights to winger Ken 
        Berry for Garry Lariviere and the rights 
        to Lars Gunner Petterson 
        
        as for more captain trivia the next Edmonton
        captain was Lee Fogilin who was later traded to
        the Buffalo Sabres after him was Wayne Gretzky
        who was traded to L A then came Kevin Low who
        only this year was traded to the N Y Rangers
        so that every captain the Edmonton Oilers have had
        has been traded

        The present captain is Craig McTavish and we'll
        just have to wait and see


        well talk to you later

the fools at WEEI are owned by the Celtics and thus will show them over the

Way back in the early years 's it took  wins to garner the Stanley Cup 
Soooooo a couple of local fish mongers local to the Joe Louis Arena that is
started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win  After
each victory one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the
ice  They are dead by the way  It was a brilliant marketing strategy to
shore up the demand for one of their least popular products

Hope this helps

ESPN is pathetic I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage
and I agree with all of you  Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up
over nothing  We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck  I mean have
you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey It
sucks I mean really sucks  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the
ass  I was really pissed of about last night coverage  I go to school in Ohio
I know the Indians suck so why show them  If I were Bill Clement I would
shoot myself

I hope this makes you feel better but the overtime between the Isles and
the Caps was GREAT

Can the Sabres win two more games against the Bruins

I think game three in Buffalo will be the most important of the
series  If the Sabres lose that game the party will be over  It will 
be hello next year

The key for the remaining games in the series will be whether Fuhr can
keep up his brillliant goaltending and if Mogilny can continue skate by 
the Bruins  He has shown demonstrated excellent speed

Finally the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season

  Buffalo is up  is the series with Boston and the reasonGrant Fuhr 
  Fuhr is playoff hungry and he's proving once again why they call him
  money goaltender Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the
  league anymore Statistically at least but he's proving that he can
  make the big save at the right time
  
  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr and probably would have had a chance 
  against powerhouse Detroit But againwhere was Andreychoke in game  

  I can see the huge smile on Gerald's face after Fuhr's performance

Does anyone recieve annoying email from Roger Maynard whenever they post an
article telling them to leave him alon and stop posting to the group
These emails are filled with insults more than are usual in Roger's posts
and have little if any hockey info
I have recieved two in the last  days
I am just wondering if I am special or Roger trys to bully everyone who
disagrees with him

Obligatory hockey comment

It is highly unlikely that the Maple Leafs will even get out of their
division

Hooray I hear on TSN that the Jets have won a game Selanne
getting a hattrick

Of course here in GOD'S COUNTRY read Ontario I couldn't
see that game nor any other in the VANWPG series so far
because our beloved CBC figures no one out here cares about
this series which has looked pretty competitve so far

On Monday and Wednesday nights CBC could have shown the Toronto
Detroit game done the news then picked up WinnipegVancouver
They didn't  Tonight  You guessed it TorontoDetroit the
news not the end of the Jets game then CalgaryLA

SO if it's Hockey Night in Canada why can't this Ontarian see
one of the two series with two Canadian teams  Is this too much to
ask

Teemu Selanne had  goals Keith Tkachuk had one and Luciano Borsato
scored a rare Jets shorthanded goal as the Jets held on to beat the
Canucks  and close the series to   Trevor Linden and Pavel
Bure had two goals each for the Canucks in a losing cause

Selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump scoring two powerplay
goals and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon

Hard work paid off tonight for the Jets and if the Jets continue to
exhibit this strong work effort they can make a series of it I woofed
last year when we were up I ain't going to do THAT again  I'll
have to be quietly happy with a solid performance

the two teams will have the same record but the Devils will be playing the
Penguins  This is because the Islanders have won the season series against
the Devils  I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include

I'd say it's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism The closest

doesn't

ST         as for more captain trivia the next Edmonton
ST         catain was Lee Fogilin who was later traded to
ST         the Buffalo Sabres after him was Wayne Gretzky
ST         who w   traded to L A then came Kevin Low who
ST         nly this year was traded to the N Y Rangers
 
Wasn't Mark Messier Captain of the oilers before Kevin Lowe
But of course he was traded as well  so your point of every
Oilers captain being traded is still true

so all us hockeyautomobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand
	ESPN delays the martinsville race by a day for the NFL draft
	ESPN shows baseball instead of the overtime of a NHL playoff game

	gimme a break guys

  Does anyone know why this race is tape delay Especially until Monday
  Is this the weekend for the NFL draft
  If so postponing the race for a day is
  a real slap in the face for racing fans
  I'm afraid you're right as usual As I recall they've been doing this
  ever since they started covering the draft live I wish they could work
  out some kind of a deal with somebody else such as TNN to get the race
  on live but I guess ESPN isn't much into sharing It also clarifies
  where auto racing stands on their priority list as if we didn't already
  know

Well well they don't like our defenders mainly Lumme and Numminen

About  is correct for Numminen and Lumme


 RTeemu Selanne
 
Compared to Kurri Selanne's points are too high lets make it  or 

No Kurri's points are too low  for Kurri and  for Selnne

 well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of
 Markus Ketterer the goalie  or the players listed above and luck There's
 presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at
 the highest level but still valuable role players however My guess would be
 that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a  team in the NHL

Wow now it looks like you don't like our players What about guys like
Nieminen Jutila Riihijarvi Varvio Laukkanen Makela Keskinen and even
if he is aging Ruotsalainen The main difference between finnish and North
American players is that our players tend to be better in the larger rink
The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe 
And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck though
they helped I think that the main reason was that the team worked well
together


That's true Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL Northame
ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks An average
european player from Sweden Finland Russian or TsechSlovakia is a better 
skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague Especially defenders in NHL
are mainly slow and clumsy Selnne has also said that in the Finnish Smleague
game is more based on skill than in NHL In Finland he couldn't get so many 
breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in
NHL Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Selnne's speed accentuates because
of clumsy defensemen

I have to admit that the best players come from Canada but those regulars
aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues Also top europeans
are in the same level as the best northamericansexcept Lemieux is in the
class of his own

Interestingly Keenan's cocoach or is it his Number One on Team
Canada at the World Championships is Roger Neilsen  


But ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day
Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the
initiative within the limits of his systemwhile Roger
has a reactive hockey philosophywhich is why Messier will
be able to and has played for Keenan but thought Roger's way
was a sure loser

It'd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsen's
contract to be Keenan's assistant   Roger did do a very good job
with the mediocre players just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks
of  years ago  but his mistake was playing the Rangers like those
Canucks last May 


Roger is a great assistant coachbut considering what must be bad
blood between Nielson and Messier it would be a mistake to bring
him back even in that role

Losers like us You are the fucking moron who has never heard of the Western
Business School or the University of Western Ontario for that matter Why 
don't you pull your head out of your asshole and smell something other than
shit for once so you can look on a map to see where UWO is Back to hockey
the North Stars should be moved because for the past few years they have
just been SHIT A real team like Toronto would never be moved

Not only have I not heard of the Western Business School or the University
of Western Ontario I've never even wondered if there WAS a western
Ontario  And judging by the quality of the posts coming from there I'm
still not sure that the place exists

Perhaps I should be impressed though since it appears that grade school
children in that area have access to the Internet

     As a person who has rarely even SEEN Don Cherry and doesn't know
anything about him I don't know whether it is just this area
Pittsburgh of the USA that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether
he's a Canadian thing altogether  Seriously what is he all about  I
know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him
SOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question
is what is the deal with him  Secondly are the comments of his that I
read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him
seriously  I gotta tell you from what I see he really sounds like an
ass  Let me know  maybe I'm missing something

From his Topps rookie year as coach card 
For the past couple of seasons Don has been the highlysuccessful
 coach of the Rochester Americans of the AHL but he is getting his
 first shot at an NHL job with the Bruins  Named Coach of the Year
 in the AHL the last two years and he aims to make the Bruins a
 rough team again as they were a couple of years back  Although
 he played  seasons of professional hockey Don never played a
 regularseason NHL game  He did appear in one playoff game for
 Boston in   Don's brother Dick played two seasons in the
 NHL with Boston and Philadelphia

 I watched the game GermanyCzechs in WC todayand i was astonished about
 the behaviour of the German audience
 The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went

It was not just those penalties Most of all it was the penalty the referee didn't
call on the Czechs right before their first goal

 grazy They threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis
 that stupid or what I guess the Canadian referee one of the
 Isostarbros  gave the German team a penalty for that but it didn't help
 much
 I guess the Germans just are proud over their NaziKill'emAllEveryone

Don't you think it's quite silly to call it a Nazi attitude when some people 
throw coins on the ice Hey I don't approve the behavior of these guys
especially not in a WC game but I can't see any reason for using the word 'Nazi'
in this connection 
  
 ButUsGermansSucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude
 in every possible sport remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer

Soccer hooligans are not just a German problem remember the world cup in Italy
Again there's a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shopwindows
or fighting with other socalled 'fans' who come to a WC just to see if the
Dutch or the English or the Germans are the best bruisers
Which other sports are you talking about I don't think soccer is 'every possible
sport'

 It really pisses me off
 I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks but 
 most of them seem to do

How many Germans do you know Do you think  out of  is 'most of them' 
If you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the US what do you
think about the Americans 'Most of them' like beating blacks

 I'd like to see some playoff games since I'm stuck in Buffalo at UB but
I think Boston isn't giving up so easy

No Boston probably won't go down easy but if the Sabres hadn't won
game one Buffalo would have been out in four

And what problem are you having with playoff games here in
Buffalo There's the SabresBruins QuebecMontreal and
whatever ESPN and ABC show and on opposite nights there's

Is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad  I
can't remember how many times during the PenguinsDevils game they showed some
guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being
fired on goal  In fact I think they even missed one goal completely because
they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner

Now the last time I watched a football game they didn't show the lineman going
at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown     

Is it just me

 	DODY WOOD		Season st
 Acquired	rd round pick in  entry draft
 Grade		I DD although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all
 
 I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much
 
 You Nah 
 
 He was seriously unimpressive even as a tough guy his rep However as
 few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless I hate
 to judge the talent too quickly Butn in Dody's case Im tempted to make an
 exception
 
 But I won't

Wood played most of his junior career in Seattle  He was one
of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
  He rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
the WHL

However I was extremely surprised when he was drafted especially in
the third round  He certainly didn't look like NHL material

	Okay here's some gripeing griping whatever

	I live in Santa Barbara for reference I think

	Okay ABC showed the KingsFlames fine YAWN

	ESPN through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the
  Red WingsToronto game cool

	But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that
  ESPN would show PittNJ on Tuesday and BosBuff on Thursday

	I raced home from work early  Pacific to catch the game but
  ALAS it was the BostonBuffalo game and then they promised that they would
  show the PittNJ game on Thursday  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind

	I didn't mind THAT MUCH  I watched the game hockey is MUCH better
  than NO hockey  During the game their were no video highlights from the
  Patrick division  What the hell was going on  At least they should show
  video highlights of the other games especially the NYICaps game that was
  so close  My father lives in Bowling Green Kentucky Bumbfck Egypt
  got to watch the Pens game on ESPN  I just don't get it

	The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didn't want
  to see the PittsburghNew Jersey game  will turn on their TVs on Thursday
  and see the PittsburghNew Jersey game  instead of the BuffaloBoston game
    At least in my case I just had to wait  more days to see my game

	If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on
  Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN I'd be mad as
  hell

	Oh well hopefully we'll get better coverage next year OR
  SOMETHING

Matt Coohill

PS  The announcers for the BuffaloBoston were the worst that I have
	ever heard as far emotion goes  They had the enthusiasm of
	Droopy Dog  I hope for better on Thursday

It is meaningless to compare one player's plusminus statistic with
another players' out of the context of the role and the playing time
of the players involved    

To compare Jagr's and Francis's plusminus is ridiculous and absurd

Way back in the early years 's it took  wins to garner the Stanley Cup 
Soooooo a couple of local fish mongers local to the Joe Louis Arena that is
started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win  After
each victory one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the
ice  They are dead by the way  It was a brilliant marketing strategy to
shore up the demand for one of their least popular products

Hope this helps

J Lange


Local to the Joe Louis Arena You mean local to Olympia Stadium where
Red Wings games were played until fairly recently early s comes to
mind As far as I know the rest of the post is basically correct If
what you meant by local was simply Detroit and I'm being incredibly
picky okay sorry about that

 Soderstrom plays with Philly but he doesn't have a moulded mask
 He's got the helmet and cage variety in white  Or at least that's
 what he wore thirteen hours ago
 
Yeah but Soderstrom's mask has always appeared to be a lot bigger than the  
average helmetandcage variety  It has a certain appeal on its own

You can't be serious  I and many of my colleagues have not received any
bad emails from Roger in fact Roger happens to have answered most if not
all of my hockey questions and curiosities so before you start flaming
at me or Roger better reconsider your nasty attitude towards Roger and the

I heard a little while back that Gary Roberts would be returning to play
in Calgary's last regular season game  Can anybody confirm this
He'll be a big help to the Flames in the playoffs and may change my
playoff pool strategy


Roberts played in last night game against the Sharks and got a goal th
and an assist

This definitely bolsters Calgary's chances in the playoffs

Okay here's the down side of the ESPN deal no additional coverage

Does anyone know if there will be alternate games in cities where
local broadcast rights are being protected

For our area IslandersDevils it's likely to be the Bruins since
the other Adams series is MontrealQuebec  I'd prefer the latter
myself 

I'm under the impression that the ABC deal overrides the local deals
but if St Louis at Chicago pops up we'll know

I have been to all  IslesCaps tilts at the Crap Centre this year all Isles
wins and there is no justification for Vukota and Pilon to play for the Isles
Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world He couldn't hit a
bull in the ass with a banjo Al must remember a few years back when Mick 
scored  goals in one period against the Caps in a  Isles win I was there
and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd Wakeup Al Years later he's
gotten worse He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting
stupidsenseless penalties I think he would make a good police officier

As for Pilon he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself He either
makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover or he attempts to bring the puck 
towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater He can't
stay on his skates with most forwards or centers He either falls down or 
committs a penalty Call up somebody from Capital District AL

As far as the playoffs the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps
Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent They should meet in the first
round The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they
should play well against Jersey tonite It'll probably be another tight goal
game as the last  games hve been for the Isles I wish when the get a lead
they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive
shell and letting the opposition get back in the game Al MUST understand he
can't do with this team what he did with the  Isles maybe Al should got
to Where is Bobby Nystrom Clark Gilles John Tonelli These are the kind
of young minds we need behing the bench    FIRE AL

You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan Anybody who plays
the way he does does not belong in the NHL There have been cheap shot artists
through the history of the game but a lot of them have been talanted players
Bobby Clarke Kenny Linsemen Pie McKenzie Chris Chelios etc but nobody has been
out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf Violence in hockey has got to be curbed
and players like Should have been a Women Samuelson don't belong When players
like Ulf who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed
to continue and the league won't stop it the players should A Christian Pro 
aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely If the Bruins get
a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future you can bet Neely will have his day
The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is is worth almost as much as a
Stanely Cup This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers
in the game If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup the Penguins would not
even notice he's gone He's an eyesore on the game of hockey

Speaking of Roger where is his comments from last nights game You have
to admit he can make a nothing game sound like it was game  of the
Stanley Cup finals
Roger pushes the Leafs so much it even bothers me a long time supporter
but he does have a good overall idea of the game

So I don't know what you mean by parity Boston never was is not now 
and never will be as good an organization as the Montreal Canadiens


Never was  Probably  Is not now  Debatable  What other valid test can
you think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner  What
do you propose a worthless vote like they do in college football  What a
joke

You Boston fans make me laugh you're going crazy based on a very 
recent Boston domination over Montreal in the playoffs I mean how 
many cups has Boston won compared to Montreal's  And who do you 
think is going to win the next cup between the  teams Montreal 
or Boston You know Sinden's going to find some way of screwing up 
even this good Boston team He'll fire Suter or trade away a vital 
star Admittedly his last few trades have been good ones but how 
long before his luck runs out and he starts making Espositofor
Ratelle type trades again 


If I remember right Brad Park was also involved in that trade  He wasn't
all that bad a hockey player

But let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years

 for Rick Middleton Rangers  I don't know who Sinden gave up for Middle
ton so I'll call this one a 

Barry Pederson for Cam Neely Canucks    Any questions

Greg Hawgood for Vladimir Ruzicka Oilers   Didja see that one Rosie
roofed against Roy in last year's playoffs

CourtnallRanford for Andy Moog Oilers  A wash  Moog is a good goaltender
Ranford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year and Courtnall always
seems to get his points  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall
as a defensive liability

Ken Linseman for Dave Poulin Flyers   Any more questions

JanneyQuintal for Adam Oates Blues    Janney is an enormous talent and
a personable guy the the Bruins play in Adam's Division  Enough said

Soeven if you count the EspositoVadnaisRatelleParkI don't remember who 
else Joe Zanussi trade as a double minus Harry the Horse trader comes
out on top  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry not
in spite of him

BTW do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season  I'll bet 
they finish fourth or fifth in the Conference behind any of the following
Pittsburgh Quebec Boston Washington Islanders  Someone correct me if
these five teams will not be in Montreal's conference

In summary things look bleak for the Habs at least in the near future  I
suspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be
that team that Lindros didn't want to play for

I admit that I've been suffering lately with the Boston gets hot while 
Montreal swans in the playoffs type years But I do have the sure 
knowledge that the Montreal braintrust will keep plugging away until 
they hit the right formula for yet another cup Whereas if I were a 
Boston fan I'd have this kind of despair that as long as Harry Sinden 
is running the show the Bruins will always be good but never 
good enough

Much text deleted

   plusminus  it is the most misleading hockey stat available

Not necessarily the most misleading but you are right it definitely
needs to be taken in the proper perspective A shining example is
if you look at the Penguins individual  you will find very few minuses
That only makes common sense since they didn't lose many games

   Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
   time per game and some measure of its quality ie is the player put out
   in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up
   against the other team's top one or two lines shorthanded etc I would
   much rather see the  disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
   merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications

Unfortunately you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to
really come up with a statistic which really shows a player's value
Let's just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it like I'm doing now
excuse me

 It is meaningless to compare one player's plusminus statistic with

 To compare Jagr's and Francis's plusminus is ridiculous and absurd

	I can't believe that the NY Rangers would force its 
players to go to Binghamtom to play in the AHL playoffs instead
of letting them represent their countries in the World Championships

Anderrson and Zubov are waiting for the NHL to make a decision to this
while Kovalev has given in and gone down to the minors

The Rangers are a disgrace

I too am of the same  sentiment Bart but realistically this town DOESN'T WANT TO pay for

 It was nice to see ESPN show game  between the Wings and Leafs since
the Cubs and Astros got rained out Instead of showing another baseball
game they decided on the Stanley Cup Playoffs A classy move by ESPN


It was a classy move  But it looks like ESPN is going to devote most of
the coverage to the Pens  On Tuesday night they continued to broadcast
the PenDevil game even though Pittsburgh had the game well in control
Granted they did show some bonus coverage of the Caps and Isles but
they cut away from the close game which went into double ot to update
us on the fifth goal of the rout
Thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between
the pens and devils  IMHO they should program some variety into the
telecastsYes I know the game shown on saturday is between the B's and
Sabres probably throwing a bone to us Bruin fans
And what about the Cambell conference  I'd like to see a game in the
Norris or Smythe  Why not have back to back nights of National

    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN LEAD SERIES 

It was a great atmosphere last night at the St Louis Arena as Joseph and
the Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game People were
cheering the Blues long before faceoff time and they kept going for the
entire game My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning
hours with some of the players Here's a game summary from the St Louis
PostDisptach Enjoy

By Dave Luecking
Of The PostDispatch Staff

At  pm Friday night The Arena crowd of  paid homage to Blues
goalie Curtis Joseph The fans began bowing their arms extended taking the
the lead from a fan who held a sign that read Only God Saves More Than
Joseph  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph who has brought the Blues to
the verge of a surprising sweep

Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday blanking the Blackhawks
 in Game  of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 
lead in the bestofseven series

The Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the  mark of the second
period of Game  Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for  minutes  seconds
a Blues record Jacques Plante held the previous record of  set in the
first round of the  playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers one of only
two series the Blues have sweeped in their history

The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since  with a victory in Game 
a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday The Blues have had
only two sweeps in franchise history both in  when they swept
Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals

The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game  when Joseph had to
make  saves This time the Blues held the shots down to  and the
Blackhawks couldn't touch Joseph

Well they touched Joseph numerous times shoving him and pushing him at 
every opportunity to try to get him off his game But Joseph and the Blues
were unfazed dishing out their own punishment along the way

The Blues' grinders  Bob Bassen Rich Sutter Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry 
wore down the Blackhawks taking the visitors from Chicago off their game
The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys the gifted playmakers and
scorers who made the most of their opportunities

Craig Janney Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored getting one goal in each
period Hull assisted on Janney's firstperiod power play goal after two unwise
Chicago penalties Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period and
rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson who scored at  of the final 
period

Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling
Sweep Sweep Sweep They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour 
BellFour BellFour They also chanted Na nanana heyhey good bye

Such talk is a tad premature There's still one game left but the Blues are
on a roll They have the Blackhawks on their heels

The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first
minute of play Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment and Brendan Shanahan
dumped Steve Smith at center ice

Chicago tried to retaliate but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph
backfired Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty

The Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play and they survived a
scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to
Steve Larmer Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw
at him in the first period The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph
about shooting high and continued to shoot low where Joseph's butterfly
style is deadly

Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the
period  two for hooking and one for holding  but Chicago got only two
shots on goal as many as Miller The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the
puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour
 
Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up
He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third
penalty He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 
and gave the Blues a twoman advantage  later when Christian Ruuttu
slashed Shanahan

The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play and Hull got it
where he likes it  in the high slot Hull's shot hit Belfour's right
shoulder and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line Belfour
dived back to cover but the puck squirted loose to Janney who poked it into
the net at  for his first goal of the playoffs

The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended and the
Blackhawks lost their composure Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds
remaining in the period and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by
shooting the puck into the Blues' bench

Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice and
Marouelli slapped him with a minute misconduct Chicago survived the Blues'
power play but the loss of Chelios hurt He didn't return until the midway
point of the period and within three minutes of his return Hull had increased
the Blues' lead to  deflecting in Miller's crisp pass

Try as they might the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph who stopped
everything they could throw at him He stopped  shots in the second period
and  more in the third Chicago also hit the goalpost twice

Emerson's goal put the game away He went hard to the net and redirected
Felsner's pass

The USA Today says late this year  The question is will hockey be moved to
ESPN permenantly or will it be where they have a game of the week on
ESPN and have a bunch of other games on ESPN


Yes and No ESPN will be launched as early in September Cap Cities
are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good startup
base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service

The problem ESPN faces is the TCICablevision connection in the
merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks Prime SportsChannel
will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the offseason AlsoTCI
and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the
country with a total of  million subscribers TCICablevision will
do their best that ESPN never gets off the ground successfully And the
NHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC
and ESPN NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime
SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports
contracts and only cover local NHLNBAMLB sports teams

Game Summary

Say if anybody from Buffalo is reading this where did you people get that
woman who sang the anthems We had to turn down the volume

The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have
been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only  shots in the
first period They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday
when they gave up  shots in the last two periods Maybe Tommy told them that
he was getting bored back there

Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it After
Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards
to Eric  way up on his left Eric dropped it to Galley and he sent it ahead
to Recchi steaming out of the zone Mark skated into the center circle passed
the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik skated around him and
in on Fuhr Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his
stick Recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the
right past Fuhr for a  FLYERS lead at  It was so beautiful Eric and
Garry should turn down their assists 

The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that but he was strong
and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage The game then became a defensive
struggle for a while The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when
Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at  for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into
the boards in the FLYERS zone LaFontaine got the only scoring chance and not
a terribly good one as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play Mogilny got
a post after it was over The th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS

Keith Carney took a holding penalty at  for taking down Mark Recchi to
give the FLYERS a power play The best penalty killing team in the league
didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal although the FLYERS did create a
good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot Towards
the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept
missing the net Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at  to give
the Sabres another power play but they couldn't get anything going and the
fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck Shots
were  Buffalo after the FLYERS had led  at one point

Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods Jay was
disappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged This was considered
a rebuilding year after The Trade and he seemed very happy with the way the
season went When asked if he agonized over The Trade he said that it was
Russ Farwell's trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and Ed
Snider as far as the money But yes there was some agonizing and they'd do
it all over again When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for
next year he said that it's Russ' call and Russ will evaluate things at the
end of the season He feels that they're  years away from a shot at the Cup
He expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title
the following year and a shot at the finals the year after that This based
on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer

He's very happy with the realignment he called it outstanding Happy with
the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux
of Europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable
Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics booo but said that there
was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in
four years if there was a consensus

The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May
took a tripping penalty at  of the second The FLYERS had a little trouble
getting started but eventually did Hawgood took a pass as he was moving
throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres
blue line along the right boards Eklund carried into the zone nad passed
across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the
top of the left circle He half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling
through the slot Fuhr didn't know where it was though and Hawgood won the
race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 

Then Mogilny on a breakaway He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line
and went in on Soderstrom He went with the backhander but Soderstrom was
all over it

The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them
Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when
Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to Gary Dornhoefer
took a dive to get the other there was no video at  The Sabres coudln't
get started Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the
FLYERS zone and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and
headed the other way It started out a  on  but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to
make it a  on  and back off the defenseman Dineen let it rip from the top
of the right circle to make it  FLYERS at  That was all for Fuhr John
Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over

But the Sabres still had lots of power play time Again they took some time to
just get into the FLYERS zone and when they finally did the FLYERS were all
over them Boos began to ring through the building But they finally got through
Soderstrom on an ugly goal Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that
missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot Hawerchuk tried a backhander as
he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it
Mistake  he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried
about A the rebound or B Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right
next to the net Well the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom and
mistake  Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the
puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie He didn't even swing his
stick out to try and knock the puck away With the goal at  two streaks
end for the FLYERS  of shutout hockey and  straight penalty kills

Lindros put them right back on the power play at  with a high sticking
minor I think it was Barnaby again This time the Sabres were able to get
set up quickly but couldn't get too much quality on goal The Sabres continued
to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended
Things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty McGill
allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a
faceoff The gloves were dropped and McGill started pounding the crap out of
him But during the fight he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet and
that meant a match penalty  for slashing  fighting and  for the major
 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at  Barnaby only got 

The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long
they could do that After a couple of good Sabre chances Audette handed to
Ledyard at the point and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by
Soderstrom LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of
the net and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right Soderstrom had
moved over to play LaFontaine and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving
at the puck instead of picking up men Wood just slid it into the empty net
at  to close the FLYERS lead to  LaFontaine was actually trying to
put it on net but half fanned on it and got a break

The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone but Hasek
was strong Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the
neutral zone and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS
blue line Another minibreakaway for Mogilny he elected to shoot from the
left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at
 for his th of the season Ironically the youth hockey tip between
the st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off
angles

That was all in the nd shots were  Sabres

Into the rd period and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the
FLYERS the lead back A  on  Acton with the puck he dropped to Eklund in
the slot and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until
he had almost no angle at all to shoot from When he finally did shoot he
hit the far post That was still during the carryover power play time

Than an incredible almost goal Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood
untouched into Soderstrom Soderstrom goes down Wood pokes the puck under
Soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the net Red light comes on
horn sounds crowd cheers But up to the video replay booth for some strange
reason and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they
could be reviewing Well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade
that went into the net not the puck Emrick mentions that one of the criteria
for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net

Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at  The FLYERS
could not get anything going at all They finally got set up  way through
but were kept on the perimeter As time ran out Beranek stripped the puck
from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across
to Eklund at the top of the left circle Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net
just inside the right circle and passed through to him Dineen fumbled the pass
but twice directed it at Hasek and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing
puck over the goalie for his th at   FLYERS

But the Sabres came right back LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive
left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net Erry started to skate
out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net Mogilny flew
in skated around and stuffed it through Soderstrom's  hole for his th at
 to tie the game at 

Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at  The FLYERS set up
in the Sabres zone and stayed there Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in
the middle While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck Dineen snuck through the
line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 

Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 
The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone Brind'Amour and Ledyard went
after it and Rod got the puck He backed away from the right boards skated
to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing
through the slot all by himself Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over
the blocker of Hasek for a  FLYERS lead at  rd hat trick of the season
for Dineen th of his career nd shorthanded goal of the game for him th
of the season

Then Carney took a tripping penalty at  to kill the rest of the Sabres
power play Not much action on the  on  and the Sabres got most of the
chances on the FLYERS resulting power play

Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to
make some big saves The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running 
out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres
Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left
corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him He pulled away and found
Dineen on the other side of the left circle and Dineen found Acton at the
right of Hasek He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders and Acton
chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his th of the season at 
on his th birthday That was all the scoring shots were  Buffalo
and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the
game

So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much
in his last couple of starts Kevin Dineen has a career high  point night
unless he had a better night earlier in the season but I don't think so
The FLYERS longest winning streak in  years  goals for only  against
with three shutouts Eric Lindros is th in league with  even strength goals
despite missing  games with injury  points out of th clinched th place
since the Rangers lose the tie breaker

A couple misc notes

Forget the Mike Keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to
announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year

In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award
but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman

The Times of Trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma
has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no
further tests are necessary in the near future

Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he
expected to be back next year His response was that he wants to come back
he feels he did a good job this year but that he would cheerfully accept a
role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back

	PETER AHOLA		Season nd
Acquired	' trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations
Grade		I B

It is way too early to tell about Ahola who was acquired probably because the
Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft  Ahola had
only played  games this season I think it's actually less the San Jose
Mercury News may be in err here  of them with the Sharks  In the games he
has played he appeared quite solid defensively although he hasn't been
spectacular and his offense isn't anything to write home about  points
it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn
out to be  Peter Ahola

	DOUG WILSON		Season th
Acquired	' trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and
		nd round pick in ' entry draft
Grade		I B

I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson I may have had too high
expectations for him but his legs knees et al are giving out
Nevertheless when he was playing he exhibited a strong shooting and
playmaking abilities even if he has lost a step on defense which
unfortunately he demonstrated this year as well as at times he was slow to
catch the opponent forwards and his offensive output was only good enough for
nd place on the team  points in  games  But next year which may be
Wilson's last if he can stay healthy he can still be a contributor

	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season	nd
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		I CD

It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of
games forgetting exact number but no more than  but at age  he's
quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL  In those games
he did not impress anyone after generating  shots in the first period of
the first game he played he scored just  points in his tenure up here with
the Sharks and was even less impressive defensively as he appeared awkward
with his movement and was prone to giveaways  He needs to make a leap in
his level of performance to have any chance of making the team

	PAT MACLEOD		Season nd
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		I 

MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad but it appears to my
memory that he played less than Kolstad because the Sharks were reluctant to
use him but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors figuring that
he wouldn't clear waivers in fact he has played the past  weeks with
Kansas City but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment
a rehab assignment that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs
Since he has played so little I can't even give a tentative grade on him but
he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive
skills

	TOM PEDERSON		Season st
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		I B

Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated
by injuries Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net including yours
truly  He demonstrated very good offensive skills scoring  points in
 games  However his size '   lbs is of concern and soon after
he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically
on both sides of the ice although he had appeared fearless in his approach
But to be successful he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance
on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league

	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season st
Acquired	' from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		I DD

He played all of  games in the league this year but was thoroughly
umimpressive just as he was at the end of last season again it may be a
small sample but just as in the case of Kolstad Scremin at age  is
quickly running out of time  He was not a contributor on either offense or
defense in the games he played with the Sharks  The only notable thing that
will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he
was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre

 And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded 
 resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other 
 team captain trivia would be appreciated
 
 Brad McCrimmon was the captain of the Flames when he was traded to Detroit
 following the  season This was during the offseason though
 
 There's countless examples of captains being traded I'm sure

Yeah I think that the Flames and the Flyers traded Captains once Mel  
Bridgeman for Brad Marsh

The problem ESPN faces is the TCICablevision connection in the
merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks Prime SportsChannel
will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the offseason Also TCI
and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the
country with a total of  million subscribers TCICablevision will
do their best that ESPN never gets off the ground successfully And the
NHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC
and ESPN NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime
SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports
contracts and only cover local NHLNBAMLB sports teams

Note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various SC
and Prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local NHL owners
WhenIf Cablevision VP Chuck Dolan's purchase of the Islanders goes
through the Islanders will be back solidly in the SCNY fold their
original owners were and they've remained due to a lucrative TV
contract  The Flyer Snyders own the Philadelphia SC as well as the
Prism pay channel  There are six teams affiliated with regional SC's
another half dozen affiliated with Prime outlets and other locals
like HTS and NESN who have barter arrangements  With all this
crossownership I was surprised that ESPN got the deal this 
season

 I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton
 Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference
 next week While the exact details are not known it is believed
 to concern the Oiler's future

 Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement
 with Copps Collesium in Hamilton During the press conference
 Pocklington may announce the deal It is quite possible that
 the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to
 renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium

 Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for  million earlier
 but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington

 As for me my opinion is divided Edmonton has been fairly
 supportive of the Oilers Even though they're a small market
 team they had many sellouts in the s Even with the problems
 that the team had this year they still brought in more fans
 than many teams in larger cities did On the other hand if
 the team does move there is no place more deserving than
 Hamilton Of course how would that affect the grand
 realignment scheme of Bettman


  Following up on this the provincial government has been asked by the
Opposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton  The
government said that Pock is going nowhere

  Why don't I believe the government  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be
Tory leader  years ago

I prefer
to watch hockey than seeing shots of Felix Potvin slashing and spearing Dino
Ciccerelli standing in front of the net  HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO STAND IN
FRONT OF THE NET JUST NOT IN THE CREASE
 
 Yes he does  BUT the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there  When
 I played roller hockey boy do I miss those days as a goalie I would
 scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot  I don't care if he's
 in the crease or not get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball
 Yes roller hockey remember  And if there was nobody around to clear
 the slot then I'd do it myself by pushing the offending playerhard 
 I hate people in my way when I'm the goalie and I am sure Felix does
 too  I should say that I didn't see the incident so if Potvin really
 swung the stick big time then that's not right but he can move people
 out of the way  He's a player on the ice too you know

I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view  I don't like to see stickwork
but you have to clear players away from in front  My personal favorite move
I'm a goalie too is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back
of their skates when the ref isn't looking  Makes 'em go down like a ton of
bricks but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall I'm 
talking about hitting the blades here not the foot  It also makes the 
player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid
retaliation penalty  Unfortunately it also leaves your blocker out of 
position for a short timeI don't do this if a shot is likely on the short
side  Hmmmaybe I should mail Potvin this method in French and with
helpful diagrams of course  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli who
I have a great deal of respect for BTW he's not a big guy but he plays
huge fall on his back a few times

They're real and they're spectacular the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in
consecutive playoff games 

If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday I will launch a broom onto the ice
in the last seconds of the game Not that there's anything wrong with that

Curtis Joseph has been the master of his own domain and the Hawks have
been shooting the puck like a bunch of chuckers Not even Superman could
play any better in goal Joseph must have been eating his cereal

It's like a sauna in here said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and
the wild crowd at the Arena

It was very refreshing to see the Blues doubledip the Hawks

The Hawks goons tried to pick on Hull Janney and Joseph but the Blues
checking line nipped those Hawks real well

The fat Yoyoma will sing on Sunday and the Hawks will head to the beach
The Hawks' trip back to Chicago will feel like a long journey from Milan
to Minsk

Enjoy Sunday's game with some Junior Mints and wash them down with a Snapple

Just a little fun

Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure  Don use to coach the
Boston Bruins  I don't know exactly when that was  Could someone fill
me in on this info

I think that the name 'grapes' came because as coach for the Bruins 
or in the minors  he used to chew on grapes to keep from getting 
dehydrated during the games  His dog Blue may have been named 
'cause he liked Labatts beer  anyone know about that 

According to Quotations from Chairman Cherry Don was playing in
Springfield He and another player had to pay some fines the other
player had his paid off but not Don didn't want to

Don called the other player a teacher's Pet and the other player
replied Ah that's just sour grapes

Don't know how accurate that is but that's what's printed

 The Keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated M
in playoff revenue and fears of losing season ticketholders  plus
Paramount chief Stan Jaffe's chip against the Flyers over l'Affaire
Lindros last autumn  Add to this that Neilsen might return as an
assistant coach Gerald what'd I say earlier today and Roger
conferred with Jaffe on the hiring  This hiring by Jaffe went over
the head of MSG Inc Par subsidiary head Bob Gutkowski and over
the head and the protests of PresGM Neil Smith

 MSG is making the announcement on Saturday to get back at the
Islanders for making the playoffs ie steal the press

 Flyers owner Ed Snyder is livid and beside himself over this

 Keenan will make up to yr

 Gary Bettman has appointed an independent consul to look at
Gil Stein's admission into the Hall of Fame

 New crease colours rather than blue

 The Oilers will charge to eat in the Press Room next year

It's about time the boys got it together
They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games
But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full
gear or is that high gear in game   Except for a  minute stretch
in the nd period they outskated and outworked the Wings  Please don't
flame this statement 'cos you know it's true  I have to admit that 
goaltending was the key  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy
stretch the Leafs went through in the nd  He also kept the rebounds to a
minimum something that cost Cheveldae  goals  Clark even looked like
he had stopped moping first star although I still don't know why he
was so flat in games  and 

If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game
 they may actually have a chance of winning this series a slim chance 
but a chanceI'm no RMwhere is he anyways haha

Have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewed
in between periods on a tv game That they usually get a goal or
an assist can you explain this or is it that they usually talk 
to stars more than regular players which explains the hight 
percentage of results after

Just wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they dont 
care about this trivial nonsense

Buffalo fans

Some people in the discussion group as well as commentator Al on ESPN 
believe that game  is critical for the Sabres  HELLOOOO The Sabres 
are AHEAD  games to  not behind  As a lifelong Sabres fan I am well 
aware of their ability to choke but let's not exaggerate that  As long as 
the Sabres win one of the next  games be it game  OR game  they are 
still in good shape ahead  games to  with game  to be played at 
Buffalo  If they lose games three AND four then start worrying  Game  is 
critical for Boston not Buffalo

Fuhr is proving the Fuhrbashers wrong but Boston is an awfully
good team


Yehbut 

Biran Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in StL wasn't very
impressive His Blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs
It doesn't look like this trend will change with the Bruins

 Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind  in their
entire year history It doesn't look like Buffalo will just lose
their next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on
his head

Basicallythe Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend
Alsoit seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after
an incredibly great start by the Red Soxbest record in their major
leagues as of now I would say that  of the callers to the Bruins'
flagship stationSportsRadio  are talking about the Red Soxabout
 are yapping about the Patriots' upcoming draft are on the Celtics
and about  are on the Bruins
Somehowno one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding
early

Well we're almost halfway through the first round and so far things are
good in general

   The  teams that I hate most Chicago and Basten are down  zip
     even though there is a possibility either can still win their
      series yet this egothrashing and arrogancesmashing by the
      underdogs St Louis and Buffalo is so rewarding
   Montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good
     enough to go all the way yet too good to be able to get some
     really good draft picks 
   Is it just me or does anyone out there also think that this year
     the cup final should be played between  teams from the WALES
   Is it just because they're playing Montreal that I find the diques
     arrogant 's or are they really

When is the draft this year  And will there be any coverage
I know the upcomming NFL draft is on ESPN

Anyone got the details

Paul Kariya   Pick No  perhaps  He won't last long 

I don't know the exact coverage in the states  In Canada it is covered
by TSN so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage  I don't know

As for the picks
Ottawa picks  which means it is almost  that Alexander Daigle will 
go  He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec  IMO I would
take Kariya  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team

San Jose will then get Kariya

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov I think that's it or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong

	The Sharks appear to be leaning toward picking Rob
	Niedermayer a center his brother Scott  is a defenseman
	picked by NJ a couple years ago  They brought him in for a
	physicaltryout a week or so ago From what I have read
	Niedermayer is the best skater in the draft plays BOTH
	offense and defense and isn't afraid of physical play
	Defensively the Sharks are looking pretty good in terms of
	defense prospects Rathje Sykora Ragnarsson and our
	centers Kisio et al are getting old

	With all of the small players the Sharks have I justs CAN't
	see them picking yet another small player like Kariya he'd
	just get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated 
	shoulder

 The thing that confuses me most about ESPN is that they decided to show the 
 Penguins and Devils again on Thursday night  Being that both of the first 
 two games were dominated by Pitt you would think that they would show a 
 different game  This is in addition to the fact that they should show other 
 games just for the sake of fair exposure

ESPN must have some very poor marketing people  They are only concerned with
featuring players ie Mario than featuring good competitive hockey

 Also some of you should know that as far as I can tell ESPN is not going 
 to show Campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds  I 
 believe that they are only going to show Campbell games in the first two 
 rounds as those series wear on games    or perhaps games    

I've heard that this is because most of their market is East Coast and hence
would prefer the Wales stuff  Also don't expect Canadian teams on ESPN

In summary if you want to see a network that provides good hockey coverage 
watch CBC from Canada  They may be biased toward Canadian teams but they
don't treat the viewers like idiots they provide nice updates and Don Cherry
will always provide a few laughs

According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN should the Islanders win tonite
the two teams will have the same record but the Devils will be playing the
Penguins  This is because the Islanders have won the season series against
the Devils  I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include

  season series
  goals against
  goals for

in this order correct me if I'm wrong  Anyone have anything to add

I think that they go to divisional records before goals but I could be

In case anyone missed it I'm reposting this and I'm also selling some other
stuff

I would like to sell a few of my Hockey Cards sets

 Upperdeck Hockey Low 's Sets 

This is the first Upperdeck Hockey Set made Important rookie cards in it are
Mogilny Roenick Belfour Recchi Stevens Jagr Nolan Nedved Ricci 
Sundin Modano Richter and others The Beckett price is  but I'm
Charging  to cover the Shipping and Packaging

I've sold one but I still have  left for sale I also realize that  is
alot of money especially if you don't normally collect cards So if enough
people are interested I'll break up the set into team sets I'm not sure
how much for each It would be nice to just sell them for  each but then
the people who get the Whalers and Devils Note I'm not bagging on these teams
its just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set would
be subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh So I'll have to make
it varialble pricing But most of them should be about  or  dollars


 Score Pinnacle Candian Sets 

This is a very nice set premium quality cards Has second year cards of the
players above plus Bure Potvin Falloon and Lindros  value second year
cardsand the following rookie cards Lidstrom Kamensky Zelepukin Roussel
Konstantinov Beckett Price is  but I have alot of these

 Upperdeck Czechoslovakian Set 

This is a  card set of the  World Junior Tournament Meant for sale in
Czechoslovakia but didn't sell well there and some of it filtere back in
to the US The cards are Bilingual Has Lachance Kovalev and Straka Rookies
If your interested please email me Thanks

Ok someone asked for this one but he's from Canada if he can get me the
money in US funds then its his if not the first person who writes in will
be the alternate

Also I would like to sell  Upperdeck Pavel Bure rookie cards note these
are not in the UD low 's set mentioned above  each They are  in
the book but the  goes for postage packaging and insurance

And if there is something you want that you don't see email me I may have
it or may be able to get  it for you

ESPN is pathetic I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage
and I agree with all of you  Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up
over nothing  We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck  I mean have
you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey It
sucks I mean really sucks  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the
ass  I was really pissed of about last night coverage  I go to school in Ohio
I know the Indians suck so why show them  If I were Bill Clement I would
shoot myself

Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show
overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going
to happen in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even
the boring Devils game

Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly
belive that they have know respect for the fans ie because of contract       
obligations screw you ESPN

Praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit

GO HAWKS


This is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving
ESPN  or  years agoit will take time to correct for that mistake

But returning to ESPN was the correct decision last yearby next
time we may have the potential for Sportschannel and ESPN to really
compete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it

Here we are with the Sabres up  to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm
team the Rochester Amerks on their way to the Calder Cup urp and
what kind of hockey coverage are we getting The same PenguinsDevils
every other day crap that everyone else gets What's worse the
SportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out
since we got CBA basketball last night if you can believe it  I
assume the Sabres are demanding the SC blackout not ESPN since we
are unbelievably usually considered part of the Islanders territory
MSG coverage of the Rangers is blacked out here This despite being
a solid seven hours plus from Long Island

Does anyone know what GRC is doing besides putting their satellite
dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels   and 
Did Empire demand a fortune for the games What about the games on
Fox or whatever number it is there in Buffalo Has anyone phoned
to complain besides me

  Buffalo is up  is the series with Boston and the reasonGrant Fuhr 
  Fuhr is playoff hungry and he's proving once again why they call him
  money goaltender Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the
  league anymore Statistically at least but he's proving that he can
  make the big save at the right time
  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr and probably would have had a chance 
  against powerhouse Detroit But againwhere was Andreychoke in game 

I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr specifically because I
thought it would help them win at least one playoff series  However I don't
think the Leafs can be faulted eitherthere is nothing to say that Felix
won't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come  

Anyway does anybody else find it ironic that Fuhr is up against Moog or at
least he was until a guy named Alex showed up

Lori the regular Penguins poster here on recsporthockey indicated to me

  What the hell are U talking about ESPN showed PensDevils game as advertised
  BUt the morons at ESPN should know that Pens will kick Devils ass and the
  game will be boring I'd rather see BostonBuffalo game which seems to be
  an exciting series since noone had expected Buffalo to get past the first
  round 

  Well let's hope they change their mind on THU's game and show some other
  game The Pens series is really getting boring I want to see some 
  exciting game no matter who wins If NHL wants a major network contract
  then they better put some brains in ESPN people

Don's Tie Grant Fuhr Penalties Wings vs Leafs Fighting Dale Hunter

Episode Summary


This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie Don was
pointing out the characters on the tie Bugs Bunny Foghorn Leghorn
and Yosemite Sam who Don called Lanny Macdonald

Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a
hotel where he was watching the previous night's games because of
all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter
and Fuhr

Don began to praise Fuhr calling him the greatest goalie and
said that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself
He then showed clips from earlier episodes Nov  Jan  when
Fuhr was still with the Leafs and Don advised Don't Trade Fuhr

Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston it would
be Fuhr who wins the series Muckler took a lot of heat for the
trade but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated

The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by
too many penalty calls He showed a clip from a WinnipegVancouver
game where Domi hit a Vancouver player and was given a  min penalty
Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved
but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit with Domi
hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder Don Its sad what
they're doing for hockey a  minute penalty for a nosebleed

Next they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto
People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke Wendy for not fighting
However Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either

This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork and how
banning fighting leads to more high sticking It's like college
hockey The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody
That's why you're seeing so much stickwork Because they know you
won't drop your gloves and give them a shot The rules are made
by people who don't know what's going on in hockey

The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter Don pointed out
that he was leading the league in goals and showed a clip
of Hunter from a previous game When he was younger Hunter was
taught to play to win which differs from today's idea of
just letting kids have fun

At then end of the episode they showed a clip from a coach's
corner with the tape on fast forward so that Don sounded like
one of the chipmunks

Typical antifighting posturing not too much humour but some
good quotes

Don's Tie Doug Gilmour WingsLeafs QuebecMontreal BostonBuffalo
Wendel Clark Fighting and Stickwork

Episode Summary


Once again the episode started with a shot of Don's tie This
was a different tie than last time Don pointed out some of the
characters on the tie but gave them different names Felix the
Cat Sylverster Maclean Daffy Duck etc

Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current WingsLeafs
game Don thought it was good Burns told the Leaf players They
won in their building we're going to win in ours

Don then began to praise Gilmour again Don pointed out that Gilmour
has never got less than  points or a goal in any game since he
got  points in a game against St Louis  Don also claims that
he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour which was partly responsible
for his good play Several clips were then shown of Gilmour
from the series A hit on Constantinov and a pass to Andrewchuk
resulting in a goal

On the game itself the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in
the first period The Wings have enough talent to score short handed
however and when the Leafs get a power play Coach Burns tells
the Leaf players Don't let them score on you

Ron brought up the previous QuebecMontreal game Note Montreal
won that game in overtime despite having a possible game winner
disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick Don
thought the high stick was obvious even without the use of
instant replay

On the BuffaloBoston series Note Buffalo is currently winning
the series  Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr
Fuhr should be getting  the team's playoff checks for his
play

Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance
during the DetroitToronto series Don defended him by saying
that he can't play the way he should because of the league's
new rules This used to be a rough and tough league Now its
all hack and slash Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the
problems

Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings
GM and coach Bryan Murray A clip from a news conference by Murray
was shown in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination
of fighting increases stickwork Don also read a newspaper article
in which Murray makes the following statements Players don't fight
because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator
Instead they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing
each other Is this what the fans want to see I guarantee there
wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game

Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to smarten up with
fighting in hockey He went on to say that before there used
to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series Now with no fights
someone gets cut every period

Typical antifighting posturing but here Don's opinion is supported
by Murray

I'd give it a  out of

The thing that confuses me most about ESPN is that they decided to show the 
Penguins and Devils again on Thursday night  Being that both of the first 
two games were dominated by Pitt you would think that they would show a 
different game  This is in addition to the fact that they should show other 
games just for the sake of fair exposure

Also some of you should know that as far as I can tell ESPN is not going 
to show Campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds  I 
believe that they are only going to show Campbell games in the first two 
rounds as those series wear on games    or perhaps games    

Also does anyone have info on ABC coverage for this Sunday 



  ESPN had an advertise for PensDevils game  I don't know what the hell
  they are trying to do especially against NFL draft Well I guess there goes
  the NHL ratings for Sundays game

In article rvnklhmorrowstanfordedu stevesepStanfordEDU Steve Cole writes
I think the threeheaded GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans
in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant advantage

Doesn't sound like a bad strategy to me

No and in fact that was Ferreira's original strategy which the troika
proceeded to simply continue to implement There wasn't exactly a radical
shift in policy when he was ousted something people seem to forget The
only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if
he stayed or whether the basic strategy was flawed since Ferreira has been
quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the
Ducks my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper
and he's tweaking it a bit second time around One also has to wonder
whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those
injuries and whether we're complaining about the weather because an
earthquake collapsed the root cellar

Of course Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal
contributions before he was fired so it's not clear that this would have
been different  Besides they were marginal contributors

Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came THIS close to trading Kelly
Kisio which if the rumors I've heard are true was over the strong
objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do
with both his ouster and the threeheaded consensus oriented GM

Imagine for a second where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine
hadn't jammed

With or without Mullen they weren't going to be a playoff team what good
does it do them to hang onto a player who'd rather be elsewhere  

Especially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it Not
that I'd accuse Mullen of tanking but his motivation simply wasn't there
and that kind of thing can affect the team

An example from this season Skriko was brought in on a trial basis
but not kept because of his age I thought he was a decent
contributor worth keeping around

The youth movement has its advantages look at Gaudreau who
might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around But
you have to find the right balance

Right balance for what  That's the issue  

Exactly At the time they let Skriko go we hadn't yet had the major injury
bugs that killed us later I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone
like Dean Kolstad but at that point that wasn't the choice And since the
choice was more one of Skriko vs someone like John Carter I think the
right choice was made for that time period

I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal
and save percentage numbers for me so I can put these stats on the archive
site  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer

Here are the individual goalie stats as of Wed Apr   CST 

These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date
listed above  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper
every Tuesday  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers so those
are not verified  These stats are available by mail every weekday and
sometimes on weekends if I'm in town and I can get late game results  Just
send me a note if you would like to receive these stats by mail

If you have any questions comments or suggestions let me know

I can't believe that ESPN is making SportsChannel America look good

But only in NYNJ Philadelphia and Chicago Everywhere else the only
reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts

Yes a point welltaken  however even in areas that finally got
some games there's something nagging in the back of your skull when
the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its
sports news There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City
and we'll try to get you an update through the show  when you
know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there 


  Listen guys you can talk about this the whole playoffs  I'm here in a
small town in southern Illinois at school  I'm from Canada and I know
that cbc and tsn have games on every night  all you have to do is go to
a bar with a satellite  I have watched both games between Mon Que and
toronto and detroit  not to mention Van vs Winn and with cbc  They
show all goals from every game that evening so I haven't missed a goal
all playoffs  Well have to go boy leafs are on Ciao

I AM an Ulf and Pgh fan and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves
Ulf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hardhitting hockey nothing wrong with 
that while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to 
intentionally hurt someone which bites

Jeesus I never thought I'd see the day when I defended a Ranger

You obviously don't watch much hockey if you think that Graves is a
goon  He is one of the hardest working Rangers check that THE
hardest working Ranger  He had  goals this year not bad for a
checking type of player and showed up for every single game this
season unlike that stiff Messier  He is fearless and throws CLEAN
checks  He will also stand up to someone after he hits them not like
that pussy Oaf

Exactly my point  If you'd watch games more closely you'd see a lot 
of goons going after him  Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical 
players for Pgh are left alone  Ulf plays rough hockey but only when 
other players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr  If you want to say anyone
on the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon say it's Jennings or Caufield  Don'tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can't beat the Pens
even when they take dives like Gartner to try for the cheap penalties

As for his slash of Lemieux fine  It was a cheap shot  It is the
exception not the rule  I bet you think Mike Gartner is a goon
because of the time that he slashed the hell out of Oaf's arm last
year right  After all he did get a suspension for it

Hey that's fine  If a player does something stupid he should be penalized
including Ulf  Or Mario you're not likely to see that happen or anyone else for that matter  It's pointless to say any one person is a cheapshot goon     because you'll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then especially if you'resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is

 	On Tuesday when it was raining in Chicago ESPN provided 
 bonus hockey coverage  Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off
 that the NYWash OT was replaced with the Angels game  People must
 realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the US  
 The baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so
 they can't skip the baseball game  Why don't you people CHILL OUT
 and enjoy whatever coverage you can get

Well partly because I as an ardent fan of both sports would rather
see Game  of the NHL playoffs than Game  of  of the MLB
season even if the bb game involves the Red Sox	

ESPN may have had contractual obligations I understand that part
But it's a bit inaccurate to call us selfish just because we want
to watch the watch the game we love Am I as a baseball fan selfish
when I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month
I don't think so

While ESPN may have contractual obligations we as their consumers
have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us
There's certainly nothing wrong with that

As if an aluminum stick being taken to Ulf's head is gonna solve the problem
with violence in the sport of hockey  How the hell can you say the guy is
a goon and justify it with your backassward mentality  Saying that hurting
a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine  New rules and a new 
referee system need to be instituted  Right now too many of the real goons
get away with too much because the ref is watching the play or supposed to beI've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond to name a few with their heads up their  asses on a few calls rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the 
play  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties it would be an

Hey American Hockey fans

As a hockey fan I can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel  The
problem is that other Americans don't give a shit about hockey  They view
it as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the
shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in
twothirds of the US to see the stuff naturally  On the other hand
BASEBALL is the gaspswoonsigh NATIONAL PASTTIME  BASEBALL is so
romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport
exist after April  and before November   I feel that since ESPN shows 
BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead
of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game  Hell the game is going to last
hrs mins so what if you miss the first   hrs  And I am an Indians
fan  Show the end of what you started then switch  But then I'm a
hockey fan what do I know  BASEBALL is the all mighty sport

Do the Isles have another defenseman to insert into the lineup besides
Pilon Once again last night's STUPID penalty put the Isles in a hole for the
remainder of regulation and  minutes into overtime Even though the Isles
nearly survived Pilon's blunder in regulation it was the most inopportune time
for a minute major penalty Instead of confronting Cote as he came across the
blueline Pilon backed up and swiped at Cote's nose with his stick Al Arbour
can't be serious to think Pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on
the line I heard Scott LaChance is out till later in the series but there
must be someone else Bring back the BAMMER Dave Langevin

YAHOOOOOOOOO

The Habs tied this sucker at  and the teams now head for Quebec
City to play game   BTW final score was Habs Nords 

The score might be a bit misleading  The Habs dominated the game
from the  mark of the first and then on  The score should have
been  if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall
bastard  He's the reason the score was as close  Habs winning
goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at  of the rd

Roy had an OK game  He made the first save one way or another
and the defense was there to clear any rebounds

This just in ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost  in OT
YAHOOOOOOOOOOO  Those suckers got what they deserved

Montreal edged Quebec  to square their series which seems to be

Like many others I too was watching the CapsIsles game when the went
to the baseball game  I too was pissed  How could they interupt such
an important game  I understand about contracts but you would think they
would have a clause in the contract concerning important games
Anyway  us BLUES and Hawks fans got shafted worse  While everyone
in the US and watched the game on ABC  However those of us who live in
the central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus
Telethon  The area that was most affected by the telecast did not get
to see the game except through HAWK VISION  This game had it been
televised would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the area
since   This television BULL has got to stop  We are not only
being deprived of seeing games due to skyrocketing ticket prices but
we are also being deprived of watching them on TV
 PEACE

Being a a BLUES fan I don't get to see much else from around the league
with the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN  I can't get the BLUES games
where I go to school thus I don't get to see a whole lot of other teams
play except for the Hawks  But last night I got to catch a glimpse of
the CapsIsles game  It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates
His moves are quick and brilliant  You NY fans should be proud
PS Who won the game CapsIsles
 
Peace

Bufflo Sabres has just finished their great four wins over Boston All
Sabres players contribute to those great wins but those talent players
including Mogily Fuhr Kemhlev and Lafontin impressed me most Their 
skills showed the art of sport not like the garbage speech from the
coach's corner

Reading through most of these hockey news I don't see many Ranger fans writing   

We're here talking about hockey  We don't go away like some team's fans
when the Rangers bite the big one

Yeah I think we're used to it by now even if some of us do change our
sigs to root for our second favorite teams 


I'm new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering
Ranger  fan  But remember suffering builds character

I don't care  I want my fcking Stanley Cup  Before I die  AARGH

I'll be happy if they win it before I get out of school the way it's going
I may be here saying Piled Higher and Deeper before long



Ranger fans may be suffering but we're some of the most loyal unlike Islander
fans who only show up when the team wins
This has been observed many times  It's true definitely

I have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement
but
by far the worst band  wagon fans are the PIT fans at least at the present
Case in Point  I know a guy who just came to Hockey HellTM from Pitt U
Him  How 'bout the Pens The're Fing awesome
Me  Yeah but beating up on the Devils doesn't mean alot Wait until
	they meet Boston andor Detroit in the Playoffs start
Him  When do the Playoffs start
Me  Uhhhh They started a week ago

I'm not saying that this is true of all the Waddlers fans but there seems to 
be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except
that they're newly beloved Waddlers are the best team in the game right now
and when they're not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork

As far as the Stanley Cup goes I think there's only one team that can test
Pittsburgh and that's Detroit  This would be the most entertaining and hard
fought series  Mario is amazing

I'm just wondering where all the Bruins fans are  I mean they woofed it
up with about  posts during the regular season saying that their
fave team was going to kick everyone's  in the playoffs and win the Stanley
Cup  While I see nothing wrong with a little ranting and raving I'm just
curious why all the Boston faithful have stopped posting  I mean I haven't
even see just one little Boston fan post 'cept for the Bruins fans that
aren't cocky  Well maybe they're all out on the golf course or something
but I don't know I'd sure like to see where all those Bruins fans are at 

Still here Just doing a little sobbing in our beer so we're to busy to
post 

Seriously I think I caught a sig curse from Nelson 
First the  Rangers and  now the B's

Add Boston's WEEIAM as the Bruins' flagship station You probably won't
pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a  watt
station The Bruins also have network stations in all  New England
states

This could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an
allsports radio station The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy
being moved over to a different stationWMEX AM whenever there
is a the samenight conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics This happened
 times during the course of the regular seasonThe Celtics own financially
troubled WEEI The Bruins might resurface on WHDH  next year Stay
tuned

I am sorry to tell you this but
I don't think the devils will win
a game against Pittsburg the 
Penguins have so many scoring threats
that you shut down one and another
will kill you
It's too bad but I must conclude that the Penguins will

so all us hockeyautomobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand
	ESPN delays the martinsville race by a day for the NFL draft
	ESPN shows baseball instead of the overtime of a NHL playoff game
 
	gimme a break guys


What really irritated me was that they kept switching back and forth
between baseball and hockey after they stated that they couldn't show
the overtime period I turned back to ESPN around  and it was hockey
Great I pulled up a chair and watched then the first overtime period 
ended and they went back to baseball before coming back to hockey
something like  minutes later Are they trying to alienate both
hockey and baseball viewers at the same time As for Martinsville
I wonder why they even bothered to sign up for it when they it was
no secret that it coincided with the draft Why not let TNN broadcast
it

Wood played most of his junior career in Seattle  He was one
of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
  He rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
the WHL

Wood is fairly small for an enforcertype I mean Fleury does a pretty good
job and isn't that large but Dody is no Fleury 

Having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup he simply isn't
ready to fight at an NHL level assuming that it's his role which is ALL he
really showed us in his few games up from KC  if he can pass shoot or
skate I never saw much of it All he has is a right fist which isn't bad
but at the NHL level the other players are smart enough to grab the thing
before he can land anything significant Once you control that hand he's a
fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything
he wants to him His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach
until he found an opening  and I never once saw him find an opening worth
talking about He got neutralized quickly and stomped on a couple of times

Unless he shows some new tricks in camp he'll be on my career minor
leaguer list Since this was his first taste of the NHL I expect the
Sharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on offseason He
needs to get stronger he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some
versatility as something else than a simply goond because he wasn't
particularly good as a goon

In four of the five games Finns have played the goalie has been chosen
the best player of the opposing team In the fifth the finnish goalie 
Ketterer was elected the best Finn Has this to do with the goalies 
having good days in these games or are the finnish players just lousy
scorers

Anyway quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally
the exception of course being Canada vs Italy  It looks like the
goalies are getting too good  Is this due to their equipment getting
bigger so they cover more their gloves eg seem to be much bigger
now than they were some years ago

Anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way

Wayne made his own bedchoosing McNall over Sather and hockey
destinyhe should sleep in it instead of whining  Ego got

Absolute nonsense  The decision that was made was Pocklington's  He chose 
 mill over Gretzky  If Gretzky wasn't upset about not being able to win
a cup in LA then I submit that he wasn't worth the  mill

the best of himhe thought the supporting cast in Edmonton
didn't matterthat he was the show himself

How do you know what he thinks or thought  The only thought that I
can see that you have revealed is your own  You don't like Gretzky
Big deal

Now my only complaint about Lemieux is that he dives too much
but last year Patrick convinced him twice to accept Bowman and hockey
destiny rather than his ego

The real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty  What
the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the
ref won't be fooled  I can't imagine why anyone would expect someone like
Lemieux to change his game  Why don't you pick on  dimensional overrated
type like Hull and Salami

Anyone interested in catching the games from Nassau
Coliseum hopefully there will be another can catch
the game at North Carolina's Original Sports Bar in
Chapel Hill  I'm pretty sure they carry HTS as well
They had all three games on at the same
time last night  This is the only place I know to
catch all of the Stanley Cup action

I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack
of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils Actually
I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved However I am going to put an end
to nonPIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens Man they
are killing those Devils worse than I thought Jagr just showed you why
he is much better than his regular season stats He is also a lot
fo fun to watch in the playoffs Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of
fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final
regular season game          PENS RULE

 By the way I am Canadian play a little and watched
 Hockey night In Canada Never Missed a Show

Well that's really great Pat  I guess since you've played a little you thereby 
qualify as an expert  Especially since you watch all the games on tv  All 
that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato

 Not that I condone violence but I'll make an exception for Mario
Pat Walker

Again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are  Truly a 
stupid statement  Mario is definately one of the best players to play the game
I'm not saying he is the best to ever play the game but he should come to
mind when that question is asked  Let's face it he just returns from 
radiation therapy with around a dozen games left overtakes Lafontaine for the
scoring lead and then buries him  No I guess he just got lucky
Speaking of Lafontaine now there's a guy who should be considered for the
Hart trophy as well certainly one of the better players in the league this
year

I'm a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best I can
here in the hockey hinterlands Oklahoma  I'm hoping I can get a
reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas

I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of or possibly
THE hockey state in the US  So why is the team moving to a city in
Texas  Is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or
were the Stars really not making a profit  Or was the city or whoever
owned the arena doing some price gouging

As much as I'd like to see the NHL only a  hour drive from me I
can't help but feel for the people in Minnesota unless they truly
didn't support the team  

Opinions please

 Switzerland beat Sweden in a WC for the first time since  and the Swiss
 now have a small chance of reaching the quarterfinals if Austria beats
 Italy tonight

 The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop
 pass at his own blue line and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat
 Tommy to the stick side The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald
 was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy
 to make it   was a nice one Howald entered the Swedish zone slammed
 on the breaks and his shot went in by Tommy's far post One of the lousiest
 periods I've seen Sweden play this year
 Second period saw a new Swedish team and the Swiss had to ice the puck many
 times On a pp Nylander skated in from the boards Pavoni made the initial
 save but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound  Then a power play goal
 from the Swiss a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way
 to the goal and past Soderstrom also Jonas Bergqvist made it  after a
 nice pass from Naslund behind the goal Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 
 just before the end of nd period on a pp skated in unattacked in front of
 the goal and put the puck through Pavoni's hole 
 Third period Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled
 through Pavoni's hole Then another defensive mistake by the Swedes
 Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close
 range could make it  Hollenstein then scored  on a on break away
 and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom

 Russia probably made their best game of the tourney but yet there wasn't
 enough to win against the effective Canadians

 Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post and Dineen just
 deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal Then a power play
 goal after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the
 far post and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov
 Russia won the shots in the first period  and they had the most of
 the scoring opportunities but they just couldn't score
 Second period saw Lindros scoring his th  goal of the WC Kariya
 entered the Russian zone slammed on the break to get past his defenseman
 then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to
 deflect it to Lindros who onetimed the puck
 The Russians then finally got their goal Karpov broke in from the side
 and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner
 
 Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya and for Russia Valeri
 Karpov I agree the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya and
 in part also Tugnutt Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes
 and he was very impressive Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros
 after Mike Gartner went out with a ribinjury early in the first period

 Lindros BTW lead the point scoring with  pts  before this game
  pts ahead of the next player ie double as much as the next player
 among those Kariya with  Amazing

Have the rules for goalies' equipment changed It seems that eg glove
has become bigger and bigger all the time and pads too and the goalies are
wearing over size jerseys Am I dreaming If you watch old photos or
films let say about ten years back I think the difference is quite obvious
Who is an expert on this please let me know Or have the goalies become
bigger

Jarkko  trouble in scoring

Game  report deleted
it bad ref'ing won't affect this
 series which should only go two more games all things being equal

Wrong

The Kings just put on an exibition of hustle team play and consistent 
pounding and took it back to Calgary with the series tied at  games each
The final score was  with the third goal an emptynetter at  of
the third Conacher

This is not an official game report just my observations from the stands

 Melrose made a wise decision and put Stauber back in goal Robb had
   something to prove and he did in stopping  of  while facing a 
   fierce Calgary attack There were numerous 'highlight film' saves

 Kings third and fourth lines rose to the occasion playing rough while
   avoiding bad penalties Warren Rychel scored the gamewinner early in the
   second period Rookie defenseman Alexi Zhitnik scored the first from the 
   blue line late in the first


 Dave Taylor is awesome He suffered a broken nose partway through the
   second pariod checked from behind into the boards by Roberts who got
    and a game He came back late in the third and was on the ice when
   Conacher scored the empty netter 

Actually it was in the third period his return did bring a spark to the
crowd and to the players who played awesome defense in the third


 The Kings goto guys still are not producing No goals from Kurri Granato
   Sandstrom or Robitaille who have a total of  points between them 

You forgot about Gretzky  If any of these guys start scoring the Kings
will be unstoppable if they continue the great defensive work as well


 McCreary sucks He called McSorely for high sticking someone who was already
   on the ice and Sandstrom for high sticking when he himself was already on
   the ice He missed many flagrant stick penalties including one from Flame
   goalie Jeff Reese who followed Granato out to almost the blue line where he
   crosschecked him He called the game very inconsistently with a series of
   tickytack penalties in the first and almost none in the third Can't the
   NHL supply decent officiating

 I was sitting directly across the ice from Ron and Nancy Reagan When the
   empty netter was scored Nancy leapt out of her seat with both fists high
   in the air Way to go Nancy


This series is still too close to call Tuesday's game may be the deciding
one I expect King might put Vernon back in even though Reese had two good
games in LA Reese has historically been good in LA This was only the second
time he lost there This move would be good for the Kings since Vernon is 
such a sieve I am sure that Stauber will get the call for the Kings

Stauber will be in net on Tuesday  Hopefully he will provide another
stellar performance and earn the name Robb Stopper Stauber


The firswt two lines of the Kings have to wake up While it is great to see
you cannot depend on Pat Conacher and Warren Rychel for all of your offense
I expect Sandstrom Granato and Gretzky might be put back together on a line
like they were early in the season This would leave Kurri Carson and Luc
as the second On paper these two lines look powerful Let's see if they
can make it real

I believe this is how they areI know it is Gretzky and Sandstrom but he
has been putting a number of people on left  Also the Carson Robataille
Kurri line once ignited will light the fire of the other lines
Hopefully

GO KINGS

dvb




It is evident that the scoring drought is getting to Luc after his slight
breakaway in the third I think he was steamed on the bench this emotion
might help him break his streak  Also I have noticed Blake has had a few
really good chances to score but has fanned or shot wide  Is the injury
still affecting him

 ovan nmnda problem med norrgruppen men Vstervik r det
 mnne fr att Nykping skall slippa spela i sder vilket

 kom a i stra kvalet
 
 Kommentarer

Att man skulle bli tvyngen att ndra premisserna kunde man inte lista
ut p frhand Huvudsak att man inte flyttar ner fel lag
stersund var en solklar fix som sagt men Vstervik Att det beror p
Nykping tror jag inte p man kunde ju lika grna flytta ner Roma
till sdra iaf om man gr efter bredgraderna Mest rttvist vore att
lta Tierp och Vstervik gra upp men d skulle RomaNykpinks vara
eller inte vara i stra ocks avgras Vad skulle de sga om det
Det strsta felet med rets indelning r exakt samma som frra ret
fast vrre DET R INTE RTVIST INDELAT sportligt sett Vallentuna var
en match frn att g upp till Allsvenskan frra ret istllet gick 
Gvle upp Tror ni nn av dem lyckas lika bra i r
AIK HIF SSK och HIK ska slss om tv platser Om man hadde placerat
dessa i var sin division skulle de vara sjlvklara favoriter till en
plats i Allsvenskan men nu mste tv ge vika Var finns rttvisan i det
 Jag har hrt att HIK har lmnat in en protest till frbundet angende
indelningen i stra
Mitt frslag vore att lta orna i varje division kvalspela om tv
platser i Allsvenskan och efter jul skulle man kunna sl ihop de fyra
divisionerna till tv en sder och en norr P s stt bestraffas inte
ett lag som kommer frn en trakt dr det finns mnga bra lag

En kul grej som jag nskar att man infrde r att lta vinnaren i
Allsvenskan f spela i SMslutspelet Det skulle bli en extra krydda till
division ett ishockeyn om lagen knde att de var inom rckhll till
SMbucklan Det skulle kanske p sikt ocks kunna minska skillnaderna
mellan lag i elitserien och division ett Vad sjs

I'm not even going to bother to reply to your ranting post the letter is 
addressed to Gary Bettman not you He can reply as he wishes

Not so  Your post is addressed to all  I quote

As she said the letter is addressed to Bettman  The post which though
having pretty much the same content is an entirely different entity was
addressed to all  When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will
say To All  I figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it
since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here  That's an entirely 
different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman

Unfortunately

And I guess I let you know didn't I

You do NOT represent a large body of hockey fans by any standard you care
to use to define large   people constitutes nothing more than a tiny 
group of fanatics and is in no way representative of a large body of hockey
fans on the Internet let alone of one of the largest computer networks in 
the world 

The largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of 
the Internet not a group as a whole that she claims to represent  As
for the business of whether or not it is large it is large compared
to say the number of folks on rsh who are sending a letter to thank
him for changing the names at least to this point  And just for my
own curiosity I thought I'd look up the official definition of large
in the dictionary  It reads

large    having more than usual power capacity or scope    
          exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size

Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue
or how many people may have signed them   people may be up there 
thereby validating definition   I would also wager that the geographical
range of signatures is quite large which would give it a large scope

He might be impressed by the size of the list of names

Why would he be impressed with this unless it were large 

I am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing
and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear
yourself speak  

I personally don't know whether or not I agree with the letter  I have
very mixed emotions about it  I like the names as they are and don't
think they make it that difficult to learn the game but there might be
a shred of validity to the change

Again I assume this is not just flame bait by Roger but actually a
truly held opinion  

In article Aprramseycslaurentianca maynardramseycslaurentianca Roger Maynard writes
I would say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of
a group that I belong to  And I don't share those views  And I don't
believe that the majority of posters on rshockey share those views 
And so I have no intention of allowing them to simply go ahead without
making my feelings on the subject clear

Thanks  For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important
enough to say something themselves  

I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the
views of a group that you belong to  It represents a subset that you
don't belong to of a larger group which you do if only because this
isn't a moderated group

Look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint  Three
that come to mind are as follows

 Say it subtly  Result it may not be clear
 Say it directly yet politely  Result probably it will spark some 
   interesting conversation
 Say it directly and obnoxiously  Result validity goes right out
   the window

I would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature

You realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be
used against you

He's been out but he isn't injured  He played well when he was put into the lineup at the end of the season  Murray has to sit somebody out though  If the Red Wings hadn't played as well as they did in the first game he may have been in the second  Why should Murray juggle players when the Wings are dominating Toronto like they are

Wood played most of his junior career in Seattle  He was one
of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
  He rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
the WHL
 
 Wood is fairly small for an enforcertype I mean Fleury does a pretty good
 job and isn't that large but Dody is no Fleury 

And Fleury is no enforcer An agitator for sure but Fleury never has and never
will have a fight which seems to be what you're saying Wood is 

The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against
Los Angeles There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under his
arm Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the
head McSorely knowing a good thing when he saw one popped Fleury one right
between the eyes End of fight Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble

The only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning and even then
he'd be giving up two inches and  pounds

John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his AllMadden team
a lot over much better receiversfor much the same reasons Cherry
sings the praises of Doug Gilmoura little guy with heartyet one
doesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has
lost his marbles

Maybe because John Madden doesn't pretend that his AllMadden team is the
team of the best players  Maybe because John Madden doesn't feel the need
to denigrate players he doesn't choose for his AllMadden team  Maybe
because Madden actually demonstrates some knowledge about football when he
broadcasts a game

 
 Don Cherry doesn't denigrate players except those who dive showboat
 wield their sticks as weapons while hiding behind visors or
 deliberating attempt to injure or aggravate the injuries of others

Not always true In fact in the case of Doug Gilmour he actually praises them

Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion Canadian kids
that do them are tough just like a real Canadian 

Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head Doug
Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming 
Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot Most likely the latter

I used to like Don Cherry I thought he was great But I'm starting to see
his true colors redneck and the more I see of them the more I think he's
just an asshole

 I don't think the Sharks should dig into the free agent market  Most of
 the good free agents will require quite a bit of compensation and set the
 Sharks back as far as player development goes remember the Sharks were
 unwilling to give up players in addition to the  million they offered for
 Joe Murphy and I think that's a good approach  They tried to sign Sergei
 Makarov before this season because Makarov wouldn't have required compensation

Matching the Makarov offer was the only real mistake Dave King has made this
year I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a year old who
is obviously on the downside of his career to a year  million contract 
Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last
quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain
stinks Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself
into position to make the nifty passes 

I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees
to pay his contract He's ineffective in Calgary but he might be able to help
a team like San Jose with their shortage of talent If there's no takers and
Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp I think the Flames will just
bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him With his
current attitude he is a detriment to the team

 When you think of the NHL who comes to mind Gilmour Gretzky Mario
  ah did I mention Mario If you said Gretzky you haven't really
 been following along have you If you said Gilmour you are a true
 Maynard 
 
 I don't even think the selection of the HArt deserves serious discussion on
 this group It is a nobrainer

While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart it is far from a nobrainer 
The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team not to the best
player in the league So your above arguement is really worthless 

The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team The Leafs without 
Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the rd pick 

Like I said Mario deserves it IMHO But it is a very close race and a 
Gilmour victory would not surprise me I dislike Doug Gilmour with a passion 
but I must concede that he is extremely valuable to the Leafs

 I for one am happy about the Ranger's hiring of Keenan  It's too bad  
that they
 didn't hire him when Smith fired Nielsen maybe he could of staightened  
out the
 babies on this team and made the playoffs  What this team needs is a  
little
 fire under their butts
 
 Reading through most of these hockey news I don't see many Ranger fans  
writing   
 I'm new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering  
Ranger
 fan  But remember suffering builds character
 
 I have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that  
last
 dreadful stretch
 
  Knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didn't we  
see Mike
 Hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when Leetch first  
went
 down
 
  Why is Joe Kocur playing every night  He is not Bob Probert  
who is
 tough but also can play
 
  How come Paul Broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of  
the
 season  At least he plays with some heart and character draws  
penalties and
 plays  when he's on the ice  Was he in the doghouse for some  
reason
 
  Joe Cirella  Enough said
 
 Ranger fans may be suffering but we're some of the most loyal unlike  
Islander
 fans who only show up when the team wins
 
 As far as the Stanley Cup goes I think there's only one team that can  
test
 Pittsburgh and that's Detroit  This would be the most entertaining and  
hard
 fought series  Mario is amazing
 
 Kurt

I think Joe Kocus should play every night   He is a big physical guy and  
he gets the fans into the game with some big hits  both checks and  
fists  Its a big advantage to get the crowd going  Plus he helps  
protect the other players  Notice there are very few fights when Kocur is  
on the ice unless he is it  I have seen people start to go after essa  
Tikkanen only to go slinking away when Kocur steps in  I think he is big  
asset but should be third line and special situation only play

Acquired	C Marcus Thuresson from N Y Islanders
For		RW Brian Mullen
Grade		I BC

It is not known yet what the impact overall of this trade would be as
Thuresson is not yet under contract to the Sharks and does not appear to be
ready to become so anytime soon  Mullen meanwhile has had a productive
somewhat season with the Islanders  Thuresson however does not appear to
be a big scorer at all if my memory is right he had just  points in just
 games in the Swedish elite league in '  This season I didn't notice
his name frequently at all in Staffan's reports and he didn't make the
national team either it does not appear to be a good sign

 Marcus Thuresson had  goals  assists  points and  PIM in  games
 this season for Leksand in the Swedish elite league This was only th
 in point scoring for Leksand

 Marcus born May   Ht  cm Wt  kg is relatively young so he
 might still start producing but I think the Sharks may have done a bad
 trade here

Like many others I too was watching the CapsIsles game when the went

Anyway  us BLUES and Hawks fans got shafted worse  While everyone
in the US and watched the game on ABC  However those of us who live in
the central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus
Telethon  The area that was most affected by the telecast did not get
to see the game except through HAWK VISION  This game had it been
televised would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the area
since   This television BULL has got to stop  We are not only
being deprived of seeing games due to skyrocketing ticket prices but
we are also being deprived of watching them on TV

I'm familiar with the telethon situation an individual on CompuServe
was also victimized and was equally pissed  That was a local
television station contract which could not be broken  For that item
I strongly suggest you call that affiliate and vent your anger on
them  Supposedly one station had told my friend that they have
received hundreds of angry calls which will translate into far less
incentive to preempt hockey telecasts in future  The contract was
written when the pathetic WLAF was in that time slot

The thing that confuses me most about ESPN is that they decided to show the 
Penguins and Devils again on Thursday night  Being that both of the first 
two games were dominated by Pitt you would think that they would show a 
different game  This is in addition to the fact that they should show other 
games just for the sake of fair exposure

NESN owns the rights to Bruin telecasts  I suspect that NESN was only
going to sell one telecast to ESPN remember ESPN only owns exclusive
rights to the FINALS not the entire playoffs  Since ESPN bought the
SCA contract there are less wrangles to untie with showing the Devils
and Penguins


Also some of you should know that as far as I can tell ESPN is not going 
to show Campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds  I 
believe that they are only going to show Campbell games in the first two 
rounds as those series wear on games    or perhaps games    


I think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it  Plus they
have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule
unless the NHL was willing to make a western club move up their game
I think the NHL got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for ABC

Also does anyone have info on ABC coverage for this Sunday 



Same exact coverage as last week  PitNJ game  in the east ChiStL
in the central LACgy in the mountains and west

Of course Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal
contributions before he was fired so it's not clear that this would have
been different  Besides they were marginal contributors

Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came THIS close to trading Kelly
Kisio which if the rumors I've heard are true was over the strong
objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do
with both his ouster and the threeheaded consensus oriented GM

Imagine for a second where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine
hadn't jammed

On the other hand I'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes
Fereirra made  Imagine indeed but then again we have the benefit of
hindsight

Let's say that in the view of the Sharks' upper management the attempt
to trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra
I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view  they should have kept
himhe's obviously the luckiest man in hockey  Wonder what
sacrifice he made to the Muse of Fax  His job I guess

 Who should get the Hart
 Gretzky not in a million years  At least not this year
   He hasn't played all year
 Yzerman though it would be nice I don't think he'll get it he's
  consistent but not well known  Thought he should be
 Mario  Jesus NO  It's bad enough for me just to utter the word
  without being extremely sick and pissed off  They guy's a luber
 I think he should become a stuntman after he retires  Jeez he ha
 s enough expericene falling down  Oope  Stick didn't come anywhe
 re near me gotta fall got to get a penalty against the other
 team  It's the annual whineathon with today's host Jerry
 Lewis  By the way I am Canadian play a little and watched
 Hockey night In Canada Never Missed a Show not one of these
 Well a my home team is in the finals and I was a hockey fan for
 ten minutes now Give me a fking break with this Mario is the
 best player ever  What  Did Gretzky die  I wish Bobby Clarke
 and the Broadstreet Bullies were still around they'd know what
 to do with a whouse like Mario
 They'd bounce him around like the puck
 Not that I condone violence but I'll make an exception for Mario
 But if Mario is going to complain about being hit someone should
 give him and Scotty something REAL to complain about
 Sorry to ramble  As you can see I hate Mario

You along with Mario Lemieux must be from another planet  The only
difference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo Washington Abe
Lincoln and many other great men and women of this world whereas you come
from the one with David Koresh  Yeah Mario is good at drawing penalties
but wouldn't you try do something you do claim to play to give your team
an advantage  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this
year whereas many others did  Finally Mario has NEVER complained about
being hit  He knows it's part of the game he gets back by dishing out an
even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals or setting
them up  Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so
much in his life

That's not inner calm  It's boredom and it's being spoiled  The Arena's
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just
take winning for granted  It's been seemingly forever since the team
lost and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and
surprise at victory

I don't really agree with this  But it is an entirely different high
at any rate  The first Cup the Pens won I didn't think about anything
else I just watched Mario and all skate the thing around the ice  Now
it seems to be more of a question whether or not thirty years from now
young hockey fans may there be millions will still ask us what it was
like to watch this team  That's what they are playing for now  But I
was still as nervous as ever when the Devils were blasting shots at
Barrasso in the final seconds of game three so the fun is far from over
yet

I'm not bored either  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup
was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one
But I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm
to which Susan originally referred  Inner calm is not boredom

As far as the arena in general being boring well Richard's got that right
It's been that way all season  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who
just don't have the same spirit and knowledge as longtime fans  At
last Tuesday's game I overheard a man express surprise that a
goaltender can get an
assist

Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen
at any time  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to
think for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out
of this series  I doubt that will happen but it's possible  Bored  Uhuh
Spoiled  Not in the least  Forgot what excitement is like  Living through
that amazing streak wasn't exciting  I don't take a darned thing for
granted  God look at Chicago

And I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway  It isn't gonna
last forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can

As for the picks
Ottawa picks  which means it is almost  that Alexander Daigle will 
go  He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec

I dunno about hat I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that
Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger Daigle has
shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked
and after coming back from his second multigame suspension for being
stupid he's really tanked in his performance His stock is dropping like a
rock 

Also remember that a lot of teh draft st stuff comes from the assumption
he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects It's not clear that 
Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current
status He's still first round but I don't consider him a first pick lock
by any means at this point

It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his
signing price since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos
suspensions

IMO I would
take Kariya  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team

San Jose will then get Kariya

No Kariya won't go in the first three for a very simple reason he's not
leaving college and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to
use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two not
when there is equally good or almost as good stuff available that can make
an immediate impact San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards
Niedermayer for that reason Kariya could go th or th unless a team can
convince him to leave school early which I doubt


My cut on things as they stand today

Draft Order

 Ottawa  Daigle if not  Pronger
 San Jose  Niedermayer unless Ottawa skips Daigle Then it's open
	it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him I don't
	believe they draft him to keep him
 Tampa Bay whoever Ottawa doesn't take or maybe Koslov

Gaetz won't be back There's been rumors he was officially released right at
the end of the season when his contract expired but I haven't seen
confirmation It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he
wasn't going to make it for a while and the Sharks would have to sign him
to a contract which given his problems competing at the IHL level this
spring doesn't make sense

Is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad  I
can't remember how many times during the PenguinsDevils game they showed some
guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being
fired on goal  In fact I think they even missed one goal completely because
they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner

Now the last time I watched a football game they didn't show the lineman going
at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown     

Is it just me	

Greg


ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the
followthepuck concept of televising hockey games  One of the main
problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything
that is going on  more happens away from the puck than in any other
sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players
to be shown between plays

The problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile
other times you get burned

 One last point Darryl Sutter is getting badly out coached by Bob Berry  The
 madder Darryl gets the more he reminds me of Brian  The Hawks are
 quickly loosing thier focus I don't think the Blues will win in  but you
 never know

Not to Sutter bash or anything since I idolized them as players
you sure would think the Sutters would learn something about burning out their
teams in the regular seasonjust too much intensity during the regular 
season  I earlier posted a note about Brian and got to thinking after I read
this itemgee both Sutters won their divisions and now both have lost 
home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the
playoffs  Kind of makes you wonder

Bottom lineman it is great to be smoking the WartHawks
Agreed Jimthis has been damn sweet so far  About the only thing
that comes close to this is shutting up all the Maple Laugh fansDetroit
has completely kicked their asses so far  But I will stick with the
Blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far

With the recent demise of the Chicago Blawkhawks much to my delight I
noticed their   game playoff losing streak  to the Pens last year and
now  to the Blues and I am wondering what the NHL record for consecutive
losses is if there even is one

I'm pretty sure that the Hawks have at least a  game losing  streak since
they've had to have lost a series since their last championship whenever that
was

Basically I need something else to rag on my Hawksfan friend with

i'm not going to bother reprinting your pathetic excuse for a post Mario

hart trophy i guess winning the scoring title after being out twentyfour  
days with CANCER then leading his team to the presidents trophy and  
breaking the win streak record in the process shouldn't even qualify him  
for the award maybe next year he'll tend a few games when barrasso needs  
a rest be realistic mario has earned every one of his accolades and  
deserves all the attention that he gets lose the jealous attitude and you  
may start enjoying hockey at its finest

 I for one am happy about the Ranger's hiring of Keenan  It's too bad  
 that they
 didn't hire him when Smith fired Nielsen maybe he could of staightened  
 out the
 babies on this team and made the playoffs  What this team needs is a  
 little
 fire under their butts
 
 Reading through most of these hockey news I don't see many Ranger fans  
 writing   
 I'm new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering  
 Ranger
 fan  But remember suffering builds character
 
 I have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that  
 last
 dreadful stretch
 
  Knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didn't we  
 see Mike
 Hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when Leetch first  
 went
 down
 
  Why is Joe Kocur playing every night  He is not Bob Probert  
 who is
 tough but also can play
 
  How come Paul Broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of  
 the
 season  At least he plays with some heart and character draws  
 penalties and
 plays  when he's on the ice  Was he in the doghouse for some  
 reason
 
  Joe Cirella  Enough said
 
 Ranger fans may be suffering but we're some of the most loyal unlike  
 Islander
 fans who only show up when the team wins
 
 As far as the Stanley Cup goes I think there's only one team that can  
 test
 Pittsburgh and that's Detroit  This would be the most entertaining and  
 hard
 fought series  Mario is amazing
 
 Kurt
 
 I think Joe Kocus should play every night   He is a big physical guy and  
 he gets the fans into the game with some big hits  both checks and  
 fists  Its a big advantage to get the crowd going  Plus he helps  
 protect the other players  Notice there are very few fights when Kocur is  
 on the ice unless he is it  I have seen people start to go after essa  
 Tikkanen only to go slinking away when Kocur steps in  I think he is big  
 asset but should be third line and special situation only play
 
 
 
This is fast becoming a game without the goons  I admit Kocur may get the
fans into the game but surely they would rather see Broten taking a pass from
Kovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the Rangers up  magic  goals in
the third period rather than seeing Kocur take another stupid penalty and the
Rangers giving up another powerplay goal 

The Rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off
Messier and the first line  Nemchinov is a perfect third line center

So who goes Beezer or Richter

 	Rumor has it here in Pittsburgh that there is going to be a Penguins
 broadcasting change before next season  According to the rumor the KBL
 leadership the company the broadcasts the Pen's games wants to limit
 loved broadcaster Mike Lange to radio only and hire Don Cherry as his
 broadcast partner  This would mean Paul Stiegerwald would be fired
 good riddance   
 
 	Does anyone know anything about this  Lange is a fun broadcaster to
 listen to and Pens games wouldn't be the same without him  Also I hear
 Cherry doesn't have high opinions of Lemieux Ulf Sammuelsson or
 Jaromir Jagr  How is he supposed to broadcast their games
 
     I believe that the large number of digits on his paycheck and
it would not be binary would help Don to be a fan of Ulf Jaro and
Mario

I'm personally expecting Moog  Blue played fairly decent alright
spectacular at times in his  a game but Moog has the experience
What Did Blue have going for him nothing What would happen in a Tie
game the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep the
puck out at the very least until your team scores  Blue didn't face that
kind of pressure on Tuesday  The Bruins will come out storming that
is for sure  I really think that this series is up to Buffalo Boston
except for two bad passes in game one really hasn't played that bad
  As a believer is statistics you know that your going to get the
puck by fuhr sooner or later just keep shooting  There game plan is
sound but they need to take the lead first and control the tempo

               IMHO

The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere

  Gerald look at what happened to the Stars they are off to Dallas


Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is
because he is at the moment of maximum advantagethe provincial
government is months away from a provincial electionit is
the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands
to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price
and it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with
the players which might involve some enhanced revenuesharing

Gerald the Alberta election is slated fou  June unless something REALLY goes 
wrong this time  Pocklington could end up being THE embarassment of Klein
if he goes ahead with his 'ultimatum'


Pocklington is many thingsstupid is not one of them

Gerald  people still have an axe to grind with this guy  I CANNOT see him staying for long

He can dictate termsbecause other cities will pay his
price if Edmonton doesn't

But the people in Edmonton won't budge trust me on this one

Edmonton has already  up its international airport and
surrendered supremacy to Calgary and over the next few years
Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks
It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find
a way to lose its hockey team toobecause Northlands wants
to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing

Northlands won't budge ccording to one of the board members Bruce Campbell

However in this case about the longterm financial
viability of the Oilers the fact is that Pocklington is basically 
right regardless of who owns the team and it is right to provoke
the crisis now before the team accumulates millions of dollars
in losses or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack
of money

I haven't heard anything BUT attendance at the Coliseum was the lowest this 
year  HINTHINT  Remeber what I said about a personal vendetta

Sather has done his jobthe Oilers are poised to be competitive
again very soon Al Strachan one of the most knowledgeble hockey
writers in Canada in a postmortem of the Oilers season in
the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me

Gerald don't blame Sather  This battle between the peole and Pocklington
started in  and got WORST when Pocklington sold Gretzky  

There were days when you can shake the hand of Pocklington when he was
respectalbe I use to do so in    season  but those days are GOE

Once again the Leafs overcame the Red Wings in what was possibly the
most exciting game played yet in this playoff year  Potvin was solid

Coaching news 
	       Vasili Tichonov exAssat to San Jose Sharks 
Wow  So that's probably the reason why current assistant coach Drew Ramenda
hinted that he won't be back  Thanks for the news Mikko can you or any
of our Finnish netters comment on Tichonov

The first time I heard this piece of news was on the post game radio
interview here in Jyvaskyla That was the bronze medal game in the 
SMliiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat the Aces of town Pori
lost  Vasili the son of Victor Tichonov the famous Soviet coach
said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to
take the assistant coach post But he wants to be the head coach where
ever he goes He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore after
three seasons I don't know why

Vasili is a good coach I believe Assat was a good team produced many
players to our national team Assat wasn't a skilled team IMHO but
they had the fighting spirit After all they butchered Jokerit in the
playoffs and gave hard time to TPS the champs But Assat wasn't
consistent only when they were in the right mood they could beat any
team in the SMliiga

I am not  sure about the deal with the Sharks As I said he wants
to be the head coach But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and
decide during the WC I doubt that he will be the head coach but
maybe they'll do some compromise

Could somebody post more information about Vasili I know he was coaching
in the former Soviet league teams results His character as a coach

but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO  Of course
Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either
It seems that he was following the The only way to beat the
Penguins is to injure them philosophy

It's pretty obvious that Holik's hitting Barrasso was an accident He
was even apologizing for it immediately before the Penguins all jumped

Many people have suggested that Fuhr's play is the only reason that the 
Sabres beat the Bruins  While Fuhr was a critical factor I would not 
overlook the fact that the Sabres finally got some scoring from people other 
than Mogilny and LaFontaine Khmylev Sweeney Hawerchuck etc  Indeed 
LaFontaine played hurt and didn't score many goals  Also the team played 
better defense although not great than in the regular season  Fuhr 
deserves a lot of credit but not all of it

Robert A

I agree with this I also think Fuhr's contribution for Sabres's win is just
the same as many palyers in the team Mogilny had six goals in four games
including two goals for the great comeback in the final win after Fuhr had
left The key for Sabres's win over Boston is whole team's strong commitment
as an underdog and all their talent players including Mogilny and Fuhr


I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that
While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well I
still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr the series would
now be tied  He virtually stole games  and  for the Sabres
In both of these games Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres
the chance to win Especially in game  Fuhr made a series of
huge stops in the third period when the score was tied  
Even in game  when the Sabres won  the score seemed to
indicate that the Sabres dominated However if it hadn't been
for Fuhr the Sabres wouldn't have been up  I think it was
through the nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open
up the game thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on
a breakaway to salt away the game  There
is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the
victory 

In my opinion Neely Oates and Juneau played as well as
LaFontaine Mogilny and Hawerchuk The Sabres did get
extraordinary efforts from Hannan Sweeney Wood and Khmylev
compared to that of the Bruins checkers However the Bruins defense
 IMO played better than the Sabres defense the Sabres have Ken Sutton
playing a regular shift afterall 
The difference in the series was Fuhr who outplayed Andy Moog

I'm a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best I can
here in the hockey hinterlands Oklahoma  I'm hoping I can get a
reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas

I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of or possibly
THE hockey state in the US  So why is the team moving to a city in
Texas  Is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or
were the Stars really not making a profit  Or was the city or whoever
owned the arena doing some price gouging

Opinions please


Well as a hockey fan I think it's terrible It's one thing to say Hey 
let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one  that's fine It's
entirely another to say Okay let's take a team from a thriving hockey town
and move it 

Of course none of us will ever know the real inside story but
from what I know a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that
they would purchase the remaining   season tickets to get to the 
level that Green wanted yet he refused every time It's pretty obvious that he
was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets
thing as an excuse 

I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game and
the fans were great People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the
parking lot before the game the attendance was so full as to have SRO and the
whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific Minnesota IS Hockey USA How the
NHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond 
me I only hope they get a new team soon

Just my

I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of or possibly
THE hockey state in the US  So why is the team moving to a city in
Texas  Is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or
were the Stars really not making a profit  Or was the city or whoever
owned the arena doing some price gouging


Norman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years
that he has owned the team  When he bought the team it seemed kind of
obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red
before the team started making a profit again  He gave the impression
that he was willing to do so  He claimed two years ago that the team
needed to average only  fans per game in order to pull a profit
but this season the team averaged  fans despite increasd ticket
prices  I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward
trend which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in
deciding to move  He was even offered the many concessions he rudely
demanded such as guaranteed season ticket sales cheap rent at the
other two arenas in town etc

Oh well I guess the bottom line is   Green wanted immediate huge
returns in Dallas and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN 
Dallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there although I feel
Minnesota's was quite reasonable and he also has some cronies down
there as well  All this means is that Minnesota is without an NHL team
for a year or two  Too bad for the NHL

Read this all you Canucks fan out there
Winnipeg are going to kick Vancouvers butts so badly they are not going to
be able to sit down for weeks
And no this is NOT a joke
A prediction before the fourth game in Winnipeg

Winnipeg  Vancouver   
Selanne Steen score a couple of goals each

Winnipeg to win Stanley cup playoffs


To all you Jets FanaticsHa ha ha
To normal Jets FansIt was a pretty good fourth game More physical
play than I've seen in the first three games

These moronic posts that have continued throughout the year about how
the Jets will cremeate the Canucks and Selanne will smash Bure into the
boards is so full of it Why don't you take a cue fromm Daryl and just
wait 'till its over before you make more of a fool of yourself

I'm not going to predict anything about the Canucks They are up  and
are coming back home but I'm not going swing any it around until the
series is wrapped up

Tony

Bravo Tony

I too am sick of all the mindless fanatical blind faith Jets fans who could 
prpbably predict the end of the world more accurately than the coutcome of a
playoff series

Now I will admit that I am a mindless fanatica blind faith Canucks fan
But unlike those from Winterpeg I do not need to vent my spleen upon the 
world as to how great my team is  I know I have confidence in them and
that's enough

Granted the Jets finished the season hot and the Canucks were having trouble
but Vancouver has built themselves a reputation for being a playoff team  
Just ask any Flames fan  They may not win every series but they alway fight
to the end  I'll admit that last year was not great but if they combine
the work ethic of the past with the new tallent of the present they will
be tough to beat note I did not say they would pummel every team they meet 
and destroy the greatest player playing today

Now like any Canucks fan I would love to see them take the cup  I feel
they have a good chance to make it out of the Smythe and a  shot at
Detroit I can't see them losing to St Louis  If Pittsburgh makes it to
the cup I'd have to put my money on them Yes even if they're facing the
Canucks  If Buffalo Montreal or Quebec beat Pittsburgh I'd choose the
winner of Vancuover and Detroit to take the cup

Oh and one parting note for the Jets fans Just how many times has 
Winnepeg made it to the finals '

Go Canucks

Greg

Devorski unfortunately helped to taint an otherwise brilliant display
by MacLean  The Canucks tied up the Jets so tightly that I thought that
they were mailing them

BTW Gregnext time don't fall asleep in geography class it's pretty
sad when a fellow in Norway can spell Winnipeg properly and a guy in
North America can't

One more thinghow LONG has Vancouver been in the NHL  How many
championships do they have  

Oh yeahand I CAN go to the Arena and see not one not two but
six championship banners hanging from the rafters   Stanley Cup
banners and  Avco Cup banners  My NHL guide says that Vancouver has
won the Cup once as many times as the rockin' town of Kenora has won it

Summary History repeats itself

Okay the Caps AGAIN are about to break out the golf clubs but before they
do does anyone have the history of the Washington Capitals' futility
record in the playoffs I remember that Terry's first year was the first
year that the Caps finally made it to the third round but before under
Brian I noticed that every other year the Caps got to the second round
and the years in between they didn't make it past the first round Is this
trend continuning

In last nights game Toronto received FIVE penalties Detroit none  If


 
 Which game were you watching  Didn't you see the third period when
the Wings had  penalties called on them and then a delayed penalty
The Leafs had a  man advantage for about a minute and a  man advantage
for another minute or two and the Leafs still couldn't score
  And I wonder how the Leafs scored a powerplay goal if according
to you they never had a powerplay
  In the Detroit paper today it said there were  penalties called in
last night's game And you're saying Detroit had none of those penalties
I'm guessing you only watched the first period I have to admitt the Leafs
did get alot of penalties in that period where as the Wings didn't get
many if any at all Haven't looked at the box scores yet  But the
ref more than made up for it in the third period
 
Laurie Marshall
Wayne State University
Detroit Michigan
Go Wings

My apologies for the typo  I meant the Wings had  power plays in the
first period and the Leafs none  

As well my point isn't that the refs were biased just that they were
calling a lot of penalties which works to the benefit of the Wings

Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then
calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away
from what could have been a great game

what did happen to the swiss team  last year they reached the semifinal
and now after  matches no points and even no goals 
after the  against Italy it seems they lost any hope and were
overrun  by the russian team
now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the
Blevel does anybody know if this WC is the qualification tournement for
the olympic games ' in Lillehammer or are some teams already
qualified for them

Hooray I hear on TSN that the Jets have won a game Selanne
getting a hattrick

Of course here in GOD'S COUNTRY read Ontario I couldn't
see that game nor any other in the VANWPG series so far
because our beloved CBC figures no one out here cares about
this series which has looked pretty competitve so far

On Monday and Wednesday nights CBC could have shown the Toronto
Detroit game done the news then picked up WinnipegVancouver
They didn't  Tonight  You guessed it TorontoDetroit the
news not the end of the Jets game then CalgaryLA

SO if it's Hockey Night in Canada why can't this Ontarian see
one of the two series with two Canadian teams  Is this too much to
ask

Paul Badertscher

 I'd like to echo these sentiments  This is the worst coverage I can 
 ever remember seeing on CBC  As soon as the game ends I can count to 
 and by that time they've signed off the air  No post game interviews
 no updating of late scores nothin'  TSN is really putting CBC to 
 shame  I only hope the later round coverage improves I mean who
 really wants to see CBC PrimeTime News instead of hockey

 Once again the Leafs overcame the Red Wings in what was possibly the
 most exciting game played yet in this playoff year

Perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that YOU have seen  For
most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity 
it was nowhere near the most exciting game

Paul Stewart called the single worst game I've seen this year  
Federov's major was obvious and I don't dispute it  However Chaisson's 
penalty shouldn't even have been a penalty let alone a major and a
game misconduct  The minute game misc call is for high sticking only 
There is no blood penalty  Just because  Chaisson barely touched the 
poor sap and he hit the dasher and bled profusely doesn't mean it is a 
penalty 

Unfortunately the instant replay is not used on hits  At first I
immediately thought  and a game because the hit looked much more severe
from an intenttoinjure perspective than it was  After seeing the replay
I'd say it deserved  minutes for boarding it was careless any way you 
slice it  If Stewart had replay I do not think Chaisson would have gotten
 and the game

In the second period behind Potvin Probert had the puck and was
going to get out front and was tackled  I couldn't believe the nocall

This nocall was bullshit I agree I admire Stewart for letting them go but
Probert looked up saying where the hell is the penalty  I've never
seen Probert whine either he doesn't need to  Now if Probie
decides to put Wendel through the boards he's probably gone right

I don't remember who on the Leafs touched the puck 
on Racine's shot towards the end of the game  seconds left but Stewart
called it out of play last touched by Detroit  Everybody in the Garden
including the Linesmen knew it  Yzerman protested but Stewart just 
laughed and really homered the Wings

This was also bullshit  But once again no replay  It was Rouse btw I'm
really pissed that the linesmen didn't correct the call eitherit's bs
when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake  

But when it all comes down to it Wings played like shit

Yes  The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit
loss  I picked the Leafs to win Game  on emotion and adrenalin but the
Wings have no excuses for Game   They should be the superior team

The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting  for putting his
stick in somebody's eye  That was the most dangerous stick infraction I
have seen in a long time and everybody in the damn league knows he's an
asshole when it comes to stickwork  Four lousy minutes  Bullshit call 
Murray should send the tape in  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out
of him

How did the Leafs turn it around 


I couldn't get the Leaf games on the weekend in CA

Did the Leaf defense wise up overnight
Did the Leafs get in the slot or 
was it just fluke goals in a goalie duel 
Did the Wings turn off the jets or muscle  
What gives here

I caught game  on satellite  I figured my Leafs were washed
This is a major turnaround   Very few predicted this 
How how how did it happen   

Wing and Leaf perspectives welcomed

 I've heard rumors recently from reliable sources that Abe Polin the
 moron who owns the Washington Capitals is looking to move the team
 after this season or next  Milwaukee was mentioned as the team's
 potential destination  The person who told me this is strongly
 affiliated with the NHL and has been extremely accurate in the past
 with news of this sort  Does anyone know if this is so or has
 heard anything of the sort  With Baltimore's AHL team gone that would
 leave the area with only an ECHL franchise in Baltimore not good

WHY DCBaltimore is one of the top media markets the only thing the NHL
seems to care about these days they've been doing far better than the NBA
Bullets at the gate for the last five years The team has been a perennial
contender and fan support has been good to excellent    Why should Pollin
move to city that's five times smaller but has as many teams in other pro

	Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway
in world champs After two periods the score was still  This game was 
quite much similar to the first game Finland played  against France
The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky too In the third period
Juha Riihijrvi scored  from a rebound the time was around  mins or so
The second goal was scored by Kari Harila who shot straight from a faceoff
behind the Nowwegian goalie Saku Koivu the yearold center got his first
point of this tournament Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he
was awarded the best player of the game prize Despite the fact that he is
quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater 
I think that we will hear from this guy in the future

having pretty much the same content is an entirely different entity was
addressed to all  When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will
say To All  I figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it
since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here  That's an entirely 
different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman

And it is a damn good thing that she did post it since she claims to represent
people in recsporthockey

Unfortunately

The largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of 
the Internet not a group as a whole that she claims to represent  As

Her sole purpose in mentioning the net as Steve Gallichio has already 
pointed out is to lend weight to her points through association with the
internet  There is no other reason to mention the internet  This is 
misrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation Alison
would be leaving herself wide open to all kinds of civil suits

for the business of whether or not it is large it is large compared
to say the number of folks on rsh who are sending a letter to thank
him for changing the names at least to this point  And just for my

This is not a letter  It is a petition claiming to represent a large
proportion of recsporthockey users and by implication a significant
number of internet users   names can in no way be considered a 
large proportion of recsporthockey which while we have no way of
counting actual readership is accessible to hundreds of thousands of
people   persons is no more than a fly's fart in a windstorm
 
own curiosity I thought I'd look up the official definition of large
in the dictionary  It reads

large    having more than usual power capacity or scope    
          exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size

Gee  You looked up large in the dictionary  What next  Two syllable 
words

Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue
or how many people may have signed them   people may be up there 
thereby validating definition   I would also wager that the geographical
range of signatures is quite large which would give it a large scope

Let me suggest that the only place you are likely to envy the magnitude of 
 is when you are looking for ways to beef up your IQ scores

He might be impressed by the size of the list of names

Why would he be impressed with this unless it were large 

As I said he might be impressed by the size of the list of names  But 
it would have to be considerably larger  But even this definition does
not account for the original context from which you lifted this sentence

I personally don't know whether or not I agree with the letter  I have
very mixed emotions about it  I like the names as they are and don't
think they make it that difficult to learn the game but there might be
a shred of validity to the change  

Well then what the hell is your point  You don't really know if you have
an opinion about the hockey issue but you do know that you don't like me  
Is that it

Amongst Penguins' fans there seems to be an inner calm that I've never
experienced before this year with the Pens The players and the fans have so
much confidence in the team this year We're savoring every game and saving
our energy for the Stanley Cup

That's a good way to put it  It's a quiet confidence  I don't feel like
I have to defend this team anymore 

The Devils are a puzzle to me  They have long been one of the few teams
I always dreaded playing  Their D isn't quite what it used to be but they
still usually play us pretty tough  I just can't figure it out  At least
last night they mounted an attack

	 Watching some of the Devils players being interviewed I could
	   see in their faces and eyes that they really don't have any
	   confidence They are left speechless when asked what more they
	   can to do to beat the Pens They act as though they know it's
	   a hopeless task

Bernie Nichols was interviewed after Game  on the late news  He was
shaking his head in disbelief over Barrasso saying that Tommy is like
another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him
Then he got this faraway look on his face his voice started trailing
off and he said It just isn't rightit just isn't fair and he
tried to muster a smile

I'm really impressed with Bowman's coaching tactics  he's had an answer for
every move that Brooks has thrown at the Pens

As far as coaching goes a PensIslanders matchup should be pretty good

One guy I feel sorry for in all of this so far is Chris Terreri  I'm sure
Tom Barrasso knows how he feels  For so long Tommy would look up and not
have a teammate in sight  Terreri's teammates really left him out in the
cold in the first two games

For the first time all season the Flames are now injuryfree The only player
remaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who even when healthy is not 
a major part of the team 

Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season
game against San Jose He potted his first of the year in that game and has
also scored goals in both Game  and Game  against Los Angeles 

Thoughts on Game 


The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with
Los Angeles  on Sunday afternoon They seemed more interested in throwing
big hits than in scoring goals They physically dominated the Kings but that
was the only area they dominated in The game plan was to rush the net and 
try and take advantage of a young inexperienced LA defence and the shaky
Kings goaltending but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames
conducted a steady march to the penalty box Particularily stupid was Theoren
Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren
Rychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees 

Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the
loss despite his wellpublicized poor record in afternoon games He got
very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and 
sweeping away rebounds In fact Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off
Chris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net 

Thoughts on Game 


The Flames came back strong in the second game evidently aware of the
potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice
The first period was fairly even with the edge going to the Kings But Calgary
came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings scoring
five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a  win 

The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams Calgary
dominated on faceoffs as they did in Game  but they were able to make better
use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one Calgary
also went for on the powerplay while LA only went for and gave up
a shorthanded goal to Joel Otto LA's powerplay goal also came late in the
game with the outcome already decided The Kings' powerplay failed them when
they needed it most in the st and nd periods 

The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he
was leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's th goal Charlie
Huddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury 

The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute First Craig Berube of
Calgary took a fiveminute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for
instigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason Granato
drew a minor for some strange reason Turtling perhaps This was followed
 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major minor and game misconduct
for hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a
fight Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason Hardy and
Yawney went toetotoe and both got double minors Gregson thought that Musil 
turtling amounted to fighting but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at 
each other was just roughing Where's this guy from

So what's stopping Pocklington from going to a bank and borrowing 
million dollars to pay off his Treasury Branch loansI was reading

According to the recent TSN report Peter Puck is not paying any interest
on the Treasury Branch loans  That's a lot of green

somewhere than Pocklington business have gross revenues of about
 million per yearI don't think he would have much problem
borrowing from his VISA to pay off his Mastercard if he wanted to

Again according to TSN virtually everything that Peter Puck has already 
has liens against it  Of course we can't really be sure of this 

Pocklington is at the point of maximum advantage right nowand
he is basically right in that Northlands which is a creature of the
City of Edmonton must give him a better deal in the era of escalating
salaries  Northlands and the city benefitted as much as he did during
the eighties from the Oilersand wealth generated by the Oilers
success was sharedbut the finanical viability of small market teams
has radically changed in the space of a couple of years and for
the Oilers to remain viable and competitive they need much more of
the revenue stream from concessions parking and building advertising
as most every other professional sports franchise in North America
has  What was once a fair agreement that shared the wealth is now
Northlands sucking the blood out of the Oilers franchise

The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is
that a deal is a deal  Sather has spouted this repeatedly  Pocklinton
has a contract with Northlands until   A deal is a deal  Perhaps
if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets players
such as Gretzky and the income he has received in expansion fees with
his revenues he wouldn't be losing money  He has admitted pulling this
money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses 

The Oilers have paid several times over what the Coliseum cost to
build and bring Edmonton prestige and recognition throughout the
world that is essentially pricelessto nickelanddime the Oilers
just so Northlands can use revenue sucked out of the Oilers to 
subsidize their horseracing operations is insanity

I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization  
I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but 
he is certainly not entitled to it  Pocklington has sucked revenue
out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests
Pocklington is not to be trusted  I doubt very much that any Oiler
team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship
As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects
to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or
draft picks

Detroit April 

Most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the Detroit Red
Wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to 
another easy victory over the best team in the NHL 

For the best goaltender in the world Felix Potvin six was a bad number as
he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse
to the goon tactics employed by the inferior Red Wings team

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the NHL
He called a total of  penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques
The Nords' penalty came in OT  Stewart being an exNordique himself
was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murderWE WAS ROBBED

If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's I'd be thanking Stewart for calling
as few penalties as possible Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their
advantage to have a penaltyfilled game where they can clean up with their
superior powerplay 

Montreal really lost that game and game  because Patrick Roy is well on
his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs The man is
truly overrated Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four perhaps five 
were quite stoppable

 What is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus WC
 I know that the Rangers are holding back Kovalev Zubov and Andersson for
 Binghamton but I also know that the Whalers wanted Michael Nylander to play
 for Springfield while Nylander wanted to play for Sweden The Whalers allowed
 the NHL to decide and the NHL chose the WCs How does this differ from the
 Rangers and Oilers Did the Whalers have to go through the league or could
 they have forced Nylander to play in Springfield

As long as a player is under contract to an organization he is obligated to
play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission
to play The Rangers are certainly within their rights to force Zubov and
Andersson to report to Binghampton 

It certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the Ranger 
organization however Is having Binghampton win the Calder Cup really more
important to them than keeping their players happy

And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded 
resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other

Brad McCrimmon was the captain of the Flames when he was traded to Detroit
following the  season This was during the offseason though

There's countless examples of captains being traded I'm sure

I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the
views of a group that you belong to  It represents a subset that you

isn't a moderated group

And you can bet that I wouldn't be the only one not belonging to the
moderated group if it was moderated by an anallyretentive little
dullard like yourself 

Look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint  Three
that come to mind are as follows

I hardly need you to presume to lecture me on how to communicate my points
of view  This posting that you have made is the second on the subject of
the NHL letter and you have yet to communicate your opinion on the matter
Instead you content yourself with flaming me

 Say it directly and obnoxiously  Result

Moronic little busy bodies like yourself take advantage of a perceived
opportunity to post rules for others to live by 

You realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be

Well if using it against me means you are going to post something of

Okay the Caps AGAIN are about to break out the golf clubs but before they
do does anyone have the history of the Washington Capitals' futility
record in the playoffs I remember that Terry's first year was the first
year that the Caps finally made it to the third round but before under
Brian I noticed that every other year the Caps got to the second round
and the years in between they didn't make it past the first round Is this
trend continuning 
This is not a trend The Caps were done Goneso in five games and it saves
us Caps fans a lot of pain

I mean it would be more painful if the Caps were up  watching them 
tumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series How many times
have they done that in their history

 up  in a five game series against the Isles lost  straight
 up  against the Isles lost  straight
 up  against the Pens lost  straight

In other words when they were about to clinch with  games to go they 
were a pitiful  the lone wins being 

 a sweep of Philly in 
 the  win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals the ONLY TIME 
they managed to get out of the division

Actually Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new We all know the Caps
are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games Examples

 game  against the Isles  led  after two lead series 
gave up  goals in the rd period including the game winning goal in the
last minute After that goal Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot
Series tied  lost game  a few days later

 game  against the Rangers  led series  led by  in the rd 
period blew it Lost game in OT and three consecutive games

 game  against Pittsurgh  led series  led by  in nd period
Blew it and the series

 game  against Isles  series tied  led by  after  Blew it

 game  against Isles  trailed series  led by  in nd period
Blew it again

When they were leading by  in game  I said to myself if they blew this
lead the series is OVER They have lost all the momemtum The Islanders
believe they can come back no matter what the score is

I am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team who can 
completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear 
lives in a crucial game

The Admiral a hopeless Caps fan
PS We still remember that  OT loss to the Islanders Aurggghhhhhhhhh
Well some teams such have it and some teams just don't When the Caps
were frustrated year in year out by the Islanders I was thinking wait
until PotvinBossyTrottierSmith retire Well they retired even though
Trottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform yet another
generation of Islanders were still doing the same thing Well I guess 
it has nothing to do with the players

Hi guys

What happened
	  Potvin didn't let six goals by
	  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up
	  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs
		the emotional edge
	  Refs calls especially last night tended to favour Leafs

	A couple of comments

	  On Gilmour  Just because the guy isn't one of the three
	stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team  Someone posted
	the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth
	placeplus he walked away with the Molson cup given for
	accumulating points from the three star selection during the
	regular season

	  On the officiating  I've heard gripes from both ends on this
	one  Emotions are very high in this series  the rivalry is
	one of the stronger ones I know of  I do have to agree that the
	officiating last night was proLeaf in general except for whoever
	missed that slash on Gilmour's hand

	  In general  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better
	chances vs Pittsburgh though I think the Leafs would do better
	against the Bluesbut not as well if they made it out of the
	division Problem is I like both these teams though I'm
	supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle  D

	By the wayGilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not
		playing aggressive hockey
	By the wayI'm not any sort of expert nor do I claim to be
		I just like watching a good matchup


	tee hee heeooops

The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team not to the best
player in the league So your above arguement is really worthless 

Personally I always thought that most valuable to his team was silly
Why should the best player in the league be penalized because he plays on a
team with other good players  Why should a lesser player be picked solely
because he's the best player on a weak team   Wouldn't the weaker team be
helped even more by the best player in the league  Doesn't the presence of
the best player in the league make the other players on the team look
better too

The Hart Trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think
in terms of who was the best player rather in terms of who was the most
valuable to the team  And valuable to his team was not and should not
be considered synonymous with best  We are talking about a time when
honour and attitude not measurable skills were the most important assets
a player brought to his team his league and his sport  This was before
the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was 
formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory

The Hart Trophy is not a prize  It is an honour

While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory I think it must
be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis   
Joseph  When a goalkeeper gets hot there is little an opposing team can do
Joseph should be given the entire city of St Louis because otherwise there 
would probably be a game  scheduled  

As for the game on Sunday  The Blues caught a few breaks without a doubt
One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks looking for reasons to
give them penalties  Second The Blues first goal resulted because the puck
hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear  No linesman no shot
for BrettI can redirect anythingHull to redirect  On another of St Louis'
goals Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone
who didn't belong in the crease which means it was a St Louis player
Finally the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease  No goalie no way to stop the shot

I congratulate St Louis for beating the Hawks  It will be a shame to see
Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph
won't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack

I don't think he's shown that he's good enough to carry Detroit to the Cup
The team may be good enough to reach the finals but Cheveldae is their 
Achilles Heel  You must have goaltending in the playoffs and 
Cheveldae looks like an overmatched nd or rd stringer which he probably
 
 I guess I don't know of too many nd or rd string goalies that could post
 over  wins in a season  Chevy has done that the past two seasons playing 
 behind a defense that is not exactly the best in the league  His  wins 
 this year were not all against Toronto and for those who look at Vincent Rien
 stats and think he should be starting take a look at the teams he played
 against teams like San Jose Ottawa and TB any NHL goalie could post a decent
 record playing teams like that night in and night out
 
is  Look for Detroit management to remedy the situation in the offseason
 
 I really don't see this happening  If they didn't think Cheveldae could do the
 job they would of traded for somebody this year after all why wait until next
 year when there were goalies available this year
 
Hey I may be wrong but after watching him kick rebound after rebound into
the high slot I don't think he can carry them in the tough games ie
those not against Toronto
 
 Better to kick out rebounds than to let goals in

If St Louis gets past Chicago watch for Joseph to carry the Blues past
an otherwise vastly superior Red Wings club

 Joseph is hot but so are the Wings  They have scored six goals in both of
 their games so far with Toronto supposively one of the leagues best defenses
 I guess if they end up playing for the Norris title we'll see what happens

 Wings in ' or hopefully by '


As far as Cheveldae is concerned he is a decent goalie  The most logical
trade in the offseason to me would be between Detroit and NY Rangers  I'm sure
if Beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his
roots in Detroit  He would be a valuable asset to the Wings and Perhaps the
Rangers could get a Zombo in return  Beezer got a few good years in him and
the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play

Summary Montreal wins game  but not without controversy
Keywords Montreal wins a game to get back into the series

  Did anyone see the Montreal  Quebec game yesterday  It was tight right down
to the last second of the third period  In the overtime Roy and Hextall played
like they were gods
  Ok so Montreal won  They deserved it after getting their first goal in
overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick  Their second
goal in overtime was also replayed but I could not tell if it was the Montreal
player who kicked it in  The puck definitely was not directed in by a stick
Anyways Montreal is back into the series

 up with about  posts during the regular season saying that their
 fave team was going to kick everyone's  in the playoffs and win the Stanley
 Cup  While I see nothing wrong with a little ranting and raving I'm just
 curious why all the Boston faithful have stopped posting  I mean I haven't
 even see just one little Boston fan post 'cept for the Bruins fans that
 aren't cocky  Well maybe they're all out on the golf course or something
 but I don't know I'd sure like to see where all those Bruins fans are at

Here in the middle of Connecticut there are plenty of Bruin Fans many who have
let me know in no uncertain terms that the Rangers choked down the stretch  I
think the Bruins are doing the same exact thing the Rangers did they're
playing too tight  Who's responsibility is it to check Mogilny  He has
gotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many rebounds
which are not being cleared by the B's defense  It's too bad the B's might not
get the opportunity to play Pittsburgh again  I would really enjoy seeing

Okay the Caps AGAIN are about to break out the golf clubs but before they
do does anyone have the history of the Washington Capitals' futility
record in the playoffs I remember that Terry's first year was the first

Don't give up so soon  A lot of Burgh fans didn't give up at  last year
You gotta believe  Hard as that may seem  With the Caps with the  power
play in the playoffs and  penalty killing according to Mike Lange all
the Caps have to do is make sure it doesn't go OTas that was Boston's and
Chicago's demise  OT can be a curse

 I'd like to echo these sentiments  This is the worst coverage I can
 ever remember seeing on CBC  As soon as the game ends I can count to 
 and by that time they've signed off the air  No post game interviews
 no updating of late scores nothin'  TSN is really putting CBC to
 shame  I only hope the later round coverage improves I mean who
 really wants to see CBC PrimeTime News instead of hockey

 My 
  Darren

This was a concession to Mansbridge and CBC News they argued that if you're
going to play  havoc with the schedule you should  at least make sure that
Prime Time is aired as soon as possible News got a commitment that the
postgame show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within
one minute or so of the game  ending

As for the earlier comments about CBC being Ontariocentric frankly
the no doubleheader decison goes both ways people in the West cant  see
the Leafs  and people in Central Canada can't see the Jets game The
reason for the decision was CBC's feeling they couldn't sell advertising
for six hours of hockey in  one night

 As for who wants to see news over hockey a lot of people CBC always gets
plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule

There was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams
no matter ow bad they are That's bullshit Anyone who would follow the
Pens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are
losers It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team But
to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck
should not be required of a true fanA  true fan would follow the team in
troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team

When I visit PIttsburgh I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I think
the management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much better
even if they couldn't sign Barry Bonds Lert's say the Pens start doing to
their own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers have
done in recent years I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the
team I'll still follow it and bitch about it But I won't waste my
money on mediocre teams

Oh yeahand I CAN go to the Arena and see not one not two but
six championship banners hanging from the rafters   Stanley Cup
banners and  Avco Cup banners  My NHL guide says that Vancouver has
won the Cup once as many times as the rockin' town of Kenora has won it

Don't let this confuse anybody  The Winnipeg Jets have never won the
Stanley Cup or even come that close  These Stanley Cup championships
go back a LONG way to about the turn of the century  The Winnipeg
Victorias won one or more of these Cups the Jets didn't win any of
them

Can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff
series going on today than who won more Stanley Cups around the turn
of the century

Lets face facts  The Canucks are leading the series   The Canucks
dominated the Jets in their season series  The Canucks did better in
the regular season than Winnipeg  Who is the better team  I think
that the facts show that Vancouver is better than Winnipeg

KBL the Pgh cable sports channel President Bill Craig has

Others being considered for the open broadcasting jobs are current
Pens announcers Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald Craig spoke to
both yesterday KBL's Stan Savaran and Guy Junker ESPN's Mike
Emrick MN broadcaster Doug McCloud and TSN's Jim Hughson

KBL and the Penguins have just inked a new deal giving KBL all 
TV and radio rights to Pens games  Plans are that KBL would like
to have an entire night of hockey starting with a  pregame
show and running to a post game show that would sign off about 
depending upon length of the game

Considering how often and how badly he has slammed the Pens on Coach's 
Corner on Hockey Night in Canada it would surprise me as well  But then

stuff deleted

For example look at Pat Quinn of the Canucks I am not saying
that he is the best GM  merely a better one than Murray  and
one I am very familiar with

He traded
Garth Butcher a good player and Dan Quinn not in the NHL anymore
to St Louis for Cliff Ronning Geoff Courtnall Sergio Mommesso and
Robert Dirk    too good to be true right

I think this goes along with a comment you made in an earlier post 
namely Quinn taking advantage of a major league bonehead for a GM
in St Louis  This trade was an absolutely stupid trade for St Louis
and it was not the only stupid trade that this guy made  We can give
Quinn credit for being an opportunist here

stuff about other trades deleted

Plus his team has improved a much greater amount than Detroit since
he took over with them

How do you figure  Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year
They both won their division they had close to the same number of points
they both went down  in the first round of the playoffs before finally
escaping in  games and they both got knocked out in the second round by
teams they should have been able to beat with less talent  Specifically
if I remember correctly third place teams  How does this make Vancouver
more improved  Further if I'm not mistaken the Wings had more points than
Vancouver at the end of this season albeit not many

The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by

I don't notice refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around and
yes I have to agree that Stewart called the two worst games I've seen

SHI'm a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best I can
  here in the hockey hinterlands Oklahoma  I'm hoping I can get a
  reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas

SHI've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of or possibly
  THE hockey state in the US  So why is the team moving to a city in
  Texas  Is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or
  were the Stars really not making a profit  Or was the city or whoever
  owned the arena doing some price gouging

SHAs much as I'd like to see the NHL only a  hour drive from me I
  can't help but feel for the people in Minnesota unless they truly
  didn't support the team

SHOpinions please

I used to work for the Stars  Minnesota supported the team to an
extent  When I was there we had quite afew sellouts This was the
season after the cup run and during the finals  Norm's main bitch was
that there wasn't enough luxury suites  And the ones he had were not
always full  He wanted more boxes and wanted them full  He was just
asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games
at High Schools for  or college for about  that would probably be
better

Here is something crossposted from the AHL mailing list			

In a discussion between me and Chris Lerch the subject of Springfield's 
st round upset of the Providence Bruins
came up Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL 
hierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians He noted that the offices
for the league are in Spring and many exIndians are working for the AHL
Furthermore he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup 
finals between Roch and Spring that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office
and that

there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and
staff attending all games with the Springfield brass including sitting
in their box for the game in Springfield and according to the Rochester
media openly cheering for Springfield

Certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this
is true I don't know if this is anything more than whining on the
part of the Amerks they have pulled this sort of crap against the
Wings before but if true this is somthing that seriously raises
questions about President Jack Butterfield's leadership

	This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio
for ESPN hockey

	The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the PittNJ game 
even though the outcome was certain because of fear of the WashNy game 
going to overtime  When the Caps scored with  left to tie the game Al said
he heard many people say fK   
	ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOT
broadcast the OT of the hockey game  Next year ESPN will be introduced so 
baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey

	GET OFF ESPN'S BACK AND STOP POSTING ARTICLES ON THIS SUBJECT
There have been to many fn complainers about this game that it's making me
sick

hopp schwiiz
           daniel

The top  teams of this tournament will play in the Olympics next year
The last team of this tournament top two of pool B Great Britain and 
Poland and the winner of pool C Latvia will play for the last Olympic 
spot next fall
  However if next year's hosts Norway were to finish th which would be 
no surprise then it's the th team of pool A that will have to play in 
the qualification tournament

   Why would Pollin want to move the Caps because I think he
owns the Cap Centre  I know they don't sell out all of their 
games but they draw a lot more than the Bullets  If you
had the situation that Abe had would you move if you were
guaranteed that anyone who went to the games would have to 
park at the stadium because there has been nothing within
a half mile until the recent construction in
the area
   Can they win a game in OT again

   Which doesn't mean much since the statistics are mostly based on
the game playoff format But yes it looks dark for the B's What a
disappointment

The Fat Lady is about to hit the first noteOkayhow about  deficits
The B's chances for a comeback are now less That's based on game
playoff format

   Who do you think gets the start in game three I hope it is going
to be Blue If the team can rally around him maybe Moog can too
 
He got the start but the headlines on all Boston local TV sportscats
said it all  Sutter Blue It And he did

Harry Sinden's appearance outside of B's dressing room after Game 
was a pathetic site He said something really retarded to cover Sutter's
behindThis game is not about winning or losing Harrycheck the
schedule Your team is in the playoffs and about to go on a long summer
vacation on Sunday morning

Harry and his buttkisser Milbury will never admit that they screwed up
in a major way when they brought in one of the dumbest people in the
businessBrian Sutter Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in StLouis
speaks for itself The Blues really have a chance to advance to the
second round this year

Obviously you really don't know

They have spoken out cf Sec'y of State Christopher's recent trip to the ME

  Note the clause more forcibly above     My point is that they have
  made a few proforma perfunctory remarks and sent in a few C's and
  so forth but it's clearly not something they're losing much sleep over
  They're just going through the motions while Moslems are being ethnically

  out far more loudly than the Moslem nations in the UN and other world

Hmmsome might say Kuwaitis are nonwhite Ooops I forgot Kuwaitis are
oil rich loaded with petrodollars etc so they don't count

  Precisely   Humanitarian concerns were not the primary justification

 Dear Mr Beyer
 
 It is never wise to confuse freedom of speech with freedom
 of racism and violent deragatory
 
 It is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial 
 distinction

	In fact if a speach was not offensive to some its
protection under Freedom of speach laws would be useless It is
speach that some find questionable that must be protected be
it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist It is only
through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can
enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant That is the
idea behind freedom of expression
	What you find offensive might be perceived as truth by
some and what they might find offensive might be your belief
It is only through free exchange of ideas and insults as the
case seems to be with this channel that one can change
another's erring waysThat is why Jefferson said that here 
we are not afraid to tolerate error so long as reason is left to 
combat it

Gaza and the idea of separation

The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is
presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when
the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left We
were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War  Because of the
Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq Yossi Sarid 
currently Minister of the Environment  made his infamous
statement You look for me  ie I'am not making any more
efforts to speak with you From Yossi Sarid's point of view
Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew
or the danger of hunger it brought with it but whether or not the
Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party Similarly
MERETZ MK Deddi Tzuker recently faced with criticism from
residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his
government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and
peace responded by asking those present at the discussion whether
they would rather have a Likud government From the Leftists'
perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR
government regardless of what it does

These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the
future of the Occupied Territories will look and they want to
dictate to the Palestinians how to get there An essential step
towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's
government and from their point of view the expulsions were a
marginal byproduct of this government of peace which need not
disturb the routine course of events Likewise the Rabinic
policies in Gaza  the blowing up of houses with antitank rockets
and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in
the suppression of demonstrations  need not disturb it

But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces
itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has
lost his way when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian
workers or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel
Aviv Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing
to propose except separation Let's cut ourselves off from the
Palestinians let's build a fence so high that they won't be able
to harm us  this is the cry of the Israeli Left Let us erect a
fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation

Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz  The
liberal Left which does not differentiate between physical
separation and 'the future of the territories' must come to
understand that the regime of magnetic cards exclusion of Arab
workers closure and curfew are instruments of enforcement
designed for the suppression of a population in revolt and that
their ideological support for separation only provides
'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the status
quo

Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the
ruling community but it is only the ruled population which bears
its burden 

Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal
humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether
this position is also moral It is very easy to shake off
responsibility for this concentration of human suffering and to
thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation It is very
easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in
Jerusalem when this fence has a gate  the keys to which are at
the disposal of one hand  which opens to allow the Jews to pursue
all their interests but is barred to the Arabs

Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights
violations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights
violations

Let's make things clear My opposition to HR violations in Arab
States is total and without qualification No Arab State is and can
claim to be democratic No Arab state claims to be democratic

I am born in Palestine now Israel I have family there The lack of
peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life
I am concerned by Palestine Israel because I want peace to come to
it Peace AND justice 

If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states he should present
his claims and ask for support Jews who left Arab states are fully 
entitled to make claims and should do so if they consider their case has
a merit It is their basic right to return to these countries if they
wish If not they should not complain and compare themselves to the
Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since
Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations
quasi totally If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries they have a
legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support 

Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify legitimate nor
are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts
Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept which can only be
implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians 

Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical The first
party has a state and the other has none The first is an occupier and
the second the occupied For any meaningful relationship to emerge some
symmetry must be established As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise
the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people
and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own
past towards the Palestinians the Naqba of  etc and refuse to
acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal
of most Palestinian Arabs there will be no base for a real trust

When I read the first time the list of the  Arab villages
destroyed by the State of Israel in and after  I got a shock 
I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the
meaning of such massive destruction and destitution

The desertification of the arid Negev

Ground XII   The Dimona Nuclear Plant XIII  The Negev as a
Military Base XIV  The Negev in the Year 

Just after the creation of the State of Israel the phrase the
Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom was trumpeted
throughout the Western world After the Six Day War in  David
BenGurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle It's by our
pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land
into a fertile land created builtup areas towns and villages in
abandoned desert areas

Contrary to BenGurion's assertion it must be affirmed that
during the  years of the British mandate over Palestine and for
centuries previous a productive human presence was to be found in
all parts of the Negev desert  in the very arid hills and valleys
of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north These
were the Bedouin Arabs

The real desertification of the Negev mainly in the southern
part occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's
cultivated lands and pastures Nowadays the majority of the
 squarekilometer Negev which represents  percent of the
State of Israel pre borders has been desertified beyond
recognition The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev
are the Israeli army the Nature Reserves Authority whose chief
role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture
lands and vast industrial zones including nuclear reactors and
dumping grounds for chemical nuclear and other wastes Israeli
Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area
cultivated by the Bedouin before  and there is no Jewish
pastoral activity

I Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin
before and after 
 In 
according to British mandatory statistics the Beersheba
subdistrict which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev or
Southern district had  inhabitants almost all Bedouin
Arabs who held  camels  cows and oxen  sheep
and  goats

The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in
the north where precipitation ranged between  and  mm per
year In  they cultivated about  hectares of the
Beersheba district  ie  percent of its total area and more
than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers
after  years of making the desert bloom

The Bedouin had a very low crop yield   to  kilograms of
barley per hectare during rainy years  and their farming
techniques were primitive but production was based solely on
animal and human labor It must also be underscored that animal
production although low was based entirely on pasturing
Production increased considerably during the rainy years and
diminished significantly during drought years All Bedouin pasture
animals  goats camels and sheep  had the ability to gain weight
quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many
waterless days during the hot summers These animals were the
result of a centuriesold process of natural selection in harsh
local conditions

After the creation of the State of Israel  percent of the Negev
Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan The
 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of
 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 
mm  a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out
of three The rare water wells in the south and central Negev
spring of life in the desert were cemented to prevent Bedouin
shepherds from roaming

A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev
But after  when the Sinai was returned to Egypt these
Bedouin were also eliminated At the same time strong pressure
was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields
in order that the land could be transferred to the army

No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held
today by Negev Bedouin It is a known fact that a large part of
the  hectares they cultivated in the s has been seized
by the Israeli authorities Indeed most of the Bedouin are now
confined to seven development towns or sowetos established
for them

Diaspora 'a cancer'
 by Julian Kossoff and Lindsay Schusman in
Jewish Chronicle London  Dec 

Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator AB Yehoshua
launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth
Council meeting in North London last week

The diaspora he claimed was the cancer connected to the main
tissue of the Jewish people He was scathing about its failure to
act before the Holocaust

He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had
ignored the warning signs in the s and had fiercely opposed
Zionism Consequently he considered the Holocaust the failure
of Judaism

His talk entitled Diaspora A Neurotic Solution covered 
years of Jewish history

Mr Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were he
said not staying in Israel but running away and all Jews
outside Israel who were using other people's countries like
hotels

The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was
immoral because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived
elsewhere

Worse it threatened Israel itself creating a distraction for her
citizens who were leaving by the thousands

Mr Yehoshua who described himself as a soldier for aliyah
ended by calling for the creation of a new total Jew living in
Israel

Earlier speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the
difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature
Mr Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the
country's political situation

He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital
source of inspiration  Today Israeli writers avoided writing
directly about the ArabIsraeli conflict No major work had been
produced about the intifada

Instead writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity
emigration from Israel and personal and family issues

Mr Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the
Israeli political situation He could no longer step into an
Israeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real flesh and blood
character

He claimed that after  years of statehood the problem of
Israeli identity had not been solved He said Jews remained too
preoccupied with the borders of identity between Jew and nonJew
and were not concerned with the nature of that identity

Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life
unlike in the diaspora where Jews had no responsibility for the
country they lived in he said

He warned that modern Hebrew a unifying force for the Jewish
people would have to struggle for its future especially in
literary circles It faced fierce competition from the English
language

Poem by GermanJewish poet Erich Fried Holocaust survivor

Ein Jude an die zionistischen Kaempfer  

    von Erich Fried

Was wollt ihr eigentlich   Wollt ihr wirklich die uebertreffen
die euch niedergetreten haben vor einem Menschenalter in euer
eigenes Blut und in euren eigenen Kot 

	 

Wollt ihr die alten Foltern jetzt an andere weitergeben mit allen
blutigen dreckigen Einzelheiten mit allem brutalen Genuss die
Folterknechte wie unsere Vaeter sie damals erlitten haben 

       

Wollt jetzt wirklich ihr die neue Gestapo sein die neue Wehrmacht
die neue SA and SS und aus den Palaestinensern die neuen Juden
machen 

      

Aber dann will auch ich weil ich damals vor fuenfzig Jahren selbst
als ein Judenkind gepeinigt wurde von euren Peinigern ein neuer
Jude sein mit diesen neuen Juden zu denen ihr die Palaestinenser
macht

       

Und ich will sie zurueckfuehren helfen als freie Menschen in ihr
eigenes Land Palaestina aus dem ihr sie vertrieben habt oder in
dem ihr sie quaelt ihr Hakenkreuzlehrlinge ihr Narren und
Wechselbaelge der Weltgeschichte denen der Davidstern auf euren
Fahnen sich immer schneller verwandelt in das verfluchte Zeichen
mit den vier Fuessen das ihr nun nicht sehen wollt aber dessen Weg
ihr heut geht

through private contributions on Federal land  Your hatemongering
article is devoid of current and historical fact intellectual content
and social value  Down the toilet it goes


And we all know what an unbiased source the NYT is when it comes to things
concerning Israel

Neither the Times nor the trained seals who have responded thus far seem to
recognize the statement that these private funds were all tax exmpt  In
otherwords American taxpayers put up at least  of the money  And
finalyy how does Federal land mitigate the offensiveness of this alien
monument dedicated to perpetuating pitty and the continual flow of tax money
to a foreign entity

That Federal land and tax money could have been used to commerate
Americans or better yet to house homeless Americans

ANAS There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report
ANAS on the situation in the OT  But as most people used to see on TV the
ANAS Israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the OT  The Israelis 
ANAS used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters  
ANAS So this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine
ANAS They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in 
ANAS Palestine

Bring me one case where Israeli Soldiers deliberately killed a neutral 
reporter  This is another one of your wet dreams

Unlike many countries Israel does allow reporters in and out of the OT 
That is what the problem is If Israel were a country like China then 
nothing would transpire from what is happening in the OT But there
seems to be a proliferation of journalists in Israel always trying to show
how evil the Israeli monster is Arab countries don't allow journalists 
anywhere we have yet to hear about the massacres of Kurds the destruction
and annihilation of Hama the killings of moslem fundamentalists in mosques
in Egypt and Algeria etc Why is it we only get state reports How accurate
are they
Anas go give a lesson of freedom of speech to your Arab bretheren before
telling us what to do

This is nonsense I lived in the Negev for many years and I can say
for sure that no Beduins were moved or harmed in any way On the
contrary their standard of living has climbed sharply many of them
now live in rather nice permanent houses and own cars There are
quite a few Beduin students in the BenGurion university There are
good friendly relations between them and the rest of the population

All the Beduins I met would be rather surprised to read Mr Davidson's
poster I have to say

          I saw a naked girl with her hair down They were       
          dragging her She kept falling because they were       
          pushing her and kicking her She fell down it was     
          muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from 
          their balconies told us they seized her by the hair   
          and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the      
          mortgage bank that's a good block and a half or two

DEPOSITION OF TATYANA MIKHAILOVNA ARUTUNIAN NEZHINTSEVA

   Born 
   Train Conductor
   Azerbaijani Railroad

   Resident at Building  Apartment 
   Microdistrict No 
   Sumgait Azerbaijan

I hadn't lived very long in Sumgait only eight years I moved there from
Novosibirsk My son entered the Baku Nautical School and so I transferred
to Azerbaijan Later I met someone and married him and now my name is
Arutunian my husband's name   

That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly but there were hints 
and gibes so to speak at the Armenian people and they were mocking the 
Russians too I was constantly aware of it at work and not just this past 
year I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because 
I I'll just say it couldn't steal couldn't deceive and couldn't be 
involved in bribetaking And when I asked for decent working conditions they 
told me Leave don't keep the others from working you aren't cut out for 
this kind of work And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at 
the Armenians like The Turks had it right they killed them allthe way
they've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live and Things 
will be just fine if we get rid of them all No problem the Turks will 
help they say if we ask them they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an 
hour Well that's the way it all was but I never thought of course that it 
would spill over into a bloody tragedy because you just couldn't imagine it 
Here we've been living under the Soviet government for  years and no one 
even considered such an idea possible

But I had been forming my own opinions and in the presence of authoritative 
people I would often ask Where is this all leading do people really not see
what kind of situation is emerging here The Russians are fleeing Sumgait 
there are very few of them left Why is no one dealing with this what's going
on And when it all happened on the th and th it became clear that 
everything had been arranged by someone because what else are you to make of 
it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the
demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag I wouldn't be saying this now if I 
hadn't received personal confirmation from him later Because when we were 
under guard in the SK club on the st he came to the club that Muslimzade 
The women told me There he is there he is that's Muslimzade I didn't 
believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag I thought that 
they were just false rumors I went over to him and said Are you the First 
Secretary of our City Party Committee He answers me Yes And I ask him 
Tell me did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani 
flag and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs I don't know 
exactly what they said but there was mention of Armenian blood And he tells
me Yes I was there but I tried to dissuade them from it Then I asked him
another question And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering 
us And he said I   We didn't know what to do we didn't know we didn't 
anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait

Comrade Mamedov the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the 
Azerbaijani SSR answered the same question for me No we actually didn't 
anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait At that time we were trying to contain 
the crowd of  in Baku that was preparing for a massacre Those are his 
exact words the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the
Armenian SSR

And now about the events themselves Of course it's painful to discuss them 
because it may seem that it's not true to someone else Various rumors 
concerning what happened are making the rounds some are true others aren't 
But unfortunately there are more true ones than false because it was so 
horrible in our age here in the space age the age of science the age of
progress I don't know if someone had told me this story if I were living in
or around Moscow I wouldn't have believed it Why not Because it was really 
a genocide it was a massacre That's genuinely what it was

For example on that day the thI didn't know about the th because my 
husband and I were both sick both of us had the flu and we were in bedon 
the th our neighbor comes to our place and says You're in bed You don't 
know anything about it There was a demonstration in town and after it they 
were overturning Armenian cars and burning them They were looking into cars 
and asking 'Are you an Armenian' If they answered in Armenian then they 
turned the car over and burned it This isn't made up the wife of the Senior
Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us He was 
returning home from his dacha with his wife Raisa Sevastyanova she's my 
neighbor She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the 
middle of it I don't know what to call it the cavalcade of automobiles they 
were stopping He answered in Azerbaijani they let them go but they made him
honk the horn they were kicking up a fracas We didn't even believe it and 
I said Certainly that didn't happen how can that be And she said 
Muslimzade was leading the crowd and the Sputnik store was completely
smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians And when he saw 
that they had started breaking the glass in that store he said Don't break 
the shop windows don't destroy state property but do whatever else you want
 I didn't hear this with my own two ears but it is a fact that the store was
torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians 
although he's an Azerbaijani

While we were talking all of a sudden right across from us    Sevastyanova
is the first to look out the window and say Look there's a crowd out 
there And sure enough when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had 
already started wrecking the neighboring building There was an Armenian 
family there a woman and two girls They lived across from us I'm sorry I 
don't know the building number or the people's names since we were in my 
husband's apartment in Microdistrict  and I lived in Microdistrict No  
There was awful looting going on there at the time the most hideous things 
were going on there then One building there ours was attacked twice once 
wasn't enough for them They returned to the places where they hadn't finished
the Armenians off If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians they 
beat the Azerbaijanis too They also beat Russians if it was Russians doing 
the hiding Because there were Russians among them they said so on 
television there were people of various nationalities But they didn't tell 
us why there were people of different nationalities Because they wouldn't 
have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the 
Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes

At the time I saw this from the window I was there Sevastyanova was there 
and so was my husband We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly 
off a balcony All kinds of things even a sofa Then when it was all down 
there they burned it up Then we saw the crowd and they were all oohing At 
first I couldn't figure out what was happening And later I told my husband 
Lendrush l think they're beating someone out there And he answered I 
don't know could be Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment and I saw 
it and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too My husband had turned the other way 
he didn't see it I saw a naked girl with her hair down They were dragging 
her She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her She fell 
down it was muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from their 
balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of 
blocks as far as the mortgage bank that's a good block and a half or two 
from here I know this for sure because I saw it myself

Then the crowd rushed toward our building We were standing there and you can
of course imagine what we were feeling Were they going to kill us or not And
I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented
that woman because I had just seen that

I asked my husband I gave him an axe and said You kill me first and then 
let them do what they want with the corpse But our neighbors it's true 
defended us they said There aren't any Armenians in our entryway go away 
only Muslims live here Disaster missed us that time

But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about  people approximately 
came back to our place My husband was already asleep He can sleep when he's 
upset about something but I can't I was standing running from balcony to 
balcony Our power was out I don't remember for how long but it was as 
though it had been deliberately turned off There were no lights whatsoever 
and I was glad of course I thought it was better that way But then I look 
and the crowd is at our balcony This was at  in the morning The first 
time they were at our building it was  and now it was  in the 
morning But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor the 
Azerbaijani was awake and watching out there were human beings among them 
too So she goes out with a pail of garbage as though she needed to be taking
garbage out at two o'clock in the morning She used it as a pretext and went 
toward those young people They really were youngsters From my balcony you 
could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys They spoke 
Azerbaijani And when they came up to her she said What do you want And 
they answered We want the Armenian family that lives here pointing toward 
the second floor with their hands She says I already told you we don't 
have any Armenians here now leave do you hear this is an old Muslim woman 
talking to you and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around
her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away And so they 
seemed to listen to her They were all very young they started apologizing 
and left That was the second time death was at our door

I forgot to mention about one other apartment a man named Rubik lives there 
I don't know him really I knew his daughter I mean I saw her around but we 
really didn't know them But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth 
floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight 
months to earn money Can you imagine what that means He risked his life to 
earn X amount of money in order to better his family He bought new furniture 
and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage but alas
everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels They threw everything 
out the windows and the rest we saw from our balcony how the neighbors on 
the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that 
hadn't already been smashed or taken What is one to think of that It means 
that the parents in those families were in on it too Unfortunately I came to 
be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been 
foreseen in advance both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of 
apartments Something on the order of We'll move the Armenians out and take 
over their apartments

I have worked honestly my whole life you can check everything about me I 
came as a patriot from China waited for nights on end in front of the 
Consulate General of the USSR I came to my homeland as a patriot because I 
knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things But when I saw in 
Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them that Party membership was 
bought that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain that there were 
no ideals no ideas God save me everything was being bought and sold I saw 
all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did

I can't talk any more about it    the image of that beating    When I
went out of my own apartmentthey picked us up under Soviet Army guard they 
had arrived from all over to suppress that gangnot only Armenians but some 
Russian families and their children too came out of their apartments and
joined us because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with 
the situation the way it was And what's interesting is that when we left on 
the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people for sure 
people would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for 
the Armenians would somehow understand the injustice of what was done But 
having analyzed and weighed the whole thing once I calmed down having 
thought it all through I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people 
If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed 
and that basically depended on that Muslimzadehe said that he had wanted to 
calm them downthen is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom
he could whisper at the last minute Go and announce it on television 
Citizens of Sumgait Take what you can into your hands let's protect our 
neighbors from this massacre Those crowds weren't such that there was no 
controlling them Basically they were unarmed They didn't have firearms 
mostly they had knives they had all kinds of metal parts like armature 
shafts sharpened at the ends special rocks different to a degree that we 
noticed them there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils they were 
brought from somewhere as though it were all specially planned So as I was 
saying I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend 
us why wasn't it arranged It means that the government didn't want to do 
it When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik 
what there was no way of informing Baku No there was no way it turns out
The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict I won't mention the things 
I didn't see myself I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed They 
were in Microdistrict  beginning at  o'clock in the evening when I saw them
from the other building and they were somewhere else until midnight or one 
o'clock in the morning because at  they came back to our building They
hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict  
When they returned to our building I told my husband Lendrush now the 
police are probably going to come my God now the authorities are probably 
going to find out and come to our aid Well alas no there were to be no 
authorities not a single policeman not a single fireman not a single 
ambulance came while they were raging as it turns out as we later found out
beginning on the Might of the th There were dead people ruined apartments
and burned autos one car near the bus station it was burned and overturned 
it was probably there about four days everyone saw it and what went on in 
Block  Those who live there know they saw from their balconies how they 
attacked the soldiers in the buses how they beat those poor unarmed
soldiers and how on that square I can't remember the name of it where there
is that fork coming from the bus station that intersection now I'm upset and
I can't think of the name    there's a tall building there a story and 
from the balconies there people saw that butchery when the poor soldiers 
wearing only helmets with shields and those unfortunate clubs moved against 
that mob And when they fell those to yearold boys ran up and using 
stones big heavy stones beat them to death on their heads Who could have 
guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under 
the Soviet government The upshot is that this republic has not been under 
Soviet control for a long time but no one wanted to pay any attention or get 
involved

If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the
truth I've been struggling for truth for five years there already the five 
years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad Some people there considered 
me a demagogue others who knows what some think I'm an adventure seeker and
some a prankster But I wanted everything to be right I would become
outraged how can this be why is it people treat one another this way on a 
Soviet railroad as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property
or the property of some magnate or some mafia If I want to I'll get you 
out of here If I want to I'll get rid of you If I want to I'll do 
something else And there's a black market price for everything in the most 
brazen way a coach to Moscow costs so much a coach on a local train costs so
much Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool he had 
the nerve to tell me maybe you won't even believe this but this I'm afraid
I heard with my own ears Tatyana just how long can you fight for something
that you know will never have any effect You're alone against everyone so 
instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor and everything 
will go fine for you I started to cry turned and left What else could I 
do where else could I go to complain I realized that everything was useless
And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see
it I filed a written complaint and they ground it into dust they destroyed 
it I still have a copy but what's the use When the General Procuracy got 
involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair in addition to 
the information about what I saw what I was a witness to I gave testimony 
about the mafia at the railroad They accepted my petition but I don't know 
if they're going to pursue it or not Because you'll excuse me I no longer 
believe in the things I aspired to the things I believed in before It's all 
dead They just spit on my soul stomped on everything physically and most 
important spiritually because you can lose belongings that's nonsense that
all comes with time but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in 
youyour beliefsare destroyed it can be very difficult to restore them

I want to tell of one incident I just don't know at the time I was in such a
state that I didn't even take minor things into account Here is an example
Of course it's not a minor one My neighbor Raisa Sevastyanova she has a
son Valery who is in the th grade in a school in Microdistrict  A boy
Vitaly Danielian I don't know his last name goes to school with him or
rather went to school with him I was just sitting in an apartment trying to
make a phone call to Moscow    Oh yes and there's one important detail
When the massacre began for two to three hours the phones weren't working in 
Armenian apartments and later in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments
But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off you could not call 
anywhere Why Again it means it was all planned How come service is cut off
for no reason And the lights went off And those brats were raging as they
liked They weren't afraid they ran about freely they that no one would slap 
their hands and no one would dare to stop them  They knew it

Now I'm going to tell about the incident So this little Vitaly Vitalik an
Armenian boy went to school with Valery they were in the same class 
According to what Valery and his neighbor pal saidat the time I was in the
same apartment as they were I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put
througha mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived So Valery ran to
his mother and said Mamma please let me go to Vitalik's what if they kill
him Maybe he's still alive maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow
   He's a nice guy we all like him he's a good person he's smart His 
mother wouldn't let him go In tears she says Valery you can't go because 
I am afraid He says Mamma we can get around the crowd We'll just watch 
just have a look They made it through I don't know I think Vitalik's
parents lived in Microdistrict No  and when they got there they made a 
superficial deduction Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken 
everywhere that you could see from the street which were the Armenian 
apartments in the building they went here and there and looked and saw that 
the windows were intact and so they calmed down But even though the windows 
in that apartment were not broken everything inside was totally smashed and 
Vitalik lay there with a broken skull and his mother and father had already 
been murdered Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead So two weeks 
ago I don't know he was in critical condition no maybe it was longer we 
left Sumgait on March  spent some time in Moscow and then we came to 
Yerevan So it's been about a month already it's so hard to keep all this 
straight So Valery the next day when he found out that Vitalik's family has
been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku Valery and
his classmates got together and went to visit him But they wouldn't admit 
them telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in 
a coma They cried and left having also found out that the girl I saw being 
kicked and dragged was in that hospital too As it turns out she was brought 
there in serious condition but at least she was alive at the time   

When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another 
throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them because you had wondered if 
these friends were alive or not if those friends were alive or not     And
when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived When
you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end

If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book A book of 
things it is even difficult to believe And those two girls who were raped 
were entirely black and blue the ones at the SK they know I'm not lying 
that girlfriend came up to one of them and said What happened and she 
bared her breasts and they were completely covered in cigarette burns    
those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts After something like that 
I don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it

Now    When we stayed at the military unit for a while they provided
well basic conditions for us there The military unit is located in Nasosny
some six miles from Sumgait And living there we met with a larger group
of people There were about  people at the unit You know there was a
point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw
so much heartbreak around you And when you hear the false rumors   

Yes by the way false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians
around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground
with bulldozers I didn't know whether to believe it or not And people who 
don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge But when 
I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak and in Spitak all those villages are 
not only intact but at that time had even been protected just in case they 
were guarded they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak Not a 
single person there died and no one is planning to harm them Around Yerevan 
all the villages are safe and unharmed and the Armenians didn't attack 
anyone But actually after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there
could have been a feeling of vengefulness but no one acted on it And I don't
know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are 
guilty that it is they who organized it Rumors like that are being spread in
Azerbaijan And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it they not
only perceive it with their minds but with their hearts too To them it 
seems that the older person is telling the truth For example one says Did 
you know that out of  people killed by the way originally they said  
people but later they found a nd  were Azerbaijani and one was an 
Armenian

Of course I'm upset but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and
not become upset Sometimes l forget things but I know I want to return to
the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee
When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I 
couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner I already
mentioned this and if I repeat anything please excuse me I asked him Why 
did you do that and why are you here now why did you come here To laugh at 
these women who are strewn about on the floor The overcrowding there was 
tremendous it was completely unsanitary and several of the children were
already sick It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us They 
cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food but 
the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at 
it everywhere that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere Plus they 
were never given any direct orders they didn't know what they were authorized
to do and not to do And it was only on March  at five o'clock in the evening
that Krayev himself the Lieutenant General the City Commandant of Sumgait 
was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored 
personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do as his heart 
advised him and relocate people to the military unit

But that's not what I want to talk about now Muslimzade characteristically 
tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party
Committee which is across the square from the club He took me by the
hand and said Citizen don't worry we'll go and have a talk in my office
I told him No after everything you've done I don't believe one iota of 
what you say If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear and the 
traces of me will disappear too Because you can't stand it when     Oh 
yes and there was another interesting detail from that meeting It was even 
very funny although at the time I wasn't up to laughing He was in a nice 
expensive hat and so as to put him to shame so to speak I said Oh why 
did you come here all duded up like a London dandy you smell of good perfume
you're in your starched shirt and you have your expensive hat on You came
to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor who are
already getting sick whose relatives have died Did you come to laugh at
them And the one who was accompanying him an Azerbaijani I don't know who 
he was or what his title was he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head 
and hid it Then I said My God We're not marauders We're not you We 
didn't come to you with the intention of stealing Well kill me kill me 
Muslimzade says to me But I'm not guilty    kill me kill me but I'm not
guilty And I say OK fine you're not guilty have it your way But give 
us an answer we're asking you Where were you when they were torturing and 
raping those poor women when they were killing the children burning things 
carrying on outrageously and wrecking all those apartments Where were you 
then You know we didn't expect it we did not know what to do we didn't 
anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait I started 
laughing and said It's truly funny He says What could I do We didn't 
know what to do And I say I'm sorry but it'll be ridiculous if I tell 
you The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in 
front with a banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross 
over his dead body That's what you should have done That's the way it was 
during the war Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself
either he died or he led people into battle And what did you do You ran 
away you left you hid you marched with a flag because you were afraid 
excuse my language you feared for your own damned hide And when we ask you 
you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done 
That's right I told him the City party committee got confused all the 
party committees got confused the police got confused Baku got confused 
they all lay in a faint for two weeks and the gang ran the show with 
impunity And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two 
days there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure they would 
have finished their bloody affair because they brazenly went up to some 
Russians too the ones who tried to say something to them and they told 
them 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you too

And by the way there was a colonel who took us to the military unit He was
the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later
arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to
the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit We 
asked him What How What will come of us He openly said You know for 
us the main thing now is to catch that gang We'll finish that quickly You'll
stay at the military unit for the time being and we'll decide later The 
General Procuracy of the USSR arrived it consists of investigators from all 
cities There were some from Stavropol from everywhere just everywhere because 
the affair was truly frightful About this by the way Comrade Katusev spoke
as everyone knows he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR When 
he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit 
by the way he told us the honest truth because he couldn't not say it 
because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen 
and he said There was Afghanistan and it was bad but Sumgaitit's
horrible And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely 
punished in accordance with our laws And that's a quote Then one mother 
throws herself at himher two sons had died before her very eyesand says
Who will return my sons Who is going to punish the culprits They tried 
to calm her down and he said In order for us to conduct a proper 
investigation in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility you 
must help us because we don't know maybe there was someone else in the gang 
who is now being concealed in homes and maybe the neighbors know maybe 
someone saw something Don't be afraid write about it in detail So that 
you're not afraid    Everyone knows that many of you are afraid having 
lived through such horrors they think that if they write the whole truth 
about let's say their neighbor or someone else that they will seek revenge 
later We're going to do it like this We're going to set up an urn and you 
can throw what you write in there We don't need to know who wrote it The 
names of the people who write won't be made public but we need all the
information Let each and every one not be afraid let each write what is 
necessary who they saw in that gang who made threats or shouted threatening 
gibes about the Armenians    You must describe all of these people and put 
the information into the urn

Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn And sure enough many people 
people who didn't even want to write   I know one woman who asked me she 
came up and said You as a Russian the same thing won't happen to you as 
will happen to me So please    I'll give you the information and you 
please write it down for me So she was afraid and there were a lot like
her    But later after Katusev made his speech she sat and wrote down
everything she knew And we threw it all into the urn Now we don't know if 
it will be of any use For a factual picture will emerge from all that 
information One person can lie but thousands can't lie thousands simply 
can't lie You have to agree with that a fact is a fact Why for example 
should someone say that black is white if it is really black

   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani
SSR Mamedov as I said was in Yerevan My husband and I were at the Council 
of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present the 
one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their 
previous dwellings to their old apartments We asked for a meeting with him 
and it was granted When we went to see him he tried to behave properly very 
politely delicately but    when the truth was told right to his face and 
when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade Where were
you personally when they were beating us Now you're trying to convince us to 
return why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where 
it was all leading he says You're telling the truth Let's not mince 
words You've told me right to my face and I'll tell you straight I'll tell 
you the pure truth I was gotten out of bed in the evening the whole 
government was up including me and we were restraining a crowd of about 
 in Baku But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait with its 
fine international record such a thing could happen We expected it in Baku
I say So that means you expected it all the same Why were you expecting 
it And he says You know it just happened that way We were expecting it 
in Baku we were trying to restrain it but in Sumgait     I say Fine 
you didn't know for the first three or four hours but then you should have 
known Why did no one help us And he says Well OK we didn't know what to
do and things like that Basically it was the same story I got from 
Muslimzade Later when he said You go on back the situation in Sumgait is 
favorable now everything is fine the Armenians are friendly with the 
Azerbaijanis     To this l answered You know what    I'm speaking 
with you as a member of a neutral nation    I have never argued with 
Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness    You tell me 
please Comrade Mamedov  I asked him What would you say about this
honestly if you were being completely frank with us Then he said Yes I 
admit that I am honestly ashamed shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation we 
have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union but before 
the whole world Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign 
radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors too
And I say There's nothing to add to what really happened I don't think it's
possible to add anything more awful He says Yes I agree with you I 
understand your pain it is truly an unfortunate occurrence I repeat that he
said unfortunate occurrence And then he suddenly remembered himself what 
he was sayinghe had a pen in his hands he was fidgeting with it nervously
and said Oh excuse me a tragedy really     I take this to mean that 
he really thinks it's an unfortunate occurrence And of course he says 
I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait 
but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being 
tried And he even gave a detail which I don't know if it matters or not 
that  policemen were being tried Specifically in relation to that bloody 
affair

Yes by the way there is another good detail how I was set up at work in
Baku after the events I went to an undergarment plant there was an 
Azerbaijani working there and suddenly she tells me What they didn't
nail your husband They screwed up I was floored I hadn't imagined that
anyone in Baku too could say something like that Well after that I went up
to see    to my office I needed to find out about those days what was
going to happen with them how they were going to put down those days from 
February  to March     and the administrator told me I don't know 
Tatyana go to the head of the conductors' pool Be grateful if they don't 
put it down as unexcused absence I was really discouraged by this They all 
know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived and here 
they're telling me that I was skipping work as though I was off enjoying 
myself somewhere I went to the office of the chief of the pool his last name
is Rasulov and he's had that position for many years Incidentally he's a 
Party member and is a big man in town And suddenly when I went to him and 
said Comrade Rasulov this is the way it was     He looked at me askance
and said And why are youhe knows me by my previous last namewhy did
you get wrapped up in this mess I say What do you mean why did I get 
wrapped up in this mess My husband's an Armenian I tell him I have an 
Armenian last name And he screwed up his face made a kind of a grimace as 
though he had eaten something sour and said I didn't expect that you would
    What did he mean by that And how should he behave the chief of the
pool a man who supervises  workers Now it's true there was a 
reduction but for sure there are still  conductors working for him And 
if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that then what 
can you expect from a simple uneducated politically unsophisticated person
He's going to believe any and all rumors that the Armenians are like this 
the Armenians are like that and so on   

By the way that Mamedovnow I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked 
him Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return 
to Sumgait he answered Yes you know I would guarantee them    I don't
want to take on too much I would guarantee them firmly for  years But I 
won't guarantee them for longer than  years I say So you've got another
thing like that planned for  years from  now So they'll be quiet and then 
in another  years it'll happen again I couldn't contain myself any more
and I also told him And how did it get to that point certainly you knew
about it how they were treating the Russians for example in Baku and in 
Sumgait how they were hounded from their jobs Certainly you received
complaints I wrote some myself Why did no one respond to them Why did 
everyone ignore what was going on Didn't you prepare people for this by the 
way you treated them And he says You know you're finally starting to 
insult me He threw his pen on the desk Maybe now you'll say I'm a 
scoundrel too I say You know I'm not talking about you because I don't 
know But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction yes that 
comrade was involved in this that and that because I know for certain
Well anyway he assured us that here in Yerevan there were false rumors 
that  Sumgait Armenians were here and  were in Sumgait and had 
gotten back to work Everyone was working he said and life was very good 
We drove about the town ourselves Comrade Arutiunian First Secretary of 
the Communist Party of Armenia SSR came from the Council of Ministers of 
Armenian he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in
Sumgait When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said '
Well I walked down the street And I said Walking down the street in any 
city even if I were to go to New York I would never understand the situation
because I would be a guest I don't have any contact with people but if you 
spend  days among some bluecollar workers in such a way that they didn't 
know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers you'd 
hear something quite different I told him for example that I drew my 
conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments They took
us all in turns to pick things up since people had fled to the military unit
they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible How are the 
neighbors in the microdistrict how will they view us what do they think I 
thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general of a mass nature some
antinational something And when that bus took us to our building because it
was the same bus while we were going up to our apartment an armed soldier 
accompanied us What does that say It speaks of the fact that if everything 
there were fine why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with
us going from apartment to apartment And in fact especially with the young 
people you could sense the delight at our misfortune the grins and they 
were making comments too And that was in the presence of troops when police
detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and 
tanks were passing by And if people are taking such malicious delight when 
the situation is like that then what is it going to be like when they 
withdraw protection from the city altogether There will be more outrages of 
course perhaps not organized but in the alleys

The readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents
of those files
So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us
 Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous

ADL authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous including
the millions of Americans of Arab ancestry  Perhaps you can answer
the question as to why the ADL maintained files and spied on ADC members
in California and elsewhere  Friendly rivalry perhaps

Come on  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war 
against Israel  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations  That is
the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals
only a few years ago  


The ADC is an organization of ArabAMERICANS

Let me seeyou're saying that most if not all ArabAMERICANS should be
spied on  You're also saying that most if not all ArabAMERICANS
should be views as a national security threat to Israel and the US 
as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the WTC bombing in 
which no ArabAMERICANS were involved  By inference can we assume 
that you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses 
a threat to Israel and therefore should be spied on

Like it or not Edward Anwar has a very good valid point  Obviously
in presenting it he quite legitimately and deliberately takes a point
of view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended but
that is one of the best ways to demonstrate a slippery slope type of
argument which I believe was his aim

I very frankly believe that the ADL will be proved innocent in this
case  I doubt there's enough evidence to weigh against them even in a
civil court where preponderance of the evidence not evidence beyond
any reasonable doubt is the standard for winning such a case  That
however does not prevent me from seeing the merit in Anwar's point

Hamza maybe the missile didn't hit directly such that his body
Hamza gets desintegrated  of course destroying  houses to
Hamza kill someone is not a surgical operation or is it

 I said the fixation on Bosnia is due to it being in a European country
  rather than the third world
I recall before we did anything for Somalia apparent leftwingers saying
that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to
Somalia was because the Somalis are thirdworlders who Americans consider
unworthy of help  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to
the opposite place than that predicted by the theory
I am a staunch Republican BTW  The irony of arguing against military
intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me  I was opposed
to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons although clearly it was
not nearly as risky

Based on the same reasons  You mean you were opposed to US intervention in
Somalia because since Somalia is a European country instead of the third world
the desire to help Somalia is racist  I don't think this same reason applies
to Somalia at all

The whole point is that Somalia is a third world country and we were more
willing to send troops there than to Bosniaexactly the opposite of what
the fixation on European countries theory would predict  Similarly the
desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite
of what that theory predicts

For that matter this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to
help the Serbs  After all they're Christian and the Muslims are not  If
the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are
less like us why does everyone want to help the side that is less like us
Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think
Well one thing you have to remember is the press likes a good story   Good
for business don't you know  And BTW not everyone wants to help the
side that is less like us

I'm referring to people who want to help at all of course  You don't see
people sending out press releases help Bosnian Serbs with ethnic cleansing
The Muslim presence in the Balkans should be eliminated now  Well except
for some Serbs but I admit that the desire of Serbs in America to help the
Serbian side probably is because those are people more like them

	The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak
	

		On the ancient peak of Ararat
		The centuries have come like seconds
		And passed on
				Avetik Issahakian

by Yuri Danilov

Some years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them What
books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight And 
though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from  to  
depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer 
and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes ages and professions 
not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at
least one book of arithmetic problems

Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they 
were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for numbers though 
secretly afraid of them Others steered clear of such puzzle books because 
they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern 
mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't 
know how to solve mere arithmetic problems Professional mathematicians were 
no exception Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin a 
specialist in statistics wrote about arithmetic I willingly confess that 
any time a fifthgrader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem it was
a hard work for me and sometimes I failed completely Of course like most of 
my friends I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route
constructing equations or sets of equations But we were supposed to avoid 
using algebraic analysis at all costs    By the way it's a fact that is 
well known and oft repeated that as a rule neither high school graduates 
nor students at teaching colleges nor teachers beginning their careers
nor I must add scientific researchers can solve arithmetic problems It 
seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifthgrade 
teachers

Now I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the 
bookbag of anyone flying into space But a sense of justice induces me to 
recommend one particular problem book one that will satisfy the most 
fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a 
relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyagesay to
Venus and back

			One for the road

	They both took out the books they brought for the road Kingsley 
	glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with 
	a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers God 
	knows what this kind of stuff leads to thought Kingsley

	The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History 
	of Herodotus Good Lord next he'll be reading Thucydides thought

The book I'm talking about isn't very big but its  problems constitute  
elegant miniatures from seventhcentury Armenia Naive and wise at the same
time rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period these 
problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian 
architecture the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van in what is 
now Turkey They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant 
letters of the Armenian alphabet invented by Mesrop Mashtots or the songs of 
Komitas or the paintings of Saryan

An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a 
bibliographic rarity It was published under the title Problems and Solutions
of Vardapet  Anania of Shirak Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh 
Century translated and published by I A Orbeli Petrograd 

The abundance of close observations and wideranging information about the way 
of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and 
worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book For many years 
the book was known only to researchers in the humanitiesspecialists in 
Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just
anyone see it Even now after research by K P Patkanov the learned monk 
Father Kaloust JI Orbeli A Abramyan V K Chaloyan and others has 
brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles the 
general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable 
problem book

		Vardapet Anania of Shirak

	Once fell in love with the art of calculation I thought that no 
	philosophical notion can be constructed without number considering 
	it the mother of all wisdom
					Anania of Shirak

Among ancient Armenian thinkers Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because 
of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his 
work Some of his works have been preserved In addition to the Problems and
Solutions the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation
of scholars On Weights and Measures Cosmography and Calendrical Theory and
Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century AD the authorship of the last
work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia 
Movses of Khoren

In his autobiography Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself

	I Anania of Shirak having studied all the science of our
	Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately 
	in the expression of the psalmist every day I illuminated the 
	eyes of my mind Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation
	I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy 
	the mother of all sciences without number I could find in Armenia 
	neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the 
	sciences I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man 
	named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works He told me
	that in Forth Armenia  there lived a famous mathematician
	Christosatur I went this person and spent six months with him But 
        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but 
        only of certain fragmentary facts

	I then went to Constantinople where I met acquaintances who told me 
	Why did you go so far when much closer to us in Trebizon on the 
	coast of Pontus  lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik He is full 
	of wisdom is known to kings and knows Armenian literature I asked 
	them how they knew this They answered We saw ourselves that many 
	people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man 
	Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople
	Philagrus traveled with us bringing many young persons to become 
	pupils of Tyukhik When I heard this I expressed my gratitude to 
	God who had quenched the thirst of His slave

	I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St Eugene and explained why I 
	had come He received me graciously and said I praise Our Lord that 
	He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St 
	Gregory I am glad that all your country will learn from me I myself 
	lived in Armenia for many years as a youth Ignorance reigned there 
	Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with 
	me The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing I completely assimilated 
	the science of number and with such success that my fellow students
	at the king's court began to envy me

	I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not 
	been translated into our language For the vardapet had an innumerable 
	collection of books secret and explicit ecclesiastical and pagan 
	books on art history and medicine books of chronologies Why 
	enumerate them by title In a word there is no book that Tyukhik did 
	not have And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating
	that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into 
	Armenian he did not struggle as other translators did and the 
	translation read as if the work were written in that language 
	originally

	Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had 
	learned the Armenian language When I was young he said I lived 
	in Trebizon at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus and 
	for a long time up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I 
	served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and 
	literature During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks I was 
	wounded and escaped to Antioch I lost all my possessions Praying to 
	the Lord to heal my wounds I made a promise If You prolong my life 
	I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to 
	collecting treasures of knowledge And the Lord heard my prayers 
	After I recovered I went to Jerusalem and from there to Alexandria 
	and Rome Upon returning to Constantinople I met a famous philosopher 
	from Athens and studied with him for many years After that I returned 
	to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people

	After some years that philosopher died Not finding a replacement for 
	him the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to 
	assume the teacher's position Tyukhik citing the promise he made to 
	God not to move far from the city turned down the offer But because
	of his wide leaning people came streaming from all countries to study 
	with him

	And I the most insignificant of all Armenians having learned from 
	him this powerful science desired by kings brought it to our 
	country supported by no one obligated only to my own industry God's 
	help and the prayers of the Blessed Educator And no one thanked me 
	for my efforts

				Problems and Solutions

	A half and one sixth and one nineninth of all the books were printed
	on verge' one fifth and one twohundredeightyfifthon rag paper 
	one fortyfifth and one eighthundredfiftyfifthon vellum and

					Imitation of Anania of Shirak

A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli books have their own fate
The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing The
manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because according to 
Armenian historians in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded 
from invaders like weapons and cherished like one's own children Biding
their time the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran a renowned depository of 
ancient manuscripts now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts
And its hour finally arrived In  the learned monk Father Kaloust used two 
manuscripts to publish the problem book supplementing it with an introduction 
and commentary In  the book was translated into Russian edited 
annotated and typeset by Iosef Orbeli a prominent scholar and later a 
member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR

In the translator's words the problems of Anania are amusing full of life 
and simple Orbeli goes on to say The subjects of the problems are 
generally taken from everyday life The scene is predominantly his homeland 
Shirak and the surrounding countryside and the dramatis personae if they are 
named are the local princesthe Kamsarakans including Nersekh who was a 
contemporary of Anania Like other ancient authors Anania of Shirak used 
only aliquots  that is fractions with a numerator of  When it is
necessary to write fractions with numerators other than  one has to 
represent it as a sum of aliquots see the epigraph above

Like any true work of art the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the 
retelling You have to read the originals albeit in translation in their 
full glory So let's open Anania's problem booka gift from across the ages

Problems  and  relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in AD 


Problem 

My father told me the following story During the famous wars between the 
Armenians and the Persians prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary 
heroic deeds Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops 
The first time he struck down half of the Persian army The second time 
pursuing the Persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers The third 
time he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army The Persians who were 
still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to Nakhichevan And so from 
this remainder find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre

Problem 

During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians when Zaurak
Kamsarakan killed Suren one of the Armenian azats sent an envoy to the
Persian king to report the baleful news The envoy covered fifty miles in a 
day Fifteen days later when he learned of this Zaurak Kamsarakan sent 
riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back The riders covered eighty miles in 
a day And so find how many days it took them to catch the envoy

Problem  mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal In the Russian 
translation they are all called dishes But in the original Armenian 
according to Orbeli's note the dishes in the first and second instances are 
called mesur and in the third instance scutel Scutel is a common Armenian 
word but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before 
Anania's Problems and Solutions

Problem 

There was a tray in my house I melted it down and made other vessels from the 
metal From one third I made a mesur from one fourth another mesur from
one fifth two goblets from one sixth two scutels and from two hundred ten 
drams I made a bowl And now find the weight of the tray

Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in 
Anania's time  for instance problem 

Problem 

Once I was in Marmet the capital of the Kamsarakans Strolling along the bank 
of the river Akhuryan I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast 
We caught a half and a quarter of the school and all the fishes that slipped
out of the net ended up in a creel When I looked in the creel I found 
fortyfive fishes And now find how many fishes here were in all

The temptation is great to present all  problems But I'll restrain myself
and offer you just one more

Problem  provides some interesting information about the wild animals that 
inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no
mention of them even in zoological reference books The wild donkey according 
to the generally accepted view never roamed the Armenian lands Yet Anania of 
Shirak offers evidence to the contrary 

Problem 

The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan ter of Shirak and Asharunik 
was at the base of the mountain called Artin One night great herds of wild
donkey entered the preserve The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and 
running to the village of Talin told Nersekh about them When he arrived with
his brothers and azats and entered the preserve they began killing the wild 
beasts Half of the animals were caught in traps one fourth were killed by 
arrows The young which constituted one twelfth of all the animals were 
caught alive and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears And 
so find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre

Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy n of the small printingn is the 
solution to the epigraph in the previous section of the Russian translation 
of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions a thin book with yellowed pages
has probably noticed the variety of the fonts the elegance of the borders 
and the high quality of the design printing and binding Such great 
attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for 
a degree in bookmaking And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma 
attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it An 
advertisement at the end of the book reads This book was typeset in 
December  at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by 
me Iosef Orbeli the text was also proofread laid out and decorated with 
borders by me Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project 
to the end the final pages of the book were typeset by M Strolman

Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned 
orientalist Iosef Orbeli who later became the director of the Hermitage 
Museum in Leningrad He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith Orbeli had 
already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis 
Academiae founded in  and known all over the scientific world for its 
rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters In preparing to publish 
the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian 
churches Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve 
the unique signs and ligatures This complicated work was done by M G
Strolman Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the 
blockade of Leningrad in World War II

When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences times 
were hard The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania
was for Orbeli to learn typesetting he had always been attracted to the 
printer's craft In  Orbeli became the director of printing at the 
Academy of Sciences Even after he retired he remained a tireless champion
of Russian academic typography

interesting guy When I get home I'll try to find his problems

Good luck my young friend Anania is sure to entertain you Perhaps by then
there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions And 
we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by

 Vardapet or vartabed means teacher or learned man in Armenian The
    Armenian language suffers in English from a dual transliteration scheme
    Thus Mesrop is often rendered as Mesrob Komitas as Gomidas and so 
    on

 Fourth Armenia was one of fifteen provinces into which according to
    Armenian Geography in the Seventh Century AD socalled Great Armenia
    was divided

 Pontus or Pontus Euxinus was an old name for the Black Sea

 Azats were members one of several strata of freemen in ancient Armenia

 Ter was the title of the heads of sovereign royal families in ancient 
     Armenia

The latest Israeli proposal first proposed in February of  contains 
the following assumptions concerning the nature of any interim status 
refering to the WB and Gaza the Palestinians implemented by negotiations
It states that    
   Israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status
    is agreed upon
   Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the 
    Interim SelfGovernment Arrangements ISGA
   The ISGA will apply to the Palestinian inhabitants of the territories
    under Israeli military administration The arrangements will not have a 
    territorial application nor will they apply to the Israeli population 
    of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem
   Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel
   Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd
   Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects
    external internal and for the maintenance of public order
   The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrativefunctional nature
   The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and 
    coordination with Israel 
   Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the 
    areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education
    business tourism labor and social welfare local police
    local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious
    affairs

Several question do come to mind concerning the success we all hope for 
in the ongoing negotiation process These arrangements certainly seem to 
be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian interim selfcontrol 
Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible 
vulnerability can Israel reasonably put forward at later points in the 
negotiating process more relaxed proposals for thisinterim period 
How should proposals from either side be altered to temper their 
maximalist approaches as stated above How can Israeli worries and 
desire for some interim control be addressed while providing for a  
very real interim Palestinian selfgoverning entity

Tim

Later comment

There seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed The
first is that of Israel where there is little trust for Arab groups so
there is little support for Israel giving up tangible assets in 
exchange for pieces of paper expectations hopes etc The second
is that of the Arab worldPalestinians where there is the demand that
these tangible concessions be made by Israel without it receiving
anything tangible back  Given this the gap between the two stances
seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some tangible returns
for its expected concessions By tangible is meant something that
 provides Israel with comparable protection from the land it is to 
give up  in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine 
will be accountable and held actively not just diplomatically 
responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory by citizens 
or visitors

Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute
it lets go gives lands back to Arab states no more buffer zone gives
full autonomy to Palestinians ANY andor ALL of the Arab parties
could and would if not controlled somehow EASILY return to the 
traditional antiIsrael position The question then is HOW to really
ensure that that will not happen

 I think the Israeli press might be a tad bit biased in
 reporting the events I doubt the Propaganda machine of Goering
 reported accurately on what was happening in Germany It is
 interesting that you are basing the truth on Israeli propaganda
 
 Since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either Arab or 
 Palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn 
 Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another The only way 
 to determine that is to try and get beyond the writer's political
 agenda whether it is on or against our side
 
 Tim 

To Andi

I have to disagree with you about the value of Israeli news sources If you
want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news
directly from the source EVERY news source is inherently biased to some
extent and for various reasons both intentional and otherwise However 
the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the truth and to discern 
the bias 

Go read or listen to some Israeli media You will learn more news and more
opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so Then you can form your own
opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't 
change

 Problem 
 
 My father told me the following story During the famous wars between the 
 Armenians and the Persians prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary 
 heroic deeds Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops 
 The first time he struck down half of the Persian army The second time 
 pursuing the Persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers The third 
 time he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army The Persians who were 
 still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to Nakhichevan And so from 
 this remainder find how many Persian soldiers there were before the  
massacre
 

Answer a  a  

Corollary Armenians strike slaughter destroy and massacre After all
           they are not as innocent as the asala network claims

DEPOSITION OF ZAVEN ARMENAKOVICH BADASIAN

   Born 
   Employed
   Sumgait Bulk Yarn Plant

   Resident at Building  Apartment 
   Microdistrict No 
   Sumgait Azerbaijan


On February  my wife and I went to Baku to go shopping and returned to 
Sumgait at around five in the evening We ran into one of my relatives at the 
bus station and got to talking A lot of people had gathered not far away
near the store Well at first we didn't know what was happening and then a
fellow I know comes up to me an Azerbaijani guy and says What are you
standing here for Go home immediately I asked What's going on He says 
What's the matter can't you see they've overturned a car and they're 
killing Armenians He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely

We sat at home for two days During that time a gang of bandits came into our 
courtyard But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building There were 
about  of them They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands They
were shouting something but you couldn't understand it It wasn't one voice 
or two all of them were shouting in a chorus They turned toward Building 
They went up to the third floor and we see that they're breaking glass and 
throwing things out the window After a while they come out the entryway one 
has a pair of jeans in his hands another has a tape recorder and a third a 
guitar They went on toward the auto parts store

We had to save ourselves After midnight on March  we went to hide at School 
No  which is in Microdistrict  There were two other Armenian families 
there with us There were  of us altogether Out of all of them I had only 
known Ernest before he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad The Azerbaijani 
guard at the school let us in At first he didn't want to but there was 
nowhere else for us to go We had to plead with him and talk him into it We 
were told that on that day the st there would be an attack on our 
microdistrict

We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor

On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be
used to summon assistance or communicate anything important I called one of 
them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered I
asked him for assistance I say We're in School No  we need to be 
evacuated Well he says Got it wait there I'm sending out help now

I know his voice The First Secretary had been to our plant I had spoken with
him personally When I called he said Muslimzade here

About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school We looked out
the window and about  to  people were outside saying Armenians come 
out we're here to get you They have clubs axes and armature shafts in 
their hands The guard sat there with us and asked Where should I go I 
say If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that 
the Armenians were here and that they left That's what he did He went down 
there and said The Armenians were here he said I let them out the back 
door they went that way And pointed with his hand And with shouts and 
noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed

So the assistance we had been promised did come They sent us help all right
Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own I am positive that
Muslimzade did that No one had seen us entering the school no one knew that 
we were there In any case we stayed at the school until seven in the 
morning and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid

In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict  and the soldiers 
took us to the SK club from there The club was jammed with people and there 
were lots of people ahead of usthere was no space available One small boy 
about three months old died right in my arms There wasn't a single doctor 
nothing The boy was uninjured there were no wounds or bruises on him He was
just very ill They gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation they did everything
they could under the circumstances but were unable to save him And his 
mother and father a young Armenian couple were right there on the floor 

I searched for a spot for us in the SK we have a small child of our own I
wanted to find a room or something to put my family in I went up to the third
floor there were a lot of soldiers up there bandaged with canes limping 
with their heads broken open They were a terrible sight Young guys all of 
them

There were a lot of bandaged Armenians too Everyone had been beaten 
everyone was crying wailing and calling for help I think that the City
Party Committee ignored us completely True there was a snack bar a sausage 
was  kopeks or  kopeks a package of cookies that cost  kopeks was being
sold for  a bottled soft drink cost a ruble    But there was no way to 
get the things any cheaper

I met my old uncle Aram Mikhailovich there He saw me and tears welled up in
his eyes My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples that we 
worked together he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house And now he saw 
me and there was nothing he could say he just cried You can understand his 
feelings of course

  Look Mr Atakan I have repeated it in the past and I shall repeat it once
  more that when it comes to how Greeks are treating the Turks in Greece
  you and your copatriots should simply shut up

  Because what you are hearing is simply a form of propaganda from your ethnic
  fellows who studied at the Greek universities without paying any money for
  tuition food and helth insurance

  And any high school graduate can put down some simple math and compare the
  grouth of the Turkish community in Greece with the destruction of the Greek
  minority in Turkey

 Aykut Atalay Atakan

  Panos Tamamidis
 
                   Mr Tamamidis
 
 Before repling your claims I suggest you be kind to individuals
 who are trying to make some points abouts human rights discriminations
 and unequal treatment of Turkish minority in GREECEI want the World
 know how bad you treat these people You will deny anything I say but
 It does not make any difrence because I will write things that I saw with
 my eyesYou prove yourself prejudice by saying free insurance school
 etc Do you Greeks only give these things to Turkish minority or
 everybody has rights to get themYour words even discriminate
 these people You think that you are giving big favor to these
 people by giving these thing that in reality they get nothing
 If you do not know unhuman practices that are being conducted
 by the Government of the Greece I suggest that you investigate
 to see the facts Then we can discuss about the most basic
 human rights like fredom of religion
If you did not see with your 'eyes' freedom of religion you
must ne at least blind 
 fredom of press of Turkish
 weeks ago I read the interview of a Turkish journalist in a GReek magazine
he said nothing about being forbiden to have Turkish press in Greece 
 minority ethnic cleansing of all Turks in Greece
Give as a brake You call athnic cleansing of apopulation when it doubles
 freedom of
 right to have property without government intervention
What do you mean by that  Anyway in Greece as in every  country if you want
some property you 'inform' the goverment 
 fredom of right to vote to choose your community leaders
Well well well When Turkish in Area of Komotini elect  out of 
represenatives of this area to GReek parliament if not freedom what is it
 out of   Maybe there are only Turks living there 
 how Greek Government encourages people to destroy
 religious places houses farms schools for Turkish minority then
 forcing them to go to turkey without anything with them
I cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported
A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places which
were protected by the Greek police Photographs of Greek policemen 
preventing Turks from this non brain minority were all over Greek press
 Before I conclude my writing let me point out how Greeks are
 treated in Turkey We do not consider them Greek minority instead
 we consider a part of our society There is no difference among people in
 Turkey We do not state that Greek minority go to Turkish universities
 get free insurance food and health insurance because these are basic
 human needs and they are a part of turkish community All big businesses
 belong to Greeks in Turkey and we are proud to have themunlike the
 Greece which tries to destroy Turkish minority We encourage all
 minorities in Turkey to be a part of Turkish society


Oh NO PLEASE DO GIVE AS A BRAKE 
Minorities in Turkish treated like that  YOur own countrymen die
in the prisons every day bacause of their political beliefs an this
is reported by Turks and you want us to believe tha Turkey is the paradise
of Human rights   Business of Greeks i Turkey Yes  years ago 
You seem to be intelligent so before presenting Turkey as the paradise of
Human rights just invastigate this matter a bit more

   Andy Beyer has claimed that the Israeli Press is a bit biased
But the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the
mideast that people who do not read the Israeli press simply know
nothing about  Many of these events are not even mentioned here
I read the Israeli press to learn of important events about which
you know nothing because of your total reliance on western media
for your information on Israel  Since I read both American media
and Israeli media I can say with absolute certainty that anybody
who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about
Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on

   As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased of course they
are  Some may lean to the right or the left just like the media
here in America  But they still report events about which people
here know nothing  I choose to form my opinions about Israel and
the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American
who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report
on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy

Dear Josh

I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions

Having said that I am not totally happy with your answers

   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards
identify the holders as Jews or Arabs You imply that US
citizens must identify themselves by RACE Is that true  Or are
just trying to mislead the reader  

I think he is trying to mislead people  In cases where race
information is sought it is completely voluntary the census
possibly excepted

A high rank Israeli officer was killed during a clash whith a Hamas

and then his fantasy begins

Mujahid  The terrorist Israelis chased and killed a young Mujahid
using antitank missiles  The terrorist zionists cut the Mujahid's
body into small pieces to the extend that his body was not recognized
At leat ten houses were destroyed by these atnitank missiles



Anas Omran




This clearly is a fantastic story Anas  I am very curious as to who
or what your sources are for this grossly exaggerated account if not
blatant lie  It surprises me that this story has not yet made it to
the front pages of the major newspapers which love to make the State of
Israel look as evil as humanly possible  Such a story would be eaten up
by some of the papers over here  So please explain to me why I have never
seen nor heard of it before   Believe me I'm not expecting a reply because
we both know where the story came from YOUR DREAMS

 There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report
 on the situation in the OT  But as most people used to see on TV the
 Israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the OT  The Israelis 
 used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters  
 So this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine
 They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in Palestine

Please list the names of some of those neutral reporters that were killed
in the OT  It is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of
the intifada palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their
demonstrations for the benefit of the media  Having spoken to a Danish
reporter who covered the initfada I know of at least one case where
he found out that a mass demonstration on the outskirts of Gaza was
setup for himself and his colleagues  When I asked whether the footage
shot was sent he replied affirmatively after all it did happen
When this became the case the IDF began closing sensitive trouble
spots to reporters

Subject Unconventional peace proposal

A unconventional proposal for peace in the MiddleEast
 by
			  Elias Davidsson
Having stated my assumptions I will now state my proposal

      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants
for each child born to a couple where one partner is IsraeliJew
and the other PalestinianArab

      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'
marriages in IsraelPalestine all of whom would have relatives on
'both sides' of the divide would make the conflict lose its
ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a
truly civil society The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of
people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the

    Sounds just like a racial theory that Hitler outlined in Mein Kampf

Someone else said something similar  I will not comment on the
value or lack of value of Elias's proposal  I just want to say
that it is very distressing that at least two people here are
profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine  They were NOT
like Elias's idea they were more like the opposite  

Nazis believed in racial purity not racial assimilation  An 
instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies  According to 
Nazi theoreticians Gypsies were an Aryan race  They were persecuted
and in huge numbers murdered because most European Gypies were
considered not pure Gypsies but mongrels formed from the pure Gypsy 
race and other undesirable races  This was the key difference between 
the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies by the way  It is also 
true that towards the end of WWII even the purist Gypsies were 
hunted down as the theory was forgotten

for your information on Israel  Since I read both American media
and Israeli media I can say with absolute certainty that anybody
who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about
Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on

Of course you never read Arab media

I read Arab ISRAELI Jer Post and this network is more than enough
and Western American French and British reports and I can say
that if we give Israel  and Arabs  on the bias scale of course
you can switch the polarities Israeli newspapers will get either
a  or  American leading  newspapers and TV news range from 
to  yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis
The Montreal suburban a local free newspaper probably is closer
to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers British
range from  neutral to  French that Iknow of of course range
from  Afrofrench magazines to  Arab official media range from
 to  Egyptian  to  in SA Why no  Because they do not want to
overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since 
they are doing nothing

 
   As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased of course they
are  Some may lean to the right or the left just like the media
here in America  But they still report events about which people
here know nothing  I choose to form my opinions about Israel and
the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American
who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report

the average bias of what you read would be probably around 
while that of the average American would be the same if they do
not read or read the newyork times and similar Newsmakers and

 I recently read that during Bill Clinton's campaign he stated
 that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
 Israel's capital  According to the article Mr Clinton
 reaffirmed this after winning the presidency  However
 during recent talks with President Mubarak Secretary of
 State Christopher stated that the status of Jerusalem
 will be a final matter of discussion between the parties
 
 Now I don't want to start a big discussion over the status
 of Jerusalem  All I want to know is if anyone can 
 authenticate Mr Clinton's statements with dates places etc
 

This would be one of the results of US backed  PEACE process

 Thank you

                      THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH
  
      Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training
 videotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions the military

As opposed to Israel's many ways of death Using bombers and artillery
against Lebanese towns and villages Using fire arms and lethal
variants of tear gas and rubber coated bullets against stone
throwers Using tanks and antitank missiles against homes after a 
minute evacuation warning  Using Shin Bit's reasonable physical
pressure in interrogation And more Not counting of course past 
practices such as the bombardment of Beirut in  the bombing of the 
Egyptian school of BahrElBakar and the AbuZa'bal factory in 
the downing of the Libyan airliner full of Egyptian passengers near
the same time Overseeing the Maronite massacre in Sabra and Shatilla
That is of course besides numerous massacres by Irgun and other gangs
during the British mandate period

Ironically the same OpEd page in the NYT times from which the Naftaly
copied this article was running another article next to it by AM
Rosenthall blaming Bosnian Muslims for their own genocide by effectively
saying that it is stupid to seek independence if independence will bring
your people slaughter But what else would one expect from Mr Rosenthall
who never wasted a chance to bash Arabs or Muslims

  Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover 
  Israel should totally back down Sothe easiest way to get away with 
  attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the 
  other respects innocent lives
 
  Tell me Tim what are these guerillas doing wrong Assuming that they are 
  using civilians for cover 
 
 Assuming Also come on Brad If we are going to get anywhere in 
 this or any discussion it doesn't help to bring up elements I never 
 addressed nor commented on in any way I made no comment on who is 
 right or who is wrong only that civilians ARE being used as cover 
 and that having been placed in between the Israelis and the guerillas
 they will be injured as both parties continue their fight

Pardon me Tim but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail
to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which
killed the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and 
whereabouts of all of them Several villages were shelled How could the IDF
possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted
villages You see it was an arbitrary act of retaliation


  If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel is it not working Why
  is it further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages Why 
  not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone You see there 
  is more to the shelling of the villages it is called RETALIATION 
  GETTING BACKGETTING EVEN It doesn't make sense to shell the 
  villages The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli 
  government for the lives of civilians
 
 I agree with you here I have always thought that Israel's bombing
 sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane AND
 ineffective BUT there is no reason that Israel should passive wait 
 until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that
 taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks 
 
 As I said previously Israel spent several decades sitting passively
 on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after
 the attackers had entered Israeli territory It didn't work very well
 The host Arab state did littlenothing to try and stop these attacks 
 from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks
 were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact 
 on the civilians caught in their path  

The problem Tim is that the original reason for the invasion was Palestinian
attacks on Israel NOT Lebanese attacks 

 
  WhatSo the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states 
  can start all over again While I also hope for this to happen it will
  only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are prepared to take on the 
  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their 
  soil They have to Prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way
  Israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of 
  tolerance towards antiIsrael guerillas inresidence
  
  If Israel is not willing to accept the word of others then IMHO it has
  no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks 
 
 This is just another selectively applied statement
  
 The reason for this drawnout impasse between AbabsPalestinians and Israelis
 is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other By your
 criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations
 
 That is precisely why the Palestinians in their recent PISGA proposal for 
 the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are
 demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already They DO
 NOT trust that Israel will follow through the entire process and allow
 Palestinians to reach full autonomy 
 
 Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians 
 If you do then why should Israel's view of ArabsPalestinians 
 be any different Why should they trust the ArabPalestinians' words
 Since they don't they are VERY reluctant to give up tangible assets 
 land control of areas in exchange for words For this reason
 they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have 
 that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached

First I believe that my statement applies to both sides

Having said that I think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately
negotiable and what is not For example no country has the right to abuse
one's human rights Deciding whether there will be one or two states in
Palestine is a legitimate question While de facto one state exists Israel 
must treat all within its domain equitably

  Tim you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been
  disarmed Hezbollah remains the only independent militia Hezbollah does
  not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up
  Sheikh Mosavi his wife and young son 
 
 While the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars
 have been removed the weapons needed to crossborder attacks still
 remain to some extent Rocket attacks still continue and commando
 raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard
 for human life yours of that of others Such attacks also continue

Yes I am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify
occupying your neighbor's land Israel must resolve its disputes with the
native Palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks

  Of course if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon
  and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't
  make the Lebanese so mad as to do that
 
 Bat guano The situation you call for existed in the s and attacks
 were commonplace

Not true Lebanese were not attacking Israel in the s With a strong
Lebanese government free from Syrian and Israeli interference I believe
that the border could be adequately patrolled The Palestinian heavy
weapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a
threat as once existed

Please Tim don't fall into the trap of treating Lebanese and Palestinians
as all part of the same group There are too many who think all Arabs or all
Muslims are the same Too many times I have seen people support the bombing
of Palestinian camps in retaliation for an IDF death at the hands of the
Lebanese Resistance or the shelling of Lebanese villages in retaliation for
a Palestinian attack

That Federal land and tax money could have been used to commerate

Subject Re Final Solution in Palestine 
Lines 


OK its my turn

       DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA 

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed
to Islamic movements and the PLO it simply can't be proven as part of their
plan 


May I suggest you chech out the Palestinian National Covenant   It may
not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the
same message is being issued  Later on when I get back home I will try to find
the precise sections but you can do the research for now I hope  I also
realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the Covenant to the Western media only
but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact
intentions on this issue  Therefore as far as we are concerned the Covenant
still stands as the Bible so to speak of the mainstream Palestinian
National movement


Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity
since it was coined by Bnai Brith

As a staunch proIsrael activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT
influenced my opinions on the ArabIsraeli conflict  As I mentioned above
just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar
conclusion on the Palestinian National movement the PLO in most cases  BB
does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share
my views


What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in as far as I can get from the Arab media
is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic
Law This would be a reversal of the  situation in which the Jews in
Palestine took control of the land and its mostly Muslim inhabitants


What  situation  A negative situation I presume  Is this the same
situation when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the
Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM  Was this an example of
Qu'ranic law being exercised  If not I have another suggested reading for
you get into the socculturearabic newsgroup where the posters have been
debating the topic Jews in the Qu'ran and may I remind you the people doing
the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran
You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran to put
it lightly  So how do you think Jews or any other nonIslamic religion will
be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran  I think
the  situation in Jerusalem will return at best  What do you
think

However whoever committed crimes against humanity torture blowing up their
homes murders must be treated and tried as a war criminal The political
thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the
Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice

All I have to say to that is once again see sca  Jews in the Qu'ran and
think again  Freedom of choice is definitely not an option in Qu'ranic
law especially for nonMuslims and ALL women  Remember the Gulf War  I'm sure
you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia an Islamic
state


As for the PLO I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind


Probably nothing  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren
that the Covenant is null and void without getting assassinated himself

Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true
superpower in the region the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the
Jews used to establish their state  Religion


In conclusion Ahmed you should go to the library and find the Palestinian
National Covenant  and read it VERY CAREFULLY  By the way Redpath
Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I
was doing my research  So enjoy the reading and I hope we will be hearing back
from you soon

 This is nonsense I lived in the Negev for many years and I can say
 for sure that no Beduins were moved or harmed in any way On the
 contrary their standard of living has climbed sharply many of them
 now live in rather nice permanent houses and own cars There are
 quite a few Beduin students in the BenGurion university There are
 good friendly relations between them and the rest of the population

  Dear Mr Beyer
  
  It is never wise to confuse freedom of speech with freedom
  of racism and violent deragatory
  
  It is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial 
  distinction
 
 	In fact if a speach was not offensive to some its
 protection under Freedom of speach laws would be useless It is
 speach that some find questionable that must be protected be
 it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist It is only
 through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can
 enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant That is the
 idea behind freedom of expression
 	What you find offensive might be perceived as truth by
 some and what they might find offensive might be your belief
 It is only through free exchange of ideas and insults as the
 case seems to be with this channel that one can change
 another's erring waysThat is why Jefferson said that here 
 we are not afraid to tolerate error so long as reason is left to 
 combat it 

Those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin aren't curtailing
anyones' freedom of speech  The neonazi movement has a right to
make speeches say anything they want  They do not have a right
to have these speeches published by the NY Times  That depends
on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent
newsworthy value of those speeches  Likewise to the sysadmin
of this fellows system  If he feels his resources are being
used in a manner that is not in his best interests or are
perhaps embarassing to his organization he will act just as
the New York Times does not to be a conduit for these ideas
The poster is after all freeloading off of someone else's
pocket book when he posts  He who controls the purse strings
has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds
spent or not spent

Noone is going to put the poster in jail unless he bombs a local
building as a symbol of his hatred  Freedom of Speech in no
way equates to accessibility to conduits of information  The
market of ideas has its own natural selection process that
weeds out the gaga from the credible ideas that are of
importance

  Well Panos Mr Tamamidis the way you put it it is only the Turks
  who bear the responsibility of the things happening today That is hard to
  believe for somebody trying to be objective
  When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
  blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides
  What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW anyway
  Do you think it was your right to be there

I've heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they don't read about
itRemember the Treaty of Sevresas a consequence of being in the Axis powers
in WWIThe Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their
minorities ie GreeksArmeniansKurdsI must say TurkKurd relations are 
improving slightly with time and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours
The Turks blatantly rejected this treatythe Germans grudgingly accepted 
Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the 
German peopleThe Greeks who had an army therewere there with BRITISH
and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres
    In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government
managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak alliesthis was after 
the Greek forces were were destroyed at SmyrnaWhen this occurred incidently
FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the 
FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH
as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships
Libertaeegalitaefraternatae
 
 There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor until 
 Someone had to protect them If not us who
 
  I am not saying that conflicts started with that It is only
  not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
  It is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
  I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
  visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey I thought it
  was a positive attempt to make the relations better
  
 Compromise on what the invasion of Cyprus the involment of Turkey in
 Greek politics the refusal of Turkey to accept  miles of territorial
 waters as stated by international law the properties of the Greeks of 
 Konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the Greek lakesorry Aegean
 
 There are some things on which there can not be a compromise
 
 
  The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
  people They have never met me but they know I am bad person
  because I am from Turkey Politics is not my business and it is
  not the business of most of the Turks When it comes to individuals 
  why the hatred
 
 Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or
 indirecly is a bad person
 It is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support of the
 actions of your goverment that make you bad
 People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you
 are You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and
 as a such you must pay the price
 
  So that makes me think that there is some kind of
  brainwashing going on in Greece After all why would an educated person 
  treat every person from a nation the same way can you tell me about your 
  history books and things you learn about GreekTurkish
  encounters during your schooling 
  take it easy

  Achtung baby
 
 You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks Just talk to
 Greeks Arabs Slavs Kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under
 Turkish occupation
 They will talk to you about murdersrapesdistruction
 
 You do not learn about Turks from history books you learn about them from
 people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness

Well Napoleon It is your kind of people who are preventing peace 
on the world First of all you didn't answer the question I asked
at the end of my posting And then you told me some bullshit
throughout your posting which had no positive point about the issue
filled with hatred and filled with emotions Why am I doing this
Forget it I don't think you are worth it to discuss the issue

The fact that Israel is already discussing with some Palestinians what the composition
of the armed Palestinian Police Force in the territories will be during the transition
phase indicates some real solid concessions and liberal thinking on the part of the
Israeli side

'April rd' 


 In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul
  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us
  create for ourselves It certainly is possible to severe the artificial
  lifesupport system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us
  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats 
  in this alien land
            Sahak Melkonian    Preserving the Armenian purity 


During the First World War and the ensuing years   
the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic 
genocide tried to complete its centuriesold policy of 
annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 
 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their  year 
homeland

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the th Century acted upon an entire people
This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government
and international political leaders such as US Ambassador Mark 
Bristol William Langer Ambassador Layard James Barton Stanford

Still living in an alternate universe Numerous articles in major newspapers

        Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander
        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War
        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov

The things I have heard and seen during the two months until the
 liberation of Erzurum by the Turks have surpassed all the
 allegations concerning the vicious degenerate characteristic of
 the Armenians During the Russian occupation of Erzurum no Armenian
 was permitted to approach the city and its environs

 While the Commander of the First Army Corps General Kaltiyin remained
 in power troops including Armenian enlisted men were not sent to the
 area When the security measures were lifted the Armenians began to 
 attack Erzurum and its surroundings Following the attacks came the
 plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder
 of the owners of these housesPlundering was widely committed by
 the soldiers This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers
 who had remained in the rear during the war

 One day while passing through the streets on horseback a group of
 soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of
 seventy years in a certain direction The roads were covered with mud
 and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud
 and dirt

 It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and
 traps The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds
 and withdrew The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night
 patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them The 
 Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear
 also Finally the Court Martial which had been established for the
 trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for
 fear that they themselves would be punished The incidents of murder
 and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently

 Sometime in January and February a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir
 Efendi from Erzurum was killed one night at his home The Commander
 in Chief Odiselidge gave orders to find murderers within three days
 The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals
 that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its
 highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half
 of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned

 We learnt the details this incident from the CommanderinChief
 Odishelidge They were as follows

 The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the
 act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades
 More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been
 killed in Erzincan Large holes were dug and the defenceless 
 Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes Later the
 murdered Turks were thrown into the holes The Armenian who stood 
 near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses
 'Seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more' Thus ten
 more Turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when
 the hole was full it would be covered over with soil

 The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently
 fill a house with eighty Turks and cut their heads off one by one
 Following the Erzincan massacre the Armenians began to withdraw
 towards Erzurum The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew
 to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road and
 destroyed the entire population together with the villages

 During the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages
 that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the 
 Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages While the travellers
 were passing through Erzurum the Armenians took advantage of the time
 when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill
 the Kurds they had hired When the Russian soldiers heard the cries
 of the dying Kurds they attempted to help them However the 
 Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would
 have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from
 acting All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with
 hatred and loathing

 Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that
 he witnessed in Erzurum as follows An Armenian had shot a Kurd The
 Kurd fell down but did not die The Armenian attempted to force the
 stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd However since
 the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the Armenian failed
 in his attempt Having seen this the Armenian ripped open the abdomen
 of the Kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping
 him with the iron heel of his boot

 Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape
 from the village of Ilica were killed Their heads had been cut off
 by axes He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered
 children Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov who passed through the village
 of Ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following

 There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads
 Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and
 spat on the corpses In the courtyard of a mosque which was about
 x meter square dead bodies were piled to a height of  
 centimeters Among these corpses were men and women of every age
 children and old people The women's bodies had obvious marks of
 rape The genitals of many girls were filled with gunpowder

 A few educated Armenian girls who worked as telephone operators
 for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov
 to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be 
 proud of what the Armenians had done To the lieutenant colonel's
 disgusted amazement the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle
 instead of being horrified The lieutenant colonel had severely
 reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour When he told
 the girls that the Armenians including women were generally more
 licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent
 and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity
 and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers
 the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and
 claimed they had laughed because they were nervous

 An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command
 narrated the following incident which took place on February 

 The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall They had cut
 out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head
 The great massacre in Erzurum began on February  The enlisted men 
 of the artillery division caught and stripped  people Then they
 took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts  people
 among this group were able to save their lives as the result of
 my decisive attempts The others the Armenians claimed were 
 released when they learnt that I understood what was going on 
 Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the
 Armenian officers Karagodaviev Today some Turks were murdered
 on the streets

 On February  some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent
 Moslems The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were
 threatened with death Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for
 murdering an innocent Turk 

 When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would 
 be hanged for his crime the killer shouted furiously 'How dare
 you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk' In Erzurum the 
 Armenians burned down the Turkish market On February  I heard
 that the entire population of Tepekoy village situated within
 the artillery area had been totally annihilated On the same 
 day when Antranik entered Erzurum I reported the massacre to
 him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible
 act However no result was achieved

 In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was a
 natural silence On the night of  February the Armenians deceived
 the Russians perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the 
 Turkish soldiers Later it was understood that this massacre had
 been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular 
 The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed
 one by one The number of murders committed on that night reached
 three thousand It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details
 of the massacre The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers
 were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even
 withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred
 people and two cannons for one night and ran away The leading
 Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre
 However the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with
 the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others The lower
 classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders
 of the leading Armenian figures and commanders 

 I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals
 were accessories to these murders No for there were people who
 opposed the Armenians for such actions since they understood that
 it would yield no result However such people were only a minority
 Furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian
 cause Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have
 supported the massacres secretly Some on the other hand preferred
 to remain silent There were certain others who when accused by
 the Russians of infamy would say the following 'You are Russians
 You can never understand the Armenian cause' The Armenians had a
 conscience They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear
 of the Turkish soldiers

Since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either Arab or 
Palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn 
Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another

There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report
on the situation in the OT

	A neutral organization would report on the situation in
Israel where the elderly and children are the victims of stabbings by
Hamas activists  A neutral organization might also report that
Israeli arabs have full civil rights

The Israelis used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these
neutral reporters

	Care to name names or is this yet another unsubstantiated
slander 

So this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine
They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in Palestine

	Terrorism as you would know if you had a spine that allowed
you to stand up is random attacks on civilians  Terorism includes
such things as shooting a cripple and thowing him off the side of a
boat because he happens to be Jewish  Not allowing people to go where
they are likely to be stabbed and killed like a certain lawyer killed
last week is not terorism

It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it 
without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible 
enough to make provisions for them but rather just leaving
them to their fate

If a landlord sells an apartment building vacant to another landlord
and fails to notify his tenants they just might find themselves out
on the street all of a sudden  The seller may be a scoundrel and a
crook but this doesn't make the buyer a thief as Israelis are so
often called here on tpm

It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the
palestinians were shafted Do many Israelis or Jews share
your opinion   Do you  absolve the purchaser from
any ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down 

I don't know if others share this opinion  It is mine
and I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't
The way I see it the fallahin were caught in circumstances 
beyond their control in that since they didn't own the land
they didn't have a say Of course now for the sake of the greater 
Arab unity the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews
an act that is illegal in Jordan but when it happened it was just 
business   

The Arabs that lived along the coast in Western Palestine later to be
called Israel were shafted by their brother Arabs just as they've
been shafted for decades since then by their Arab bretheren  Somehow
though the Arab call has continued to blame Israel not only for the
Syrian landowner sellout in Western Palestine Israel but even for
the occupation of Eastern Palestine Jordan by the Hashemites  This
is just more of refusing to take blame for one's own actions

infrastructure etc IMHO the Palestinians have grounds
to contest the legality of the purchase say in world court

If your job was eliminated in a corporate takeover you could probably
go to court too  You'd probably lose though

It seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested
who is behind the Center for Polict Research I will oblige

Trumpets please

My name is Elias Davidsson Icelandic citizen born in Palestine My
mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'
at that times this group was defined as 'Jews' She was forced to go
to Palestine due to many  cynical factors 

Forced to go to Palestine  How dreadful  Unlike other
undesirablesJews she wasn't forced to go into a gas chamber forced
under a bulldozer thrown into a river forced into a Medical
experiment like a rat forced to march until she dropped dead burned
to nothingness in a crematorium  Your mother was forced to go to
Palestine  You have our deepest sympathies

I have meanwhile settled in Iceland  years ago 

We are pleased to hear of your escape  At least you won't have to
suffer the same fate that your mother did

and met many people who were thrown out from
my homeland Palestine 

Your homeland Palestine  

because of the same reason they belonged to
the 'indesirables' 

Should we assume that you are refering here to Jews who were kicked
out of their homes in Jerusalem during the Jordanian Occupation of
East Jerusalem  These are the same people who are now being called
thieves for reclaiming houses that they once owned and lived in and
never sold to anyone

These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem
with the children of whom I played as child Their crime Theyare
not Jews 

I have never heard of NOT being a Jew as a crime  Certainly in
Israel there is no such crime  In some times and places BEING a Jew
is a crime but NOT being a Jew

My conscience does not accept such injustice period 

Our brains do not accept your logic yet either

My
work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism
and racial discrimination Those who protest against such practices
in Arab countries have my support  as long as their protest is based
on a principled position but not as a tactic to deflect criticism
from Israel 

The way you've written this you seem to accept criticism in the Arab
world UNLESS it deflects criticism from Israel in which case we have
to presume you no longer support criticism of the Arab world

The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal

Look who's taling about discrimination now

The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities
undertaken under my guidance in different domains and which command
the support of many volunteers in Iceland It is however not a formal
institution and works with minimal funds

Be careful  You are starting to sound like Barfling

Professionally I am music teacher and composer I have published 
several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe

I would hope that discussion about IsraelPalestine be conducted in
a more civilized manner Calling names is not helpful

Good  Don't call yourself ARF or the Center for Policy Research
either

recognize the statement that these private funds were all tax exmpt  In

The donations are tax deductible like any donations to a nonprofit
organization  I've donated money to a group restoring streetcars
and it was tax deductible  Why don't you contribute to a group
helping the homeless if you so concerned

I do did contribute to the ARF mortgage fund but when interest
rates plumetted I just paid it off

The problem is I couldn't convince Congress to move my home to 
a nicer location on Federal land

BTW even though the building is alleged to be funded by tax exempt
private funds the maintainence and operating costs will be borne by 
taxpayers forever

Would anyone like to guess how much that will come to and tell us why
this point is never mentioned

Today marks the th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of
 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and xSoviet
Armenia The following letter which represents a small portion 
of the full text along with more than  pages of historical 
documents scholarly sources eyewitness accounts and photographs 
was sent to President Bill Clinton members of Congress editors 
program directors and columnists of major newspapers journals and 
radioTV stations for the th anniversary of the Armenian genocide 
of  million Muslim people On April  of every year the people 
of Turkiye remember their dead They grieve for lost family and the 
lost homes of their grandfathers This year the Turkish Nation is 
mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their 
lives generously and with altruism so that the future generations 
may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and 
prosperously

 letter 

During the years of World War I the xSoviet Armenian Government 
has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people which 
not only took the lives of  million Muslim people but was also the 
method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants To this day 
Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the xSoviet Armenia In order 
to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland 
which is the crux of Turkish political demands fascist xSoviet Armenia 
continues its antiTurkish policy in the following ways

 xSoviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility

 xSoviet Armenia employing ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish 
Genocide

 xSoviet Armenia has also implemented statesponsored terrorism through
the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests

 Using all its human financial and governmental resources xSoviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism bribery and other subversive methods nonTurkish supporters
of the Turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian

Using all the aforementioned methods the xSoviet Armenian Government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue

Yet despite the efforts of the xSoviet Armenian Government and its 
terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks 
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically 
exterminated by the Armenians the international wall of silence on 
this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of 
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition 
of the Turkish Genocide

With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages the Turkish and Kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle therefore the victims
of the Turkish Genocide demand

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government as the heirs of the Armenian 
Dictatorship recognize the Turkish Genocide

 that xSoviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government make material reparations for 
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide

 that all world governments and especially the United States officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure

 that the US Government free itself from the friendly position it 
has adopted towards its unreliable ally xSoviet Armenia and officially 
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be 
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands

 that the xSoviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact 
of the Turkish Genocide and include the coldblooded extermination of 
 million Muslim people in their history books

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first 
genocide of the th century as a positive step Furthermore a new 
generation has risen  equipped with a deep sense of commitment politically
mature and conscious who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause through
all necessary means ranging from the political and diplomatic to the 
armed struggle Therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon
all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in 
the political cultural and religious activities of the th Anniversary
of the Armenian genocide of  million Muslim people

The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks
The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza some  people by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel

Anyone who can repeate this choice piece of tripe without checking
hisher sources does not deserve to be believed  The Gaza strip does
not possess the highest population density in the world  In fact it
isn't even close  Just one example will serve to illustrate the folly
of this statement  the city of Hong Kong has nearly ten times the
population of the Gaza strip in a roughly comparable land area  The
centers of numerous cities also possess comparable if not far higher
population densities  Examples include Manhattan Island NY City Sao
Paolo Ciudad de Mexico Bombay 

Need I go on  The rest of Mr Davidsson's message is no closer to the
truth than this oftrepeated statement is

What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum  It is the home of
the muslim a s well as jewish religion among others

	Israel has a right to keep Jerusalem for many reasons  They
include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli the
fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people and the
historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem

	When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 
the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit
religious shrines  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan
who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control  The
Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city  They turned a
Jewish cemetary into a hotel and used the gravestones in their
latrines

	Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into
Jerusalem protected holy sites and demonstrated its fitness to
control the city

	Also I should point out that Islam is not centered in
Jerusalem but has holy sites there  The home of Islam is Mecca
where all Muslims should make a pilgramage the hajj  Unlike Israeli
Jerusalem Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca

Israel allows freedom of religion

   For your information Islam permits freedom of religion  there is
no compulsion in religion  Does Judaism permit freedom of religion
ie are nonJews recognized in Judaism  Just wondering

	In Islam there is no compulsion just a tax on dhimini  In
Judaism nonJews are allowed to do as they wish and there is no

DD The second time pursuing the Persians he slaughtered one fourth of the

Koc Corollary Armenians strike slaughter destroy and massacre After
Koc all they are not as innocent as the asala network claims

Fact I didn't notice any mention of Turks in Shirak Van or Trebizon in
      this seventh century story

Fact These places were filled with Armenians as of 

Fact By the end of  after the Turkish genocide of the Armenians there
      were no Armenians left in Shirak Van or Trebizon  only Turks and

      either

The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population

	Hong Kong and Cairo both have higher population densities

The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza some  people by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel

	There is no fundamental right to work in another country  And
the closing of the strip is not a punishment it is a security measure
to stop people from stabbing Israelis


The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

	Dozens minus one since one of them was stabbed to death a few

       DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA 

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed
to Islamic movements and the PLO it simply can't be proven as part of their
plan 

This has been discussed before by several people on this net  The
statement is attributable either to Hajj Amin alHusseini former Grand
Mufti of Jerusalem  and the leader of the Palestinian death squads
during the  war or to one of his chief henchmen  

It was not coined by B'nai B'rith or for that matter any Jewish
organization

Zionism and the Holocaust
 by Haim Bresheeth

The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history
of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without
antisemitism is impossible Zionism agrees with the basic tenet
of antiSemitism namely that Jews cannot live with non Jews

	Wrong  Zionism acknowledges the fact that antiSemites
exist and prevent Jews from living in peace  That does not mean we
agree that Jews are all greedy that Jews kill Christian Children
commited deicide or anything else  We acknowledge that there are
morons out there who do believe these things

The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks
The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza some  people by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel

Anyone who can repeate this choice piece of tripe without checking
hisher sources does not deserve to be believed  The Gaza strip does
not possess the highest population density in the world  In fact it
isn't even close  Just one example will serve to illustrate the folly
of this statement  the city of Hong Kong has nearly ten times the
population of the Gaza strip in a roughly comparable land area  The
centers of numerous cities also possess comparable if not far higher
population densities  Examples include Manhattan Island NY City Sao
Paolo Ciudad de Mexico Bombay 

Need I go on  The rest of Mr Davidsson's message is no closer to the
truth than this oftrepeated statement is

Elias' initial statement certain is hot air But it seems to be
almost standard procedure around here to first throw out an absurb
overstated image in order to add extra meaning to the posting's
real point 

However his second statement is quite real The essential sealing off
of Gaza residents from the possibility of making a living has happened
Certainly the Israeli had a legitimate worry behind the action they took
but isn't that action a little draconian

   OK its my turn

	  DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA 

   I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed
   to Islamic movements and the PLO it simply can't be proven as part of their
   plan 

   Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity
   since it was coined by Bnai Brith

   What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in as far as I can get from the Arab media
   is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic
   Law This would be a reversal of the  situation in which the Jews in
   Palestine took control of the land and its mostly Muslim inhabitants

   However whoever committed crimes against humanity torture blowing up their
   homes murders must be treated and tried as a war criminal The political
   thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the
   Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice

   As for the PLO I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind

   Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true
   superpower in the region the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the
   Jews used to establish their state  Religion


   Ahmed

Forget the syntax Ahmed and focus on the semnatics The fact is that
the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist This is perfectly
obvious from the PLO covenant Cairo  The covenant calls for
the destruction of the Zionist entity As far as I know the
Israeldestruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies
the purpose for the existence of the PLO If you would like I can
post the relevant caluses

Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical it seems I know it has been
posted here several times and while I do not have a copy of it I am
sure that someone does and he or she of course would be more than
happy to repost it

Regardless of phrasing groups like Hamas and the Hezbollah and
even the newly moderate and politicallycorrect PLO have at the very
heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel

It just seems to me that Mr Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support
people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing
one to many Jews

 Of course you never read Arab media

I don't though when I was in Israel I did make a point of listening
to JTV news as well as Monte Carlo Radio  In the United States
I generally read the NYT and occasionally a mainstream Israeli
newpaper

 I read Arab ISRAELI Jer Post and this network is more than enough
 and Western American French and British reports and I can say
 that if we give Israel  and Arabs  on the bias scale of course
 you can switch the polarities Israeli newspapers will get either
 a  or  American leading  newspapers and TV news range from 
 to  yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis
 The Montreal suburban a local free newspaper probably is closer
 to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers British
 range from  neutral to  French that Iknow of of course range
 from  Afrofrench magazines to  Arab official media range from
  to  Egyptian  to  in SA Why no  Because they do not want to
 overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since 
 they are doing nothing

What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer
representative of the mainstream in Israel  It was purchased a few
years ago and in the battle for control most of the liberal and
leftwing reporters walked out  The new owner stated in the past
more than once that the JP's task should be geared towards explaining
and promoting Israel's position more than attacking the gov't Likud
at the time  The paper that I would recommend reading being middle
stream and factual is HaAretz  or at least this was the case two
years ago

 the average bias of what you read would be probably around 
 while that of the average American would be the same if they do
 not read or read the newyork times and similar Newsmakers and
  if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased newspapers

And what about the Nat'l Enquirer 
But seriously if one were to read some of the leftist newspapers
one could arrive at other conclusions  The information you received
was highly selective and extrapolating from it is a bad move

 Problem 
 
 My father told me the following story During the famous wars between the 
 Armenians and the Persians prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary
 heroic deeds Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops 
 The first time he struck down half of the Persian army The second time 
 pursuing the Persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers The third 
 time he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army The Persians who were 
 still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to Nakhichevan And so from
 this remainder find how many Persian soldiers there were before the  
 massacre
 

Answer a  a  

Corollary Armenians strike slaughter destroy and massacre After all
           they are not as innocent as the asala network claims

   Hmm  Turks sure know how to keep track of deaths but they seem to
lose count around  million

today   Finally if Israel wants peace why can't it declare what
it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a
base for negotiations Having all the above facts in mind one
cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism as a
number of wars have proved    

Oh yeah Israel was really ready to expand its borders on the holiest day
of the year Yom Kippur when the Arabs attacked in   Oh wait you
chose to omit that warperhaps because it  supports the exact 
OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make  I don't think that it's
because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest  Also in  it was
Egypt not Israel who kicked out the UN force  In  it was the Arabs
who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET
BY THE UNITED NATIONS  In  Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli
shipping a clear antagonistic act  And in  the attack was a response
to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan
Heights  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel
finally retaliated  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that 
the borders could be expanded

In a previous article cprigcapcorg Center for Policy Research says

 Your answer to the question concerning rights to return
conflicts with what I was told namely that hundreds of thousands
of nonJews who left for some reason or other the area under
Israel control during the war of  were prevented from
returning for the sole reason they were not Jews Jews who also
left for example to Europe to avoid the clashes were allowed to
return How can you justify such discrimination if this is true 
Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge
somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in
his homeland 

You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the
Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel join with the Arab armies so that
after what they felt like an assured victory occured these Arabs could
return to their former homes reclaim them as well as anything else they
wanted that belonged to Jews  When the Arabs lost Israel was left with
a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back
into the country as citizens  What would you have done  Let them in so
they could kill Jews  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens 
because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave  Of
course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing
between the two is impossible  Therefore a decision was made based on
secuturity of the country

  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in
Israeli kibbutzim I wonder how many and where There is very
little evidence available about that As much as I know many
Arabs are working for kibbutzim even for many years but are
not accepted as members Could it be that kibbutzim do not want
Arabs 

No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any employees unless they had to
hire some people for the restaurants hotels etc if there weren't enough 
people ON the kibbutz to do them  In such cases they are paid properly
If a kibbutz turns away an Arab I have never seen or heard of this but it
reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz not the whole
kibbutz movement

to keep it what way' I am certain that if only religious
communities in the US would be asked they would gladly abolish
civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests
to officiate marriages But Israel has always been ruled by a
secular majority Your answer is not satisfactory

This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics  Although the 
major parties in Israel aren't religious however not totally secular
due to the format of the government coalition the religious parties have
always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition
In fact from what I heard the present government is the least influenced
by the religious parties in the existance of Israel  Israel CANNOT be
called a secular state  For instace Haifa is the only city in the country
except for maybe some Arab cities where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath  
There are many other examples of religion in Israel  Marriages in Israel
are NOT contolled by the state but by Rabbis and Priests  Obviously your 
disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country
you claim to know so much about

Subject Ten questions to Israelis

Dear Shai

Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory

In the answer to my first question concerning the nonexistence of
Israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information I have
received from other quarters according to which there are two
distinct categories of classifying Israelis  Citizenship
Ezrahut and Nationality Le'um The former is used on passports
etc and the later for daily identification in Israeli society I
am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all
times and present them at many public places almost every day
These ID cards make clear who the holder is a Jew or an Arab
You maintain that this mainly because of religious services
provided But do you really believe that this is the reason 
Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it
serves no other purpose 

In the answer to my second questions concerning the fact that
Israel has no fixed borders you state that Israel's borders were
'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace' According to what I
read the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century had
plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into
Transjordan Jordan I also read that it was the express wish of
BenGurion to not declare Israel's borders when Israel was
established as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for
later expansion Israel often claims it right of existence on the
fact that Jews lived there  years ago or that God promised the
land to them But according to biblical sources the area God
promised would extend all the way to Iraq And what were the
borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use
today   Finally if Israel wants peace why can't it declare what
it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a
base for negotiations Having all the above facts in mind one
cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism as a
number of wars have proved    

Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public
official I don't think your answer is honest  You refer me to
Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without
evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations Now if he said
the truth then why should he been punished and if he lied why
should he be punished I would appreciate more honesty

Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question concerning
'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons He posted an article from
Ma'ariv documenting such cases  It seems that such prisoners do
exist in Israel What do you think about that 

You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a
way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel' Such terms have often been
used by the Soviet Union against dissidents They call the Soviet
Union into disrepute If my questions are not disturbing they
would not call forth such hysterical answers My questions are
clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts I would be
very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about
Israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed to do so
I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest
discussion This is a sign of weakness not of strength

I hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth

Subject rejoinder Questions to Israelis


Dear Josh

I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions

Having said that I am not totally happy with your answers

   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards
identify the holders as Jews or Arabs You imply that US
citizens must identify themselves by RACE Is that true  Or are
just trying to mislead the reader  Do you know of any democratic
country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or
religious identity to any public official who so requests 

  The answer to the second question is evasive There are all
kinds of maps issued  They are not equivalent to State policy
You did not respond to my question

  Your answer to the third question Israeli nuclear arsenal is
interesting You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear
weapons What evidence have you for maintaining that 

  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a
Ma'ariv article documenting such cases I did not ask about cases
like Vanunu everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned but about
those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and
imprisoned

  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status
of the inhabitants of the occupied territories From it I
understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares one for
the occupier civil law and one for the occupied military law
The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron it seems If so
why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel 

 Your answer to the question concerning rights to return
conflicts with what I was told namely that hundreds of thousands
of nonJews who left for some reason or other the area under
Israel control during the war of  were prevented from
returning for the sole reason they were not Jews Jews who also
left for example to Europe to avoid the clashes were allowed to
return How can you justify such discrimination if this is true 
Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge
somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in
his homeland 

  Somebody answered my question regarding Y Rabin signing an
order for ethnical cleansing in  According to that
information Y Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all
inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh about  people  These
expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other
atrocities which remind Bosnia I was referred to a book by
Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the
Palestinian Refugee Problem published by Cambridge University
Press Is this book available in your library 

  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in
Israeli kibbutzim I wonder how many and where There is very
little evidence available about that As much as I know many
Arabs are working for kibbutzim even for many years but are
not accepted as members Could it be that kibbutzim do not want
Arabs 

  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was
whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to
discourage intermarriage You did not address this question but
evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants
to keep it what way' I am certain that if only religious
communities in the US would be asked they would gladly abolish
civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests
to officiate marriages But Israel has always been ruled by a
secular majority Your answer is not satisfactory


I would be glad to have some more input from you after these
comments

Elias

    First of all I never said the Holocaust I said before the
    Holocaust I'm not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more
    about Nazi Germany than most people maybe including you 
   
   Uh Oh  The first sign of an argument without meritthe stating of one's 
   qualifications in an area  If you know something about Nazi Germany 
   show it  If you don't shut up  Simple as that
   
    	I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII
    justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government Any
    attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is
    not appreciated
   
   ALL Jews suffered during WWII not just our beloved who perished or were 
   tortured  We ALL suffered  Second the namecalling was directed against
   YOU not civillibertarians in general  Your namedropping of a fancy
   sounding political term is yet another attempt to cite qualifications 
   in order to obfuscate your glaring unpreparedness for this argument  Go 
   back to the minors junior
  	All humans suffered emotionally some Jews and many
  others suffered physically It is sad that people like you are
  so blinded by emotions that they can't see the facts Thanks
  for calling me names it only assures me of what kind of
  ignorant people I am dealing with I included your letter since
  I thought it demonstrated my point more than anything I could
  write 
 
 
 When you're willing to actually support something you say with fact or 
 argument rather than covering up your own inadequacies with feigned 
 offense let me know  Otherwise back to your own league son
  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles  This
Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism yet
because he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion you
attack him  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's
question in an intelligent and unoffending manner  The only
ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact
are the Israelophiles  Now will we please start having some
INTELLIGENT conversation  You all are an insult to you race
assuming you are also semitic
	Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
during the 's and 's  The Hirgun and other branch 
off militant groups did fight the British do get them out of
Palestine  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
favor of a compromise with the Palestinians  In addition they
massacred an entire Palestinian village in  contributing
to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their
very lives
	I mention this not because I'm anti semitic I'm part
Jewish but because this self righteousness on the part of the
Israelites pisses me off so  I'm not as critical of the
Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
Jews  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for
German and European anti semitism

 I think the Israeli press might be a tad bit biased in
 reporting the events I doubt the Propaganda machine of Goering
 reported accurately on what was happening in Germany It is
 interesting that you are basing the truth on Israeli propaganda
 
 If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda then 
 consider the Washington Post's handling of American events to be propoganda
 too  What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion  I
 wouldn't compare it to Nazi propoganda either  Unless you want to provide
 some evidence of Israeli inaccuracies or parallels to Nazism I suggest you 
 keep your mouth shut  I'm sick and tired of all you antisemites comparing
 Israel to the Nazis and yes in my opinion if you compare Israel to the Nazis
 you are an antisemite because you know damn well it isn't true and you are
 just trying to discredit Israel
 
 Ed
 
You know ed  You're right  Andi shouldn't be comparing
Israel to the Nazis  The Israelis are much worse than the
Nazis ever were anyway  The Nazis did a lot of good for
Germany and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the
damn Jews  The Holocaust never happened anyway  Ample
evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard Dept of History
and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU have shown that the
Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel

   Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest
points I would still like to know why do do not ask any question
of this sort about the Arab countries

   If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours your
fixation on Israel must stop  You might have to start asking the
same sort of questions of Arab countries as well  You realize it
would not work as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the
last several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would
begin to look like the biased attack that it is

   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for
Policy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot
who hates Israel

   Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel  I
have heard that your family once lived in Israel but the members
of your family could not cut the competition there  Is this true
about your family  Is this true about you  Is this actually not
about Israel but is really a personal vendetta  Why are you not
the least bit objective about Israel  Do you think that the name
of your phonybaloney center hides your bias in the least  Get a
clue Mr Davidsson  Haven't you realized yet that when you post
such stupidity in this group you are going to incur answers from
people who are armed with the truth  Haven't you realized that a
piece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a
truth  Haven't you realized that you are in over your head  The
people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or
need them to be  This is not the place for such pseudoanalysis
You will be continually ripped to shreds until you start to show
some regard for objectivity  Or you can continue to show what an
antiIsrael zealot you are trying to disguise your bias behind a
pompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research'  You ought to
know that you are a laughing stock your 'Center' is considered a
joke and until you either go away or make at least some attempt
to be objective you will have a place of honor among the clowns

 	What I resent is ignorant statements that call people
 names when they disagree with your position Opposing the
 atrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies
 as antisemitism If you think name calling is a valid form of
 argument in intellectual circles you need to get out more
 often
 
  Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German
  Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance high intellect
  low humanity none and antisemitism average I respect anybody
  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a
  civilized manner I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel
  andor its politics is an antisemite except he uses antisemitic
  vocabularyterminologydemagogy Israel is not a perfect country and
  its politicians also commits errors even some of them are corrupt
  like politicians in any other country but they carry a huge burden
  to care for the safety of ALL its citizens and that is really not an
  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect
  that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country and its
  Jewish citizens plus the socalled collaborators arabs that wanted to
  live in peace with their Jewish neighbours of the map As I said
  Israel is not a perfect country but it is the ONLY democracy in the
  whole MiddleEast and the only country in the world where Jews from
  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries
  they are living
  Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on nonJewish
  nations and its governments as soon as there are more or les big
  socialeconomicalpolitical problems in any country the first ones
  that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews and later the other
  minorities of the country
  
 I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII
                     
 justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government Any
 attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is
 not appreciated

  This is really outrageous  murdered Jews besides the
  thousands  who survived the Shoa in some way or another and the rest
  of the living ones mourning for all of them  I don't know what you
  call a Civil Libertarian never heard about them but I know only
  one thing if all of them think like you do it then Civil Libertarians
  is a new denomination for Antisemites May other Civil Libertarians come
  to word to this group so that we can learn if ABeyer and me are right
  that Civil Libertarians are Antisemites or that I'm wrong and he is

It is never wise to confuse freedom of speech with freedom
of racism and violent deragatory

It is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial 
distinction

I couldn't agree more  Canada has an antihate law which exists to punish
those who wilfully spread false propaganda lies for the purpose of 
putting down another group  This is actually the law that David Irving
will hopefully be found guilty under due to his denial of the Holocaust
It's too bad that this useless Centre for Policy Research isn't in Canada

 To  shaigThinkCOM
 
 Subject Ten questions to Israelis
 
 Dear Shai
 
 In the answer to my first question concerning the nonexistence of
 Israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information I have
 received from other quarters according to which there are two
 distinct categories of classifying Israelis  Citizenship
 Ezrahut and Nationality Le'um The former is used on passports
 etc and the later for daily identification in Israeli society I
 am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all
 times and present them at many public places almost every day
 These ID cards make clear who the holder is a Jew or an Arab
 You maintain that this mainly because of religious services
 provided But do you really believe that this is the reason 
 Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it
 serves no other purpose 

A number of points  You are making assumptions about the manner
in which the cards are used  True by law all residents citizens
and tourists must carry a form of identification with them  For
citizens the standard ID is the ID card  The purpose this serves
on a daily basis wherein they are presented at public places
is for the purpose of identifying the bearer  This takes place
in banks cashing checks post offices registered mail and such etc
Quite frankly it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card
for such activities more than once per week  There is no law or
requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public
Furthermore none of the services I outlined discriminate against
the bearer in any manner by having access to this information

The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might
be taken into account is during interaction with the police
based upon the scenario  In general though arab citizens are
clearly recognizable as are nonarabs Your argument therefore
becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field
is being used to discriminate against them officially


 In the answer to my second questions concerning the fact that
 Israel has no fixed borders you state that Israel's borders were
 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace' According to what I
 read the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century had
 plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into
 Transjordan Jordan I also read that it was the express wish of
 BenGurion to not declare Israel's borders when Israel was
 established as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for
 later expansion Israel often claims it right of existence on the
 fact that Jews lived there  years ago or that God promised the
 land to them But according to biblical sources the area God
 promised would extend all the way to Iraq And what were the
 borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use
 today   Finally if Israel wants peace why can't it declare what
 it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a
 base for negotiations Having all the above facts in mind one
 cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism as a
 number of wars have proved    

I take issue with your assertions  I think that Arab countries
do know that they have nothing to fear from Israeli expansionism
Militarily Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of
land under occupation to a hostile armed and insurgent population for a
sustained period of time  As is the intifada is heavily taxing
the Israeli economy  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon  Israeli troops pulled back from the
Awali and later from the Litani in order to control the minimal
strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire
Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada
via territorial concessions  The Israel public is sufferring from
battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it

With regards to borders let me state the following  I may not agree
with the manner in which negotiations are being held however the crux
of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating
a starting position  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal
and a return to pre borders  If Israel were to state large borders
the negotiations might never get under way  If Israel were to state
smaller borders then the arab countries might try and force even smaller
borders during the negotiations  I think that leaving the matter to be
settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic
and sensible

 Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public
 official I don't think your answer is honest  You refer me to
 Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without
 evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations Now if he said
 the truth then why should he been punished and if he lied why
 should he be punished I would appreciate more honesty

Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a center for
policy research  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no
bearing on the fact that some were  For disclosing state secrets
after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that
said secrets are not to be made public one should be punished
As to which were and which weren't I am under no moral obligation
to disclose that  quite the reverse in fact
He was taken to court tried and found guilty  You may take issue
with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the
concept of Secrets of state something which every democratic govt
has

 Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question concerning
 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons He posted an article from
 Ma'ariv documenting such cases  It seems that such prisoners do
 exist in Israel What do you think about that 

I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist
more than he documented the fact that they do exist  The CLU noted
which you evidently did not pay attention to that they know of no such
reports or cases  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of  mill
as tightly knit as Israel even if the matter of the arrest was not
made public within a relatively short time frame most people would know
about it  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be
made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours
This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an
announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation

 You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a
 way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel' Such terms have often been
 used by the Soviet Union against dissidents They call the Soviet
 Union into disrepute If my questions are not disturbing they
 would not call forth such hysterical answers My questions are
 clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts I would be
 very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about
 Israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed to do so
 I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest
 discussion This is a sign of weakness not of strength

Well I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted  Such
questions are often termed tabloid journalism and are not
disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity
Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as
a basis for the witchhunts that took place then  To use
your own example these questions might have been lifted
from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking
for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray
as a larger and dirtier picture

My answers were not any more hysterical than the questions
themselves  The problem is not that the q's were provocative
it was that they were selective in their fact seeking  You
fall into the same category of those who seek yes no answers
when the real answer is of sorts
I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an
unequivocal NO you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete
them as you see fit  A sign of strength is the ability to look
You remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated
culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer only to find that they
had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment
they sought to protect  The color blindness you exhibit is a true
sign of weakness

 I hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth

 million Muslim people

p  first paragraph

In those Moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for
 arms by the Armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such
 search and not only had many Moslems been killed but horrible tortures 
 had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where
 valuables had been hidden of which the Armenians were aware of the 
 existence although they had been unable to find them

p  first paragraph

The arrival of this British brigade was followed by the announcement
 that Kars Province had been allotted by the Supreme Council of the
 Allies to the Armenians and that announcement having been made the
 British troops were then completely withdrawn and Armenian occupation
 commenced Hence all the trouble for the Armenians at once commenced
 the wholesale robbery and persecution of the Muslem population on the
 pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms
 In the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able
 to carry out their purpose and the manner in which this was done will
 be referred to in due course

 Well ZUMABOT claims just the opposite That Greeks are not allowing
Turks to exit the country Now explain this The number of Turks in
Thrace has steadily risen from  in  to  while the Greeks of

Dr Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally 
be believed I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing 
Goebels' rule quite loyally 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks 
who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news However in today's 
informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves For 
instance those who lived in  will remember the TV news they 
watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can 
read the American newspapers of July and August  to find out what 
really happened 

There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital The Greek Girls' Lycee 
Alumni Association the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society 
the Greek Medical Foundation the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation 
the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation and the Fener Greek 
Men's Lycee Foundation  

As for Greece the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' 
in titles and on signboards is prohibited The Greek courts 
have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association 
the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti 
Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks
in Western Thrace Such community associations had been 
active until  But they were first told to remove
the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official
papers and then eventually close down This is also the 
final verdict November   of the Greek High Court

In the city of Komotini a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish
parentage was sentenced recently to  months of imprisonment
with no right to appeal just for saying outloud that he was
of Turkish descent This dulyelected ethnic Turkish official
was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three 
years Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than 
a vehicle used by the Greek governments to coverup their inferiority 
complex they display visavis the people of Turkiye 

The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks' 
which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference 
to 'Muslims' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the 
existence of a few thousand nonTurkish Muslims does not change the 
essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger 
Turkish minority The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people whom all the 
three nations Bulgarians Turks and Greeks consider as part of 
themselves Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized 
according to the agreements Poor 'Poly'

It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece 
and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world
The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish
minority They pursue the same denial in connection with 
the Macedonians of Greece Talk about oppression In addition
in  the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No 
virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and
other charitable trusts They have ceased to be selfsupporting
religious and cultural entities Talk about fascism The Greek 
governments are attempting to appoint the muftus irrespective
of the will of the Turkish minority as state official Although
the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in
Greece the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing
its religious leaders Talk about democracy

The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic 
convention in Komotini Such destruction which reflects an 
attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage is a 
violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'socalled' 
Greek Constitution which is supposed to guarantee the protection 
of historical monuments 

The government of Greece on the other hand is building new 
churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward 
Hellenizing the region

And you pondered Sidiropoulos the president of the Macedonian Human 
Rights Committee became the latest victim of a tactic long used by 
the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation 
of the Macedonian minority A forestry official by occupation 
Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of 
Kefalonia hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina 
His employer the Florina City Council asked him to depart in 
 hours The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his 
involvement in Copenhagen He returned to Florina by his own choice 
and remains without a job 

Helsinki Watch a wellknown Human Rights group had been investigating 
the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece In August  their 
findings were published in a report titled 

 'Destroying Ethnic Identity Turks of Greece'

The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the 
Turkish minority by the Greek authorities It says for instance 
the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in 
Komotini Such destruction which reflects an attitude against 
the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the 
Lausanne Convention 

The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik
were attacked and tombstones were broken The cemetery in
Karotas was razed by bulldozers

Shall I go on Why not The people of Turkiye are not going 
to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government The 
discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not 
stop at the Greek frontier In several following articles 
I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks
in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians

It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration 
has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made 
plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it 
has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on 
conventional arms reductions in Europe Meanwhile Greek 
and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned 
to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the 
transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern 
Cyprus a process that will conflict with the spirit of 
the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe

An acceptable method may certainly be found when there
is a will But we know of various kinds of violent
behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning
of buildings The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were 
dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there 
Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana

Now wait there is more

  The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus
   and the  Turkish travellers men and women who were in it ordered
   to descend And there in the open street under the eyes of their

   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated

    The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the
   following manner Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire
   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt
   end of a gun

    During the firing of the town eleven children six little girls
   and five boys fleeing from the flames were stopped by Greek soldiers
   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter and thrown into a burning Jewish house
   near bridge where they were burnt alive This fact is confirmed on oath
   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it

    The clockmaker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and
   dragged out of their shop The son had his eyes put out and was then
   killed in the court of the Greek Church but Ahmed Effendi has been
   no more heard of

Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians Nazi Armenians were of service 
to Germans in Arab countries as well As Uzun put it one wellknown 
case which received a lot of mediacoverage involved two Nazi Armenian 
agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes The mission 
of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and 
to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied 
forces in the area Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda 
efforts in Arab countries designed to promote proNazi sentiments among 
the French and Britishruled Arab populations Beirut had traditionally
been stronghold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was
the center of international Armenian terrorism 

In Russia General Dro the Butcher the architect of the Turkish
genocide in WWI was working closely with the German Secret

	Actually Jarmo is a permanent resident of my killfile

Anyone care to speculate on this I'll let the rest of the net judge
this on its own merits Between  and   million Turks perished 
of butchery at the hands of Armenians The genocide involved not only 
the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian 
Armenia They were persecuted banished and slaughtered while much of 
Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I The Genocide Treaty defines 
genocide as acting with a 

  'specific intent to destroy in whole or in substantial part a 
   national ethnic racial or religious group' 

History shows that the xSoviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate 
the Muslim population  million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the 
Armenians International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time  including 
US Ambassador Bristol  denounced the xSoviet Armenian Government's policy 
as a massacre of the Kurds Turks and Tartars The bloodthirsty leaders of 
the xSoviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the 
extermination of the Muslims The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor 
those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians 

The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established
beyond any doubt that the massacres against the Muslim people
during the war were planned and premeditated The aim of the policy
was clearly the extermination of all Turks in xSoviet Armenian 
territories

The Muslims of Van Bitlis Mus Erzurum and Erzincan districts and
their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed
The massacres in Trabzon Tercan Yozgat and Adana were organized and
perpetrated by the bloodthirsty leaders of the xSoviet Armenian 
Government

The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were

Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning
 with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken
 in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated When the Russian army
 withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian
 massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked
 in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places
 selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs
 were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
 being subjected to every conceivable abominable act A very small part 
 of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the
 cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering
 from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived
 in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to
 Including women and children such persons discovered so far do not
 exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in
 Erzurum All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled everything
 that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them
 in a destitute situation At the present time the people are subsisting
 on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from Russian storages
 left behind after their occupation of this area

         Secondly The Turks are also asking for their money for 
         their destroyed and confiscated properties in Greece and 
         formerYugoslavia Bosnia and Serbia

Classic 

It is called 'The Justice' We also demand that the xSoviet Armenian 
Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish 
Genocide render reparations to the Muslim people and return the 
land to its rightful owners The recognition of the Genocide has 
become an issue which cannot be delayed further and it is imperative 
that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed

Now if we're talking about rent and vandalism let's make it fair then 
Greece pays back it's dues and Turkey pays for  years rent and 
destruction of classical architecture Deal Democracy in action

Are you the 'truelove' or 'falselove' of 'Arromdian' of the ASALASDPAARF
Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle 

If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the
nations which they brought under their power to which no one could have
opposed today there would be no Eastern problem But Turks did not do so 
They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody to worship in their own
way centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum Thus
in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when 
people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs
differed from theirs the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the
inquisition did not exist where deaths at the stake were unheard of and 
where accusations of witchcraft were not made And the barbarian  Turkey
was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere
by the Christians could find asylum These facts demonstrate that Muslim
countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian
countries

The Turks who are a conquering nation did not Turkify the nations that came
under their rule instead they respected their religions and traditions It
was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of
Russian or Austrian rule Because otherwise there would not have been a
Romanian nation today Popescu Ciocanel

Turks rule over people under their administration only externally without
interfering with their internal structures On account of this the autonomy
of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most
advanced European countries

human beings hate each other on account of religious differences This flaw
is older than Islam and Christianity But there has never been any examples
of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account
of his religion If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of
simple contempt among us too or if it did not keep translating itself into
action many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves
happy A de Mortraye

Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the
inquisition On the contrary it served as an asylum for the unfortunate
victims of Christian fanaticism If you look into history you will see that
in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and
Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been
living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years
and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the
cruelty of Christians especially that of the Orthodoxes No Jew is able to
appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens even today In Turkey
however if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities
local courts immediately take them under their protection

In that vast and calm country of the sultan all religions and nations are
living together peacefully Although the mosque is superior to the church and
the synagogue it does not replace them Because of this the Catholic sect is
more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon In addition 
to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the openair ceremonies of this 
sect neither does any law imprison its cross in the church While the
dead are being taken to the graves a long line of priests bear processional
candles and chant Catholic hymns When all the priests in all the churches in
the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical
processions during the Eucharist celebrations chanting hymns and bearing
their crosses and religious banners a detachment of soldiers escorts them
which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of 
priests A Ubicini

    Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin

    There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII
 
    Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more
 
    In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place
 
    People die that is all No one gets killed
 
    Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american
    napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all
 
    Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in therethey 
    may be thought it was like snifing cocaine No

 Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin But there was no massacre First
 of all the village housed many armed troops Secondly the Irgun
 and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians
 The village was attacked only for its military significance In fact
 a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before
 the attack was to begin
 
 By all rational standards Dir Yassin was not a massacre The killing

 To even compare Dir Yassin in which some  or so Arabs died to the
 Holocaust is absurd The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians The
 village had almost  inhabitants most of whom survived
 
 Harry
This is such Bullshit  Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on
the part of the Jews and a massacre defines it best in my
opinion  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the
Jews a peace pact but the Irgun purposely broke this
agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians  I might
grant that this village housed armed Arabs I doubt it but
nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun  The Deir Yassin
MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homelandand contrary to
your belief many civilians were killed  Deir Yassin was later
advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was
useful in getting many Palestinians to leave  The Palestinians
were rightfully scared off because they did not want another
Deir Yassin  
	I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here
atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs
Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are
and were the good guys in the middle east  Both Arab and Jew
suck equally

I agree with all you write except that Terrorist orgs were not shelling
Israel from the Golan Heights in  but rather from Lebanon The Golan
Heights have been held by Israel since  and therefore the PLO could
not have been shelling Israel from there unless there is something I am

Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin But there was no massacre First

Nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this  It does not
appear in several long published accounts by Irgun participants
Even some Irgun propagandists do not make this claim

Secondly the Irgun
and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians

Several members of the Irgun attacking party including the leader
deposited personal declarations in the Irgun archives Jabotinsky
Institute TelAviv which state that the Lehi proposed to liquidate
the village after the conquest  It seems the Begin overruled
this plan however the willingness of many of the attackers to
seriously consider this possibility serves as instructive
character evidence

The village was attacked only for its military significance 

The Haganah tried to get the Irgun to attack a village with
real military significance but it was considered too hard  
The soft target of Deir Yassin was chosen instead

In fact
a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before
the attack was to begin

There was intention probably originating with Begin to give such
a warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before
reaching the village  Everyone knows that

By all rational standards Dir Yassin was not a massacre 

By all rational standards you should be posting from bcpu

The killing
was unintentional The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops
Thus it was attacked for its military significance It was not
attacked with intentions of killing any civilians

A lie repeated is still a lie

To even compare Dir Yassin in which some  or so Arabs died to the
Holocaust is absurd The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians The
village had almost  inhabitants most of whom survived

From Myths and Facts by Leonard J Davis Near East Research Inc


pp 

    Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets the
 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin
on April   targeted the village for its military importance
Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem which the Arabs had

Since Facts and Myths doesn't even know where Deir Yassin was
why should we pay any attention to the rest of what it says

blockaded and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars
Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens
in Jerusalem

    Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin but that attack does
not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to
paint The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about
 In  however Eric Silver of The Guardian Britain
interviewed a survivor Mophammed Sammour who testified that  out
of a population of  were killed 'About three days after the
massacre' Sammour explained 'representatives of each of the five
clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a
list of the people who had not been found alive We went through the
names  Nothing has happend since  to make me think this figure
was wrong'

This account from Eric Silver is the only valid point that MF makes
You can find it together with other evidence and analysis in 
Silver's biography of Begin  Also in Silver's book you will find
documentary evidence that nearly everything else in MF's account
is pure bullshit

    Unlike the PLO's deliberate attacks on civilians the killing of
civilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated The attackers left open
an escape corridor from the village and more than  residents left
unharmed After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then fired
on the Jewish troops some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers and
civilians indiscriminately Independent observers told The Guardian
that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women

This is pretty disgusting  The Guardian was told of one or two
feeble old men who dressed in women's clothing in a pathetic 
attempt to escape death  See Silver's book

   There are many cases but I do not remeber names  The Isralis shot and killed
   a UN observer in Gaza in the first half of Intifada


Not exactly the same but reminiscent of the assassination of Count
Bernadotte who was the UN negotiator during the  Israeli war of
independence  He was killed by the Israelis  Seems he was being too
successful in negotiating a ceasefire which would have worked
territorially against the nascent Israel compared to continued war

were on the forefront of the civilrights movement  The Jewish
government of Israel rescued Jews ranging in skin color from White
Russian to Brown Yemenite to Black Ethiopian  Please Andi tell us
how the Jews are treating other races when they got power

It is unfortunate

Your ignorance and bias are indeed unfortunate

I am born in Palestine now Israel I have family there The lack of
peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life

Bullshit  You've been in Iceland for the past  years  You told us
so yourself  It had something to do with not wanting to suffer the
fate of your mother who has lived with Jews for a long time or
somesuch  Sounded awful

I am concerned by Palestine Israel because I want peace to come to
it Peace AND justice 

Are you as concerned about peace and justice in Palestine Jordan

Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical The first
party has a state and the other has none The first is an occupier and
the second the occupied 

Let's say that Israel grants the PLO EVERYTHING THEY EVER ASKED FOR
That Israel goes back to the  borders  What will the Palestinean
Arabs in TelAviv call themselves  The Palestineans in West
Jerusalem  In Haifa  Will they still claim to be occupied

Or do you suggest that Israel expell or kill off any remaining Arabs
much as the Arabs did to their Jews

Indeed there is much which is not symmetrical about the conflict in
the ME  And most of this lack of symmetry does NOT favor Israel

Contrary to BenGurion's assertion it must be affirmed that
during the  years of the British mandate over Palestine and for
centuries previous a productive human presence was to be found in
all parts of the Negev desert  in the very arid hills and valleys
of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north These
were the Bedouin Arabs

In fact this productive human presence in the desert has in the
centuries it has been there produced one of the greatest
civilizations in human history  They not only created the wheel but
the printing press the light bulb PostModern skyscraper
architecture Broadway theatre and nuclear power as well

The real desertification of the Negev mainly in the southern
part occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's
cultivated lands and pastures 

Right Elias  The Negev was a veritable Garden of Eden until the Evil
Jews turned off the rain and turned it into a horrible desert  Part
of the International Jewish Conspiracy  Say who should I call to
turn off the rain here in NY right now

Nowadays the majority of the
 squarekilometer Negev which represents  percent of the
State of Israel pre borders has been desertified beyond
recognition 

Yeah deserts rarely look like the Garden of Eden

The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev
are the Israeli army the Nature Reserves Authority whose chief
role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture
lands 

This is why Nature Reserves people are heavily armed with antitank
weaponry  Just what we need in the Nature Reserves

and vast industrial zones including nuclear reactors and
dumping grounds for chemical nuclear and other wastes 

Nothing like vast nuclear reactors when it comes to hiding them from
air attack  AT least Saddam had the sense to hide his CBN plants in
baby milk factories

Israeli
Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area
cultivated by the Bedouin before  and there is no Jewish
pastoral activity

Indeed many older people recall fondly those lovely tomatoes and
oranges that the Bedouin exported form their Garden of Eden  In fact
that region used to supply the entire world with bananas until the
Jews pushed that business onto the banana republics




Elias you're stupid postings are a source of considerable amusement
and hilarity  Please don't stop  I might even have to go back to
watching TV

You guys are funny It's funny to see people lose control and

Comparing Israel to Nazi Germany is namecalling of the lowest kind
Please don't be disingenuous

They civil libertarians would support the
Jews against the Nazis or anyone else who tries to oppress them
and they would support the Arabs against the Israelis and any
other such oppressive regimes Iraq etc 

Do civil libertarians make no distinction between the Nazis and
Israel  Would you say that the Iraqis are like the Nazis

If you do not make such distinctions then all injustices are
equally evil and the world is a completely evil place  In that
case we may as well give up right now

Can someone elaborate a little on what this Libertarian movement is I
am not going to draw conclusions from a small sample but so far I
recall two selfdescribed Libertarians posting here Both seems to be

 Incredibly ignorant
 Incredibly arrogant
 All they want is to get people angry
 Posses a lousy sense of humor
 write incoherently and jump from topic to topic without any logical
   connection between topics
 Describe themselves as intelligent and knowledgeable although everything
   in their posters points to the opposite
 Very childish

Is this some campaign to smear this Libertarian party or what

Owwww  Mr Jefferson would be clearly disappointed in your designation of 
him as author of the bill of rights  And your reference to those
in Israel was condesceding and inappropriate
The Declaratio of Independence of  was written by Thomas Jefferson
In  the Constitution was drafted by  men in Philadelphia
In  the Bill of Rights was added  Well maybe Jefferson
would be flattered

As to you guys at UVA your right not all of you are antiJewish
or selfhating  But when I visited Charlottesville I noticed
a distinct lack of diversity from which I must assume you garner
your inability to perceive the reality of the outside world

   Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No 
   Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office

   Resident at Building B Apartment 
   Microdistrict No 
   Sumgait Azerbaijan

Note The events in Kafan used as a pretext to attack Armenians in 
 Azerbaijan are false as verified by independent International Human Rights
 organizations  DD

I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in
Armenia now We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fatesthe
price was too great Now after the Sumgait tragedy we the victims divide
our lives into before and ''after We talk like that that was before the
war Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole
epoch a fate No matter how many years go by no matter how long we live
it will never be forgotten On the contrary some of the moments become even 
sharper in our rage in our sorrow we saw everything differently but now
   They say that you can see more with distance and we can see those
inhuman events with more clarity now    we more acutely perceive our
losses and everything that happened

Nineteen eightyeight was a leap year Everyone fears a leap year and wants it
to pass as quickly as possible Yet we never thought that that leap year would
be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian those who lost someone and 
those who didn't

That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family although you 
could already smell danger in the air But we didn't think that the danger was
near and possible so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves At least as
my parents say at least we should have done something to save the children 
My parents themselves are not that old  and  years But then they thought
that they had already lived enough and did everything they could to save us

In our apartment the tragedy started on February  around five in the
afternoon I call it a tragedy and I repeat it was a tragedy even though all
our family survived When I recall how they broke down our door my skin
crawls even now among Armenians among people who wish me only well I feel
like it's all starting over again I remember how that mob broke into our 
apartment    My parents were standing in the hall My father had an axe in 
his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors Our door was rarely 
locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by We're known as a 
hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people 
who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis Jews or Russians We had friends
of many nationalities even a Turkmen woman

My parents were in the hall my father with an axe I remember him telling my 
mother Run to the kitchen for a knife But Mother was detached pale as 
though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer To be honest I never 
expected it of her she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark A 
girlfriend was at the house that day a Russian girl Lyuda and Mamma said 
No matter what happens no matter what they do to us you're not to come out 
of the bedroom We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment

We went into the bedroom There were four of us Marina and the Russian girl 
crawled under the bed and we covered them up with a rug boxes of dishes and
Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another The idea that 
perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside 
me I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately I wanted to
embrace her and kiss her as though it were the last second And maybe Karina 
was thinking the same thing but she's quite reserved We didn't have time to 
say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout 
There was so much noise from the tramping of feet from the shouting and from
excited voices I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door
to the bedroom was only open a crack But when Mamma shouted the second time
Karina ran out of the bedroom I ran after her I had wanted to hold her back
but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us 
immediately The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me at 
least so as to save Marina and her friend The mob was shouting all of their 
eyes were shining all red like from insomnia At first about  people burst
in but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see They 
came into the hall into the kitchen and dragged my father into the other 
room He didn't utter a word he just raised the axe to hit them but Mamma 
snatched the axe from behind and said Tell them not to touch the children 
Tell them they can do as they want with us but not to harm the children She
said this to Father in Armenian

There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in They 
understood Armenian perfectly The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian 
they don't need to speak it And one of them responded in Armenian You and 
your children both    we're going to do the same thing to you and your 
children that you Armenians did in Kafan They killed our women our girls 
our mothers they cut their breasts off and burned our houses     and 
so on and so forth and we came to do the same thing to you This whole time
some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us They 
were mostly young people under  At first there weren't any older people 
among them And all of their faces were unfamiliar Sumgait is a small town 
all the same and we know a lot of people by their faces especially me I'm 
a teacher

So they dragged my father into the other room They twisted his arms and took 
him in there no they didn't take him in there they dragged him in there
because he was already unable to walk They closed the door to that room all 
but a crack We couldn't see what was happening to Father what they were 
doing to him Then a young man about  years old started to tear off 
Mamma's sarafan and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani I'm old enough to 
be your mother What are you doing He struck her Now he's being held 
Mamma identified him I hope he's convicted Then they went after Karina 
who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader as though she were trying 
to lead them down a different path as they say to influence their 
consciousness She told them that what they were doing was wrong that they 
mustn't do it She said Come on let's straighten this out without 
emotions What do you want Who are you Why did you come here What did we 
ever do to you Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come 
into our home but then the ones in the backmore of them kept coming and 
comingsaid What are you talking to them for You should kill them We 
came here to kill them

They pushed Karina struck her and she fell down They beat her but she 
didn't cry out Even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeating What
did we do to you What did we do to you And even later when she came to 
she said Mamma what did we do to them Why did they do that to us

That group was prepared I know this because I noticed that some of them only 
broke up furniture and others only dealt with us I remember that when they 
were beating me when they were tearing my clothes off I felt neither pain 
nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina All I could do 
was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her and what they
did to her That's why I felt no pain Later when they carried Karina off 
they beat her savagely    It's really amazing that she not only lived but 
didn't lose her mind  She is very beautiful and they did everything they 
could to destroy her beauty Mostly they beat her face with their fists 
kicking her using anything they could find

Mamma Karina and I were all in one room And again I didn't feel any pain 
just didn't feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they 
did Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the
apartment They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the 
corners so there would be more room Then someone suggested Let's take her 
outside

Those beasts were in Heaven They did what they would do every day if they 
weren't afraid of the authorities Those were their true colors At the time 
I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't 
afraid of what would happen to them

When they carried Karina out and beat Mammaher face was completely covered 
with bloodthat's when I started to feel the pain I blacked out several 
times from the pain but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though 
I were recording it all on film I think I'm a kind person by nature but I'm 
vengeful especially if someone is mean to me and I don't deserve it I hold 
a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain And every time 
I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me I'd remember them 
and I'll remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me 
forget you have to forget you have to go on living

At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something and 
despite the fact that I hurt all overI had been beaten terriblyI found
the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures I realized that I had
to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering 
to an end I pushed one of them away he was a real horse I remember now that
he's being held too As though they were all waiting for it they seized me
and took me out onto the balcony I had long hair and it was stuck all over
me One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open and I realized that
they planned to throw me out the window because they had already picked me up
with their hands I was up in the air As though for the last time I took a 
really deep breath and closed my eyes and somehow braced myself inside I 
suddenly became cold as though my heart had sunk into my feet And suddenly 
I felt myself flying I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I 
just imagined it When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the 
ground And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was 
still lying on the floor And since I didn't scream didn't beg them at all
they became all the more wild like wolves They started to trample me with
their feet Shoes with heels on them and iron horseshoes like they had spe
cially put them on Then I lost consciousness

I came to a couple of times and waited for death summoned it beseeched it 
Some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment I didn't 
need any of those things I was sure that none of us would survive and I had 
even forgotten about Marina and if none of us was alive it wasn't worth 
living

There was a moment when the pain was especially great I withstood inhuman 
pain and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come 
because I had showed myself to be so tenacious I started to strangle myself 
and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to
put an end to their pleasures and they pulled my hands from my throat The 
person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well 
because he was the oldest in the group He looked around  I know that he 
has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person 
one who would never do such a thing Something came over him then you see 
even during the investigation he almost called me daughter he apologized 
although of course he knew that I'd never forgive him Something like that 
I can never forgive I have never injured anyone with my behavior with my 
words or with my deeds I have always put myself in the other person's shoes
but then in a matter of hours they trampled me entirely I shall never 
forget it

I wanted to do myself in then because I had nothing to lose because no one 
could protect me My father who tried to do something against that hoard of 
beasts by himself could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything
I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive

And Ira Melkumian my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a
couple of timesher brother tried to save her and couldn't so he tried to 
kill her his very own sister He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an 
end to her suffering When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into 
the other room her brother knew what awaited her I don't know which one it 
was Edik or Igor Both of them were in the room from which the axe was 
thrown But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her 
and made her death even more excruciating maybe the most excruciating of all 
the deaths of those days in Sumgait I heard about it all from the neighbor 
from the Melkumians' landing His name is Makhaddin he knows my family a 
little He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku
how we were feeling and if we needed anything He's a good person He said 
You should praise God that you all survived But what I saw with my own eyes
I a man who has seen so many people die who has lived a whole life I he
says nearly lost my mind that day I had never seen the likes of it and 
think I never shall again The door to his apartment was open and he saw 
everything One of the brothers threw the axe because they had already taken 
the father and mother out of the apartment Igor Edik and Ira remained He 
saw Ira naked being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven
people He told us about it and said he would never forget it He heard the 
brothers shouting something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that 
they were powerless to do anything But all the same they tried to 
do something The guy who got hit with the axe lived                                                                           I     I

After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and 
Lyuda out of the bedroom I was in such a state that I couldn't even 
remember my sister's name I wanted to cry Marina out to her but could
not I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar dear face but couldn't
for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was And thus
I saved her because when they were taking her out she as it turns out had
told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both
there by chance that they weren't Armenians Lyuda's a Russian you can tell 
right away and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that
she was an Azerbaijani And I almost gave her away and doomed her I'm glad 
that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health    
although her spirit was murdered   

At some point I came to and saw Igor Igor Agayev my acquaintance in that 
mob He lives in the neighboring building For some reason I remembered his 
name maybe I sensed my defense in him I called out to him in Russian Igor
help But he turned away and went into the bedroom Just then they were 
taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom Igor said he knew Marina and 
Lyuda that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani and he took both of them to the 
neighbors

And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment 
something like that but if he was my friend he was supposed to save me
 
Then they were striking me very hardwe have an Indian vase a metal one 
they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked outthey took me out 
onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window They were already 
sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows Someone 
said She's already dead let's throw her out When they carried me out onto
the balcony for the second time when I was about to die the second time I 
heard someone say in Azerbaijani Don't kill her I know her she's a 
teacher I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears but I can't remember
whose voice it was It wasn't Igor because he speaks Azerbaijani with an 
accent his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home He speaks
Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does I remember when they carried me in and
threw me on the bed he came up to me that person and 	I having opened my 
eyes saw and recognized that person but immediately passed out cold I had 
been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him I only 
remember that this person was older and he had a high position Unfortunately 
I can't remember anything more

What should I say about Igor He didn't treat me badly I had heard a lot 
about him that he wasn't that good a person that he sometimes drank too
much Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan He knew that 
women usually like bravery in a man Especially if a man was in Afghanistan
if he was wounded then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated
very sympathetically with respect Later I found out that he had served in 
Ufa and was injured but that's not in Afghanistan of course I found that 
all out later

Among the people who were in our apartment my Karina also saw the Secretary 
of the Party organization I don't know his last name his first name is 
Najaf he is an Armenianborn Azerbaijani But later Karina wasn't so sure
she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw and she 
didn't want to endanger him She said He was there and a little while 
later Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else 
No it seems like it was he I am sure it was he because when he came to see 
us the first time he said one thing and the next time he said something 
entirely different The investigators haven't summoned him yet He came to see
us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time He brought 
groceries and flowers this was right before March th he almost started 
crying he was so upset to see our condition I don't know if he was putting 
us on or not but later after we had told the investigator and they summoned 
him to the Procuracy he said that he had been in Baku he wasn't in Sumgait 
The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is 
right that in fact it was he who was in our apartment I don't know how the 
investigators are now treating him At one point I wondered and asked and was
told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment Couldn't he have gone 
to Baku and arranged an alibi I'm not ruling out that possibility

Ill now return to our apartment Mamma had come to You could say that she 
bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married her 
wedding band and her watch were gold She bought her own and her husband's 
lives with them She gave the gold to a year old boy Vadim Vorobyev A 
Russian boy he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly He's an orphan who was raised by
his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street He goes to a 
special school one for mentally handicapped children But I'll say thisI'm 
a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinionthat
boy is not at all mentally handicapped He's healthy he can think just fine 
and analyze too    policemen should be so lucky And he's cunning too 
After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album

He beat Mamma and demanded gold saying Lady if you give us all the gold 
and money in your apartment we'll let you live And Mamma told them where 
the gold was He brought in the bag and opened it shook out the contents and 
everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it started knocking each other 
over and taking the gold from one another I'm surprised they didn't kill one 
another right then

Mamma was still in control of herself She had been beaten up her face was
black and blue from the blows and her eyes were filled with blood and she 
ran into the other room Father was lying there tied up with a gag in his
mouth and a pillow over his face There was a broken table on top of the pil
low Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk like me he was half dead 
halfway into the other world He couldn't comprehend anything couldn't see 
and was covered with black and blue Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth 
it was some sort of cloth I think it was a slipcover from an armchair

The bandits were still in our apartment even in the room Mamma pulled Father 
out of led him out of carried him out of We had two armchairs in that room
a small magazine table a couch a television and a screen Three people 
were standing next to that screen and into their shirts their pants 
everywhere imaginable they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee
serviceMamma saw them out of the corner of her eye She said I was afraid 
to turn around I just seized Father and started pulling him but at the 
threshold I couldn't hold him up he fell down and I picked him up again and 
dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors' Mamma remembered one of the 
criminals the one who had watched her with his face halfturned toward her 
out of one eye She says I realized that my death would come from that 
person I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing
Later they caught that scoundrel Meanwhile Mamma grabbed Father and left

I was alone Igor had taken Marina away Mamma and Father were gone Karina 
was already outside I didn't know what they were doing to her I was left all
alone and at that moment    I became someone else do you understand Even
though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room nor Marina and
Lyuda under the bed could save me all the same I somehow managed to hold out
I went on fighting them I bit someone I remember and I scratched another 
But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were the ones 
I had observed the ones who beat Karina what kind of people they were the 
ones who beat me that it was all unnecessary that I was about to die and 
that all of that would die with me

At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building I 
didn't know his name but we would greet one another when we met we knew that
we were from the same microdistrict When I saw him I said Neighbor is that
you In so doing I placed myself in great danger He realized that if I lived
I would remember him That's when he grabbed the axe The axe that had been 
taken from my father I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to 
take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have been better if he
had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery When he 
started getting ready to wind back for the blow someone came into the room 
The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in 
the air Everyone stood at attention for this guy like soldiers in the 
presence of a general Everyone waited for his word continue the atrocities 
or not He said Enough let's go to the third entryway In the third 
entryway they killed Uncle Shurik Aleksandr Gambarian This confirms once 
again that they had prepared in advance Almost all of them left with him as 
they went picking up pillows blankets whatever they needed whatever they 
found all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot someone else had 
already taken the other

Four people remained in the room soldiers who didn't obey their general They
had to have come recently because other faces had flashed in front of me over
those  to  hours but I had never seen those three One of them Kuliyev I 
identified him later a native of the Sisian District of Armenia an 
Azerbaijani had moved to Azerbaijan a year before He told me in Armenian
Sister don't be afraid I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here
That's just what he said those Azerbaijanis as though he himself were not 
Azerbaijani but some other nationality he said with such hatred I'll drive
them out of here now and you put your clothes on and find a hammer and nails
and nail the door shut because they'll be coming back from Apartment  
That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment  Before that the 
person in the Eskimo dogskin coat the one who came in and whom they listened 
to the general said that they were going to the third entryway

Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on because l couldn't do it by myself 
Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor He threw it over my shoulders I
was racked with shivers and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer 
He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut 
But the door was lying on the floor in the hall

I went out onto the balcony There were broken windows and flowers and dirt 
from flowerpots were scattered on the floor It was impossible to find 
anything He told me Well fine I won't leave you here Would any of the 
neighbors let you in They'll be back they won't calm down they know you're 
alive He told me all this in Armenian

Then he returned to the others and said What are you waiting for Leave 
They said Ah you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her 
yourself No we want to do it to He urged them on but gently not 
coarsely because he was alone against them although they were still just
boys not old enough to be drafted He led them out of the room and went
down to the third floor with them himself and said Leave What's the mat
ter aren't you men Go fight with the men What do you want of her And
he came back upstairs They wanted to come up after him and he realized that 
he couldn't hold them off forever Then he asked me where he could hide me I 
told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor Apartment  we were on really
good terms with them

We knocked on the door and he explained in Azerbaijani The neighbor woman 
opened the door and immediately said I'm an Azerbaijani He said I know 
Let her sit at your place a while Don't open the door to anyone no one knows
about this I won't tell anyone Let her stay at your place She says Fine
have her come in I went in She cried a bit and gave me some stockings I 
had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders I burst into 
tears Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat it's a short one a 
halflength I was cold all the same I asked Do you know where my family 
is what happened to them She says No I don't know anything I'm afraid 
to go out of the apartment now they're so wild that they don't look to see 
who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian Kuliyev left Ten minutes later my 
neighbor says You know Lyuda I don't want to lose my life because of you 
or my son and his wife Go stay with someone else During the butchery in our
apartment one of the scum a sadist took my earring in his mouthI had pearl
earrings onand ripped it out tearing the earlobe The other earring was 
still there When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly and then when I 
touched my ear I noticed that I had one earring on I took it out and gave it
to her She took the earring but she led me out of the apartment

I went out and didn't know where to go I heard someone going upstairs I 
don't know who it was but assumed it was them With tremendous difficulty I 
end up to our apartment I wanted to die in my own home I go into the 
apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place to the fifth floor 
I had to do something I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had 
hidden and saw that the bed was overturned Instead of hiding I squatted near 
some broken Christmas ornaments found an unbroken one and started sobbing 
Then they came in Someone said that there were still some things to take I 
think that someone pushed me under the bed I lay on the floor and there were
broken ornaments on it under my head and legs I got all cut up but I lay 
there without moving My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town 
could hear it There were no lights on Maybe that's what saved me They were 
burning matches and toward the end they brought in a candle They started
picking out the clothes that could still be worn They took Father's sport 
jacket and a bedspread the end of which was under my head They pulled on the
one end and it felt like they were pulling my hair out I almost cried out 
And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive and I started to 
strangle myself again I took my throat in one hand and pressed the other on 
my mouth so as not to wheeze so that I would die and they would only find me
afterward They were throwing the burned matches under the bed and I got 
burned but I withstood it Something inside of me held on someone's hand was
protecting me to the end I knew that I was going to die but I didn't know 
how I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment but if 
I found out that one of my family had died I would die for sure because I 
had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on 
living without your mother or father or without your sister Marina I 
thought was still alive she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her 
I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed He served in 
Afghanistan he should protect her

While I was strangling myself I said my goodbyes to everyone And then I
thought how could Marina survive alone If they killed all of us how would 
she live all by herself There were six people in the room They talked among 
themselves and smoked One talked about his daughter saying that there was no
children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter 
Another said that he liked the apartmentrecently we had done a really good 
job fixing everything upand that he would live there after everything was 
all over They started to argue A third one says How come you get it I 
have four children and there are three rooms here that's just what I need 
All these years I've been living in Godawful places Another one says 
Neither of you gets it We'll set fire to it and leave Then someone said 
that Azerbaijanis live right next door the fire could move over to their
place And they to my good fortune didn't set fire to the apartment and
left

Oh yes I just remembered While they were raping me they repeated quite 
frequently Let the Armenian women have babies for us Muslim babies let 
them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians Then they 
said Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause Heroes They repeated it 
very often

continued from PART A

The six of them left They left and I had an attack I realized that the dan
ger was past and stopped controlling myself I relaxed for a moment and the 
physical pain immediately made itself felt My heart and kidneys hurt I had 
an awful kidney attack I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas
ornaments howling and howling I didn't know where I was or how long this 
went on When we figured out the time later it turned out that I howled and 
was in pain for around an hour Then all my strength was gone and I burst into
tears I started feeling sorry for myself and so on and so forth   

Then someone came into the room I think I hear someone calling my name I 
want to respond and restrain myself I think that I'm hallucinating I am 
silent and then it continues it seems that first a man's voice is calling
me then a woman's Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor the
one whose apartment she was hiding in Uncle Sabir Kasumov to our place 
telling him I know that they've killed Lyuda Go there and at least bring 
her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse He went and returned empty
handed but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his 
apartment She sent him another time and then sent his wife and they were 
walking through the rooms looking for me but I didn't answer their calls 
There was no light they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps

They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock and at  I 
went down to the Kasumovs' I went down the stairs myself I walked out of the
apartment how long can you wait for your own death how long can you be 
cowardly afraid Come what will I walked out and started knocking on the 
doors one after the next No one not on the fifth floor not on the fourth 
opened the door On the third floor on the landing of the stairway Uncle 
Sabir's son started to shout Aunt Roza don't cry Lyuda's alive He 
knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya Igor and after them Mamma 
Aunt Tanya Uncle Sabir's wife is an Urdmurt All of us were in their 
apartment I didn't see Karina but she was in their home too Lying
delirious she had a fever Marina was there too and my father and mother
All of my family had gathered there
   
At the door I lost consciousness Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the
apartment

Later I found out what they had done to our Karina Mamma said Lyuda 
Karina's in really serious condition she's probably dying If she recognizes 
you don't cry don't tell her that her face looks so awful It was as though
her whole face was paralyzed you know everything was pushed over to one 
side her eye was all swollen and everything flowed together her lips her 
cheeks    It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole
microdistrict that's how disfigured her face was I said Fine Mamma was 
afraid to go into the room because she went in and hugged Karina and started 
to cry I went in As soon as I saw her my legs gave way I fell down near the
bed hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying She opened the eye 
that was intact looked at me and said Who is it But I could barely talk 
my whole face was so badly beaten I didn't say but rather muttered something
tender something incomprehensible but tender My Karochka my Karina my 
little golden one     She understood me

Then Igor brought me some water I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips 
She started to groan She was saying something to me but I couldn't 
understand it Then I made out It hurts I hurt all over Her hair was 
glued down with blood I stroked her forehead her head she had grit on her 
forehead and on her lips    She was groaning again and I don't know how 
to help her She calls me over with her hand come closer I go to her She's
saying something to me but I can't understand her Igor brings her a pencil 
and paper and says Write it down She shakes her head as if to say no I 
can't write I can't understand what she's saying She wanted to tell me 
something but she couldn't I say Karina just lie there a little while
then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then And then she says
Maybe it'll be too late And I completely    just broke down I couldn't
control myself

Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye I dipped
a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips She 
says Lyuda we're not saved yet we have to go somewhere else Out of this 
damned house They want to kill us I know They'll find us here too We need
to call Urshan She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour Until I 
understood her every word I ask What's his number Urshan Feyruzovich 
that's the head of the administration where she works We have to call him 
But I didn't know his home number I say Karina what's his number She 
says I can't remember I say Who knows his number Who can I call She 
says I don't know anything leave me alone

I went out of the room Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there he was 
crying too I say Mamma Karina says that we have to call Urshan How can 
we call him Who knows his telephone number I tell Marina Think think 
who can we call to find out She started calling several people didn't 
answer She called a girlfriend her girlfriend called another girlfriend and 
found out the number and called us back The boss's wife answered and said he 
was at the dacha My voice keeps cracking I can't talk normally She says 
Lyuda don't panic get a hold of yourself go out to those hooligans and 
tell them that they just can't do that She still didn't know what was really
going on I said It's easy for you to say that you don't understand what's 
happening They are killing people here I don't think there is a single 
Armenian left in the building they've cut them all up I'm even surprised 
that we managed to save ourselves She says Well OK if it's that serious 
    And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up 
and that I'm fearing for my life that in fact it's not all that bad OK 
fine fine she says if you're afraid OK as soon as Urshan comes back 
I'll send him over

We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly 
under Aunt Tanya's on the second floor Asya Dallakian's apartment She 
wasn't home she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh They destroyed 
everything there    We realized that they still might come back We kept on
trying to get through to Aunt TanyaUrshan's wife is named Tanya too and 
finally we get through She says Yes he's come home he's leaving for your 
place now He came Of course he didn't know what was happening either 
because he brought two of his daughters with him He came over in his jeep 
with his two daughters like he was going on an outing He came and saw what 
shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened He has 
grown up daughters they're almost my age

The three of us carried out Karina tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf and
went down to his car He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home   No 
first they took us to the poice precinct They had stretchers ready As
soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said
that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move we might have
fractures From the stretcher I saw about  soldiers sitting and lying on the
first floor bandaged on the concrete floor groaning    This was around
eleven o'clock at night We had left the house somewhere around  When I 
saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on soldiers enemies
   everything just like a war

They carried me into some office on the stretcher The emergency medical
people from Baku were there The medical attendant there was an older 
Armenian Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud 
she would never have told And this aging Armenian    his name was Uncle 
Arkady I think because someone said Arkady get an injection ready he 
started to fill a syringe and turned around so as to give Karina a shot But 
when he looked at her face he became ill And he was an old man in his 
sixties his hair was all grey and his moustache too He hugged Karina and 
started to cry What have they done to you He was speaking Armenian What
have they done to you Karina didn't say anything Mamma came in then and 
she started to cry too The man tried to calm her I'll give you a shot 
Mamma tells him I don't need any shot Where is the government Just what 
are they doing Look what they've done to my children They're killing people
and you're just sitting here Some teacups were standing on the table in 
there You're sitting here drinking tea Look what they've done to my 
daughters Look what they've turned them into They gave her something to 
drink some heart medicine I think They gave Karina an injection and the
doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately Papa 
and Urshan I think even though Papa was in bad shape helped carry Karina 
out When they put her on the stretcher none of the medics got near her I 
don't know maybe there weren't any orderlies Then they came to me What's 
the matter with you Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter
in the halflength coat I had a blanket on too an orange one Aunt Tanya's
I said I'm fine Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me and then told 
the doctor You leave let a woman examine her A woman came an 
Azerbaijani I believe and said What's wrong with you I was wearing my 
sister Lyuda's nightshirt the sister who at this time was in Yerevan When 
she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would 
be easier to breast feed the baby I tore the night shirt some more and showed
her I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her There was a huge 
wound about the size of a hand on my back from the Indian vase She said 
something to them and they gave me two shots She said that it should be 
dressed with something but that they'd do that in the hospital

They put me on a stretcher too They started looking for people to carry me 
I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up and this woman I don't 
know if she was a doctor or a nurse said Lie still you mustn't move When
I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man His profile seemed 
very familiar to me I shouted Stop One of the policemen turned and says 
What do you want I say Bring him to me I want to look at him They 
brought him over and I said That person was just in our apartment and he 
just raped me and my sister I recognize him note it down They said 
Fine but didn't write it down and led him on I don't know where they were 
taking him

Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were 
sitting They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car 
up closer One of the soldiers started talking to me Sister     I don't 
remember the conversation exactly but he asked me were we lived and what they
did to us I asked him Where are you from He said that he was from Ufa 
Apparently they were the first that were brought in The Ufa police Later I 
learned that they suffered most of all He says OK you're Armenians they 
didn't get along with you but I'm a Russian he says what are they trying 
to kill me for Oh I remembered something else When I went out onto the 
balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw 
two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten He was pressed 
against the fence and he covered his head with his arms they were beating him
with his own club The way he cried Mamma made my skin crawl I don't know 
what they did to him if he's still alive or not And something else Before 
he attack on our house we saw sheets clothes and some dishes flying from the
third or fourth floor of the neighboring building but I didn't think it was 
Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians I thought that something was on fire or they
were throwing something they didn't need out or someone was fighting with 
someone It was only later when they were burning a passenger car in the 
yard when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians that
I realized that this was serious that it was antiArmenian

They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home Mamma went to them too 
and said I've been beaten too help me But they just ignored her My 
father went to them and said in a guilty voice as though it was his fault 
that he'd been beaten and says My ribs hurt so much those creeps have 
probably broken my ribs Please look at them The doctor says That's not my
job Urshan said Fine I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor 
I'll find you one I'll bring one and have him look at you And he drove them 
to his apartment

Marina and I stayed there They examined us I was more struck by what the 
doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us I 
wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us but I was very
surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the
Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that By happyor unhappy
coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina And she
having examined Karina said No problem you got off pretty good Not like 
they did in Kafan when you Armenians were killing and raping our women
Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anythingshe
would certainly have had something to say Then they examined me The same 
story They put us in a separate ward No shots no medicinal powders no 
drugs Absolutely none They didn't even give us tea All the women there soon
found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped And
they started coming and peering through the keyhole the way people look at 
zoo animals Karina didn't see this she was lying there and I kept her from 
seeing it

They put Ira B in our ward She had also been raped True she didn't have 
any serious bodily injuries but when she told me what had happened at their 
place I felt worse for them than I did for us Because when they raped Ira 
her daughter was in the room she was under the bed on which it happened And
Ira was holding her daughter's hand the one who was hiding under the bed
When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off gold when she 
involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand her daughter took her hand again
Her daughter is in the fourth grade she's  years old I felt really awful 
when I heard that Ira asked them not to harm her daughter she said Do what
you want with me just leave my daughter alone Well they did what they 
wanted They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way Now I 
would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night It 
was simply Bartholomew's Night I say they did what they would love to do 
every day steal kill rape   

Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children The beasts 
explained it like this this would be repeated in  to  years and those 
children would be grown and then as they put it we'll come take the 
pleasure out of their lives those children This was about the girls that
would be young women in  years They were thinking about their tomorrow 
because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation just
as there was no trial or investigation in  and that those girls could be 
of some use in  years This I heard from the investigators one of the 
victims testified to it That's how they described their own natures that
they would still be bloodthirsty in  to  years and in  yearsthey
themselves said that

And this too Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina Many 
people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much I don't know 
why their eyes were red Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before 
maybe for some other reason I don't know But they hadn't been smoking and 
they weren't drunk I'm positive because someone who has smoked will stop at 
nothing he has the urge to do And they spoke in a cultured fashion with 
Marina Little sister don't be afraid we won't harm you don't look over 
there where I was you might be frightened You're a Muslim a Muslim woman 
shouldn't see such things So they were really quite sober   

So we came out of that story alive Each every day we have lived since it all 
happened bears the mark of that day It wasn't even a day of those several 
hours Father still can't look us in the eyes He still feels guilty for what
happened to Karina Mother and me Because of his nerves he's started talk
ing to himself I've heard him argue with himself several times when he
thought no one is listening Listen he'll say what could I do What could
I do alone how could I protect them I don't know where to find the words
it's not that I'm happy but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen 
That's the only thing they spared us    or maybe it happened by chance Of 
course he knows it all but there's no way you could imagine every last detail
of what happened And there were so many conversations Karina and I spoke
together in private and we talked with Mamma too But Father was never
present at those conversations We spare him that if you can say that And
when the investigator comes to the house we don't speak with Father present

On February  the next clay Karina and I were discharged from the hospital
First they released me but since martial law had been declared in the city 
the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier 
There were many people there Armenian victims I met the Tovmasian family 
there From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died They 
were sure that both had died They were talking to me and Raya Rafik's wife 
and Grant's daughter and her mother were both crying

Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard
There's a little oneroom house outside there a recreation and reading area
They took us in there The women were afraid to go because they thought
that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become
so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide
The women were shouting They explained to them We want to hide you
better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct

We went into the little house There were no chairs or tables in there We
had children with us and they were hungry we even had infants who needed to 
have their diapers changed No one had anything with them It was just awful 
They kept us there for  hours From the window of the one room house you 
could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the 
police precinct as though they were spying on us The police precinct is 
surrounded by a wall like a fence and it's electrified but if they were 
standing on the wall it means the electricity was shut off This brought 
great psychological pressure to bear on us particularly on those who hadn't 
just walked out of their apartments but who hadn't slept for  hours or 
or those who had suffered physically and spiritually the ones who had lost 
family members For us it was another ordeal We were especially frightened 
when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared We couldn't see a single
person not in the courtyard and not in the windows We thought that they must
have already been hiding under the building that they must have some secret 
room down there People were panicking they started throwing themselves at
one another    That's the way it is on a sinking ship We heard those 
people mainly young people whistling and whopping on the walls We felt that
the end was approaching I was completely terrified I had left Karina in the 
hospital and didn't know where my parents were I was sort of calm about my 
parents I was thinking only about Karina if Heaven forbid they should 
attack the hospital they would immediately tell them that there was an 
Armenian in there and something terrible would happen to Karina again and 
she wouldn't be able to take it

Then soldiers with dogs appeared When they saw the dogs some of the people 
climbed down off the fence Then they brought in about another  soldiers
They all had machine guns in readiness their fingers on the triggers We 
calmed down a little They brought us chairs and brought the children some 
little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands and took the children
to the toilet But we all sat there hungry but to be honest it would never 
have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people 
do eat

Then closer to nightfall they brought a group of detained criminals They 
were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs One of the men came back from 
the courtyard and told us about it Raya Tovmasian    it was like a 
different woman had been substituted Earlier she had been crying wailing 
and calling out Oh Rafik but when she heard about this such a rage came 
over her She jumped up she had a coat on and she started to roll up her 
sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone And suddenly there were 
soldiers and dogs and lots of people She ran over to them The bandits were
standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall She went up
to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash 
him Then on to a second and a third Everyone was rooted to the spot Not 
one of the soldiers moved no one went up to help or made her stop her from 
doing it And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands 
muttering something She came back and sat down and something akin to a smile
appeared on her face She became so quiet no tears no cries Then that round
was over and she went back to beat them again She was walking and cursing 
terribly take that and that they killed my husband the bastards the 
creeps and so on Then she came back again and sat down She probably did 
this the whole night through well it wasn't really night no one slept She 
went five or six times and beat them and returned And she told the women 
What are you sitting there for They killed your husbands and children they 
raped and you're just sitting there You're sitting and talking as though 
nothing had happened Aren't you Armenians She appealed to everyone but no 
one got up I was just numb I didn't have the strength to beat anyone I 
could barely hold myself up all the more so since I had been standing for so 
many hoursI was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already
after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs really it was the 
elderly and women with children who sat I was on my feet the whole time 
There was nothing to breathe the door was closed and the men were smoking 
The situation was deplorable

At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us local policemen 
Azerbaijanis They said Get up They've brought mattresses you can wash up
and put the children to bed Now the women didn't want to leave this place 
either The place had become like home it was safe there were soldiers with 
dogs If anyone went outside the soldiers would say Oh it's our little 
family and things like that The soldiers felt this love and probably for 
the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders Everyone
spoke from the heart cried and hugged them and they with their loaded
machine guns in their hands said Grandmother you mustn't approach me
I'm on guard Our people would say Oh that's all right They hugged
them one woman even kissed one of the machine guns This was all terribly
moving for me And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs

They took us up to the second floor and said You can undress and sleep in 
here Don't be afraid the precinct is on guard and it's quiet in the city
This was the th when the killing was going on in block A and in other
places Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the
SK club and at the City Party Committee They took us there On the way I 
asked them to stop at the Maternity Home I wanted to take Karina with me
I didn't know what was happening there They told me Don't worry the
Maternity Home is full of soldiers more than motherstobe So you can rest
assured I say Well I won't rest assured regardless because the staff in
there is capable of anything

When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had
already been brought there They had seen fit to release her from the hospi
tal deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care Once
we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears We met 
acquaintances but everyone was somehow divided into two groups those who 
hadn't been injured who were clothed who had brought a pot of food with 
them and so on and those like me like Raya who were wearing whatever had 
come their way There were even people who were all made up dolled up like 
they had come from a wedding There were people without shoes naked people 
hungry people those who were crying and those who had lost someone And of 
course the stories and the talk were flying Oh I heard that they killed 
him What do you mean they killed him He stayed at work Do you know 
what's happening at this and such a plant Talk like that

And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian the teacher I know him very 
well and respect him highly I've known him for a long time They had a small 
room well really it was more like a studyroom We spent a whole night 
talking in that study once On March  we heard that Bagirov First Secretary 
of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR had arrived Everyone ran to see 
Bagirov what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed 
from outside He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask 
him things Everyone was in a tremendous rage But he was protected by 
soldiers and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with 
the people Apparently he had more important things to do

Several hours passed Gukasian called me and says Lyudochka find another 
two or three We're going to make up lists they asked for them upstairs 
lists of the dead those whose whereabouts are unknown and lists of people 
who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned I 
had about  people in my list when they called me and said Lyuda your 
Mamma has arrived she's looking for you she doesn't believe that you are 
alive and well and that you're here I gave the lists to someone and asked 
them to continue what I was doing and went off

The list was imprecise of course It included Grant Adamian Raya Tovmasian's
father who was alive but at the time they thought him dead There was Engels
Grigorian's father and aunt Cherkez and Maria The list also included the 
name of my girlfriend and neighbor Zhanna Agabekian One of the guys said 
that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front
of the Kosmos movie theater We put her on the list too and cried but later 
it turned out that that was just a rumor that in fact an hour earlier she had
somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for 
Krasnovodsk where thank God she was alive and well I should also say that 
in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored 
missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead                                                                 

All the lists were taken to Bagirov I don't remember how many dead were 
contained in the list but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple 
of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate I asked What's 
going on He said Lyuda can you imagine what animals what scoundrels
they are They say that they lost the list of the dead Piotr Demichev
Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of the USSR has just arrived and we were supposed to submit the list to
him so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter of the tragedy whether it
was one or fifty They told him that the list had disappeared and they
should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over
again There were  people on our second list I think that the number 
was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio because
that's the list that Demichev got I remember exactly that there were  
people on the list I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only 
a half of those that were on the first list He said Lyuda please try to
remember at least one more But I couldn't remember anyone else But there
were more than  dead Of that I am certain The government and the Procuracy
don't count the people who died of fright like sick people and old people 
whose lives are threatened by any shock They weren't registered as victims of
the Sumgait tragedy And then there may be people we didn't know So many 
people left Sumgait between March  and  Most of them left for smaller towns
in Russia and especially to the Northern Caucasus to Stavropol and the 
Krasnodarsk Territory We don't have any information on them I know that 
there are people who set out for parts around Moscow In the periodical 
Krestyanka Woman Farmer there was a call for people who know how to milk 
cows and for mechanics and drivers and I know a whole group of people went 
to help out Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering
the city who were burned in their cars No one knows about them except the 
Azerbaijanis who are hardly likely to say anything about it And there's
more A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list 
drawn up at the Procuracy I know of three instances for sure and I of course
don't know them all I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to 
publicize what had happened that is they didn't take the matter to court 
they simply left But in so doing they didn't cease being victims One of them
is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian She lived in Microdistrict No 
 on the fifth floor I can't tell you the building number and I don't know 
her name Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives she lived in 
Microdistrict  near the gift shop I don't know her name she lives on the 
same landing as the Sumgait procurator They beat her father he was holding 
the door while his daughter hid but he couldn't hold the door forever and 
when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her 
braid Like the Azerbaijanis were saying it was a very cultured mob because 
they didn't kill anyone they only raped them and left And the third one 
   I don't remember who the third one was anymore

They transferred us on March  Karina still wasn't herself Yes we lived for
days in the SK in the cultural facility and at the Khimik They lived there 
and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina 
it was too difficult for me but I was at peace she had survived I could 
already walk but really it was honest words that held me up Thanks to the 
social work I did there I managed to persevere Aleksandr Mikhailovich said 
If it weren't for the work I would go insane He and I put ourselves in gear
and took everything upon ourselves someone had an infant and needed diapers 
and free food and we went to get them The first days we bought everything 
although we should have received it for free They were supposed to have been 
dispensed free of charge and they sold it to us Then when we found out it 
was free we went to Krayev At the time fortunately you could still drop by
to see him like a neighbor all the more so since everything was still clearly
visible on our faces Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue

On March  they sent two investigators to see us Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir
Fedorovich Bibishev The way it worked out in our family they had considered 
only Karina and me victims maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital
Mother and Father are considered witnesses but not victims

Shirokov was involved with Karina's case and Bibishev with mine After I 
told him everything he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and
record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind 
We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the
conditions weren't there The investigative group worked slowly and did poor 
quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working there 
weren't enough automobiles especially during the time when there was a 
curfew and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts and no still or 
video cameras I think that this was done on purpose We're not so poor that 
we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff It was done especially 
to draw out the investigation all the more so since the local authorities saw
that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light never to return to 
Sumgait And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with 
Bibishev I told him myself Don't you worry if it takes us a month or two 
months I'll be here I'm not afraid I looked death in the eyes five times in
those two days I'll help you conduct the investigation

He and I worked together a great deal and I used this to shelter Karina I
gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to
her so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her
self She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x
rays She couldn't eat or drink for nine days she was nauseous I didn't eat
and drank virtually nothing for five days Then on the fifth day when we
were in Baku already the investigator told me How long can you go on like 
this Well fine so you don't want to eat you don't love yourself you're
not taking care of yourself but you gave your word that you would see this
investigation through We need you Then I started eating because in fact I
was exhausted It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart
ment in my mind every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement
cells and prisons I don't know    we were just everywhere Probably in
every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of
Sumgait At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary 
confinement

Thus far I have identified  of the people who were in our apartment Mamma 
identified three and Karina two The total is  Marina didn't identify 
anyone she remembers the faces of two or three But they weren't among the 
photographs of those detained I told of the neighbor I recognized The one 
who went after the axe He still hasn't been detained he's still on the 
loose He's gone and it's not clear if he will be found or not I don't know 
his first or last name I know which building he lived in and I know his 
sisters' faces But he's not in the city The investigators informed me that 
even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will 
continue looking for him

The  people I identified are largely bluecollar workers from various 
plants without education and of the very lowest level in every respect
Mostly their ages range from  to  years there was one who was  Only
one of them was a student He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and
Chemical Institute in Sumgait his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga
tor Once thinking that I was an employee and not a victim she said in front
of me I'll set you up a restaurant worth  rubles and give you  in cash
simply for keeping him out of Armenia that is to keep him from landing in
a prison on Armenian soil They're all terribly afraid of that because if the
investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even
though we identified him they tell himin order to apply psychological
pressurethey say Fine don't confess just keep silent When you're in an
Armenian prison when they find out who you are they'll take care of you
in short order That somehow gets to them Many give in and start to talk

The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire
pogrom of our apartment as an investigative experiment It was only then
that I saw the way they had left our apartment Even without knowing who was 
in our apartment you could guess They stole for example all the money and 
all the valuables but didn't take a single book They tore them up burned 
them poured water on them and hacked them with axes Only the Materials
from the th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James 
Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans Oh yes lunch was ready we were 
boiling a chicken and there were lemons for tea on the table After they had 
been in our apartment both the chicken and the lemons were gone That's 
enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment people who don't
even know anything about books They didn't take a single book but they did 
take worn clothing food and even the cheapest of the cheap wornout 
slippers

Of those whom I identified four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait 
Basically the group that went seeking revengelet's use their word for 
itwas joined by people seeking easy gain and thrillseekers I talked with 
one of them He had gray eyes and somehow against the backdrop of all that 
black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes Besides taking
part in the pogrom of our apartment he was also involved in the murder of 
Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building  She was an older Armenian who had recently
arrived from Georgia she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait I 
don't know why she had a last name like that maybe she was married to an 
Azerbaijani I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice and know 
nothing about her I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an 
axe Murdering her wasn't enough for them They hacked her into pieces and 
threw them into the tub with water

I remember another guy really well too he was also rather fairskinned You 
know all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark both 
their hair and their skin And in contrast with them in addition to the grey
eyed one I remember this one fellow the one l took to be a Lezgin I 
identified him As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian born
in the city of Sumgait and he had been convicted twice One of our own How 
did I remember him The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand I 
kept thinking is that Rita or puma which it would be if you read the word 
as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic because the Cyrillic T was the one 
that looks like a Latin M When they led him in he sat with his hands behind
his back This was at the confrontation He swore on every holy book tried to
put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion and 
told me that I was making a mistake and called me dear sister He said 
You're wrong how could I an Armenian raise my hand against my own an 
Armenian and so on He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator 
asked me Lyuda are you sure it was he I told him I'll tell you one more
identifying mark If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken The 
name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand He went rigid and became 
pale They told him Put your hands on the table He put his hands on the
table with the palms up I said Now turn your hands over but he didn't 
turn his hands over Now this infuriated me If he had from the very start
acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it that they 
forced him or something else I would have treated him somewhat differently
But he insolently stuck to his story No I did not do anything it wasn't 
me When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his
hand His face distorted and he whispered something wicked I immediately flew
into a rage There was an ashtray on the table a really heavy one made out 
of granite or something very large and it had ashes and butts in it 
Catching myself quite by surprise I hurled that ashtray at him But he ducked
and the ashtray hit the wall and ashes and butts rained down on his head and 
back And he smiled When he smiled it provoked me further I don't know how 
but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or 
strangling him I no longer remember which When I jumped I caught the 
microphone cord The investigator was there Tolya   I no longer recall his
last name and he says Lyudochka it's a Japanese microphone Please   
 And shut off all the equipment on the spot it was all being video taped 
They took him away I stayed and they talked to me a little to calm me down 
because we needed to go on working I only remember Tolya telling me You're 
some actress What a performance I said Tolya honestly     Beforehand
they would always tell me Lyuda more emotion You speak as calmly as if 
nothing had happened to you I say I don't have any more strength or 
emotion All my emotions are behind me now I no longer have the strength 
   I don't have the strength to do anything And he says Lyuda how were
you able to do that And when I returned to normal drinking tea and watching
the tape I said Can I really have jumped over that table I never jumped 
that high in gym class

So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international Of 
the  we identified there was an Armenian a Russian Vadim Vorobyev who 
beat Mamma and  Azerbaijanis

At the second meeting with Grigorian when he had completely confessed his 
guilt he told of how on February  the Azerbaijanis had come knocking Among
them were guysif you can call them guyshe knew from prison They said 
Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians Meet us at the bus station at three
o'clock He said No I'm not coming They told him If you don't come 
we'll kill you He said Alright I'll come And he went

They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict Kamo Pogosian He
had also been in prison I think that together they had either stolen a 
motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed They called him 
out of his apartment and told him the same thing Tomorrow we're going to get
the Armenians Be there He said No They pulled a knife on him He said 
I'm not going all the same And in the courtyard on the th they stabbed 
him several times in the stomach He was taken to the hospital I know he was
in the hospital in Baku in the Republic hospital If we had known about that 
we would have had some idea of what was to come on the th

I'll return to Grigorian what he did in our apartment I remember that he
beat me along with all the rest He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well But he
was very fairskinned maybe that led me to think that they had it out for
him too But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning
of Shagen Sargisian I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our 
apartment I didn't see I don't remember But the people who were in our 
apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did I 
don't know if he confessed or not and I myself don't recall because I blacked
out very often But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina
because he was in the apartment the whole time When they carried her into the
courtyard he remained in the apartment

At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian From her
I learned that his wife was a dressmaker his mother is Russian he doesn't 
have a father and that he's been convicted twice Well this will be his third
and I hope last sentence He beat his wife she was eternally coming to work
with bruises His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita

The others who were detained    well they're little beasts You really can't
call them beasts they're just little beasts They were robots carrying out
someone else's will because at the investigation they all said I don't 
understand how I could have done that I was out of my head But we know that
they were won around to it and prepared for it that's why they did it In the
name of Allah in the name of the Koran in the name of propagating Islam
that's holy to themthat's why they did everything they were commanded to do
Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own I'm not talking about their
level of cultural sophistication or any higher values No education they
work have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly they 
crowd them in like at the temporary housing and apparently they were 
promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments
So off they went Many of them explained their participation saying they 
promised us apartments

Among them was one who genuinely repented I am sure that he repented from the
heart and that he just despised himself after the incident He worked at a 
children's home an Azerbaijani he has two children and his wife works at 
the children's home too Everything that they acquired everything that they 
have they earned by their own labor and wasn't inherited from parents or 
grandparents And he said I didn't need anything I just don't know    how
I ended up in that it was like some hand was guiding me I had no will of my 
own I had no strength no masculine dignity nothing And the whole time I
kept repeating Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife 
right before your own eyes He sat there and just wailed

But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained He performed a 
marvelous disappearing act but I think that they'll get onto him they just 
have to work a little because that Vadim that boy according to his
grandfather is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do how 
to cover his tracks He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he 
knew and those he didn't either and other things as well and changed 
himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him but he was detained

That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr 
Gambarian was murdered He came in and said Let's go enough you've spilled
enough blood here

Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was 
that they were hoping to take her home with them I heard this from Aunt Tanya
and her sons the Kasumovs who were in the courtyard near the entryway They 
liked her very much and they had decided to take her to home with them When 
Karina came to at one pointshe doesn't remember this yet this the neighbors 
old meand she saw that there was no one around her she started crawling to 
the entryway They saw that she was still alive and came back they were 
already at the third entryway on their way to the Gambarians' They came back
and started beating her to finish her If she had not come to she would have 
sustained lesser bodily injuries they would have beat her less An older 
woman from our building Aunt Nazan an Azerbaijani all but lay on top of 
Karina crying and pleading that they leave her alone but they flung her off
The woman's grown sons were right nearby they picked her up in their hands 
and led her home She howled and cried out loudly and swore God is on Earth 
he sees everything and He won't forgive this

There was another woman too Aunt Fatima a sick aging woman from the first 
floor she's already retired Mountain dwellers and Azerbaijanis too have a
custom If men are fighting they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them
But they trampled her scarf and sent her home To trample a scarf is 
tantamount to trampling a woman's honor

Now that the investigation is going on now that a lot is behind us and we 
have gotten back to being ourselves a little I think about how could these 
events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen How did they come 
about How did it start Could it have been avoided Well it's clear that 
without a signal without permission from the top leadership it would not 
have happened All the same I'm not afraid to say this the Azerbaijanis
let other worthy people take no offense the better representatives of their 
nations let them take no offense but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are 
a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law fear of retribution for
what they have done And when the law said that they could do all that like
unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything they 
threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done
to snatch a bit more The smell of the danger was already in the air on
February  You could tell that something was going to happen And everyone 
who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs Many left
for their dachas got plane tickets for the other end of the country just got
as far away as their legs would carry them

February  was a Saturday I was teaching my third class The director came 
into my classroom and said that I should let the children out that there had 
been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for 
a meeting at Lenin Square Well I excused the children and there were few 
teachers left at school altogether three women the director and six or 
seven men The rest had already gone home We got to Lenin Square and there 
were a great many people there This was around fivethirty or six in the 
evening no later They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and 
the crowd below was supporting them stormily roaring They spoke over the 
microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the 
driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani
child off the bus The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness that he had
seen it himselfThe crowd started to rage Death to the Armenians They must
be killed Then a woman went up on stage I didn't see the woman because 
people were clinging to the podium like flies I could only hear her The 
woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan and said that the Armenians 
cut her daughters' breasts off and called Sons avenge my daughters That 
was enough A portion of the people on the square took off running in the 
direction of the factories toward the beginning of Lenin Street

We stood there about an hour Then the director of School  spoke he gave a 
very nationalist speech He said Brother Muslims kill the Armenians This 
he repeated every other sentence When he said this the crowd supported him 
stormily whistling and shouting Karabagh He said Karabagh has been our 
territory my whole life long Karabagh is my soul How can you tear out my 
heart As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh It's our 
territory the Armenians will never see it The Armenians must be eliminated 
From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians from
time immemorial that's the way nature created it that every  to  years 
the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth By filth he meant 
Armenians

I heard this Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely
Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium talking shop with 
the other teachers and somehow it all went right by it didn't penetrate
that in fact something serious was taking place Then when one of our
teachers said Listen to what he's saying listen to what idiocy he's 
spouting we listened That was the speech of that director Before that we 
listened to the woman's speech

Right then in our groupthere were nine of usthe mood changed and the 
subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten Our director of
studies for whom I had great respect he's an Azerbaijani    Before that I
had considered him an upstanding and worthy person if there was a need to 
obtain leave we had asked him he seemed like a good person So he tells me
Lyuda you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square If 
they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces Should I 
tell them you're an Armenian Should I tell them you're an Armenian When he 
said it the first time I pretended not to hear it and then he asked me a 
second time I turned to the director Khudurova and said that it was already
after eight I was expected at home and I should be leaving She answered 
No they said that women should stay here until ten o'clockand men until 
twelve Stay here There was a young teacher with us her children were in 
kindergarten and her husband worked shifts She asked to leave I left my 
children at the kindergarten The director excused her When she let her go I
turned around said Goodbye and left with the young teacher the 
Azerbaijani I didn't see them after that

When we were walking the buses weren't running and a crowd from the rally ran
nearby us They had apparently gotten all fired up It must have become too 
much for them and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately so they rushed 
off I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher 
wouldn't say that I was an Armenian

To make it short we reached home Then Karina told of how they had been at 
the movies and what had happened there I started telling of my experience and
again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger We watched 
television as usual and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last 
day That's how it all was

At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance we went to school together
Zhanna I don't remember her last name she lives above the housewares store 
on Narimanov Street She was there with her father for some reason she 
doesn't have a mother The two of them were at home alone While her father 
held the door she jumped from the third floor and she was lucky that the 
ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went 
out on the balcony there was no one there they were all standing near the 
entryway That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders 
there She jumped She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the 
moment A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up she had been 
injured somehow That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives their honor 
and their children any way they could 

Where it was possible the Armenians fought back My father's first cousin 
Armen M lives in Block  They found out by phone from one of the victims 
what was going on in town The Armenians in that building all called one 
another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes knives even 
with muskets and went up to the roof They took their infants with them and 
their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months they got 
them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs They hooked 
electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited ready to fight Then 
they took the daughter of the school board director hostage she's an 
Azerbaijani who lived in their building They called the school board director
and told her that if she didn't help them the  Armenians on the roof to 
escape alive and unharmed she'd never see her daughter again I'm sure of 
course that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman it was just the only
thing that could have saved them at the time She called the police The 
Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town Two armored 
personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and
led everyone down from the roof and off to the side from the armored 
personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that 
very moment into Block  That's how they defended themselves

I heard that our neighbors Roman and Sasha Gambarian resisted They're big 
strong guys Their father was killed And I heard that the brothers put up a 
strong defense and lost their father but were able to save their mother

One of the neighbors told me that after it happened when they were looking 
for the criminals on March  to  and detaining everyone they suspected 
people hid people in our entryway maybe people who were injured or perhaps 
dead The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there and when they went 
with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found 
Azerbaijani corpses I don't know how many Even if they had been wounded and 
put down there after two days they would have died from loss of blood or 
infectionthat basement was filled with water I heard this from the 
neighbors And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject 
came up and they confirmed it I know too that for several hours the 
basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment And our neighbor
carried out our carpet along with the rest he stole it for himself posing 
as one of the criminals Everyone was taking his own share and the neighbor 
took his too and carried it home And when we came back when everything 
seemed to have calmed down he returned it saying that it was the only thing 
of ours he had managed to save

Raya's husband and father defended themselves The Trdatovs defended 
themselves and so did other Armenian families To be sure there were
Azerbaijani victims although we'll never hear anything about them For some 
reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just 
victims but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers too 
In the TV show Pozitsiya Viewpoint a military man an officer said that 
the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves But that's not 
important the truth will come out regardless

So that's the price we paid those three days For three days our courage our 
bravery and our humanity was tested It was those three days and not the 
years and dozens of years we had lived before them that showed what we've 
become what we grew up to be Those three days showed who was who

On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy It should be said
that it's not over yet the trials are still ahead of us and the punishments
received by those who so violated us who wanted to make us into nonhumans 
will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators the 
Procuracy and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga
tion That's the price we paid to live in Armenia to not fear going out on 
the street at night to not be afraid to say we're Armenians and to not fear
speaking our native tongue

Dear folks

I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal
civlized life They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 
without civil and political rights 

It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country Palestine Gaza is
not a foriegn country Nor is TelAviv Jaffa Askalon BeerSheba foreign
country for Gazans All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians
are concerned and as far as common sense has it 

It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens
and the right to determine by themsevles their government When Zionists
will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same
rights as themselves there will be hope for peace Not before

Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel
is entitled to close its borders to Gaza In this case Gaza should be
entitled to reciprocate and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel
to enter the area As the relation is not symmetrical but that of a master
and slave the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading

To close off  people in the Strip deny them means of subsistence
and means of defending themselves is a collective punishment and a
crime It is neither justifiable nor legal It just reflects the abyss 
to which Israeli society has degraded 

I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain
why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return
and live there  Would they be allowed to if they converted to Judaism 
Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their
religion or ethnic origin  Please give an honest answer

Eh  Could you please give me details about an event where a Neutral
Observer was killed by purpose by an Israeli soldier


There are many cases but I do not remeber names  The Isralis shot and killed
a UN observer in Gaza in the first half of Intifada

That doesn't answer my question  Can you give a proof that it is an official
policy of any Israeli government to kill neutral observers or UN personel
or others like them

I wasn't sure that your original statement was wrong and was prepared to
recieve proofs that you are right  since I don't follow the events closely
Your last response made me pretty damn sure that at least YOU can't give such
a proof  and you made your original statement without much ground to put it
on

I believe that most of the world has seen pictures of Israeli soldiers who
were breaking the cameras of the reporters kicking reporters out
confiscating
cassettes and showing reporters militery orders preventing them from going
to hot areas to pick pictures and make reports

Even if it's true and in this case I'd take it without asking you to prove it
it is still far from killing reporters  Also whenever that happened I'll bet
it happened as individual actions by certain soldiers and not as a policy of
the government  eg see the Hawara case where a colonel was sentenced for
giving orders to kick Arabs  as far as I remember

Not exactly the same but reminiscent of the assassination of Count
Bernadotte who was the UN negotiator during the  Israeli war of
independence  He was killed by the Israelis  Seems he was being too
successful in negotiating a ceasefire which would have worked
territorially against the nascent Israel compared to continued war

That operation was done by a small Jewish fraction BEFORE the state even
existed and as far as I remember was disaproved by most of the Jews

Saying that He was killed by the Israelis is plain wrong because there wasn't
Israel at the time

And as far as the Jews liked the idea of having part of the land you can see
their reaction to the UN resolution from  November  and the Arab's reaction
too  no  it wasn't that the Arabs danced in the streets with doznes of Jewish
states invading them but quite the other way around

What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in as far as I can get from the Arab
media
is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under
Koranic
Law This would be a reversal of the  situation in which the Jews in
Palestine took control of the land and its mostly Muslim inhabitants

The borders of the Jewish state as drawn by the UN included the areas which
contained mostly Jews  that's what the surveys and the numerous commitees
where after when they visited here

However whoever committed crimes against humanity torture blowing up their
homes murders must be treated and tried as a war criminal The political
thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the
Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice

I never touched an Arab during my army service and never voted for anyone more
right than the Green party  Will I be spared by these humanist standards
or will anyone stop to consider this before sloughtering me

I doubt it  And not only because of the past record of murdering helpless
women and children since the turn of the century up to these days

There is one big difference between Israel and the Arabs Christians in this
respect

Israel allows freedom of religion

   For your information Islam permits freedom of religion  there is
no compulsion in religion  Does Judaism permit freedom of religion
ie are nonJews recognized in Judaism  Just wondering

I really don't know how you can possibly maintain this hypocritical
stance

On the one hand you imply that there is a conspiracy of ArabAmericans
that warrants the illegal gathering of information on them ie auto license
registration information in California and other forms of monitoring including
blatant attempts by paid ADL agents to discredit an AmericanArab 
organization by trying to distribute Nazi propaganda  Furthermore
you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing 
to the WTC bombing in which ArabAmericans had no involvement

On the other hand you publish this excerpt which seems to rail
against notions of a racial Jewish in this case conspiracy and
stereotypes

If you really aren't the hypocrite you appear to be please explain 
yourself

	   Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
   during the 's and 's  The Hirgun and other branch 
   off militant groups did fight the British do get them out of
   Palestine  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
   terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
   Arabs  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
   soldiers but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
   favor of a compromise with the Palestinians

The Irgun killed SOLDIERS  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted
fogriend regime from a country  They didn't kill blindly their families or
such not as a policy  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also were
killed sometimes nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs

In case I have to remind you the difference  the majority of the attacks of
the Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians  They even tried to
justify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the army
at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets

   In addition they
   massacred an entire Palestinian village in  contributing
   to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their
   very lives

Yes these exceptions were tragic mistakes  I wasn't there and don't have
reffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away
most of the vilagers fled with several dozens  most of them claimed to be
fighters being killed

Those massaceres are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not
hounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period

	   I mention this not because I'm anti semitic I'm part
   Jewish but because this self righteousness on the part of the
   Israelites pisses me off so  I'm not as critical of the
   Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
   Jews  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for
   German and European anti semitism

What do you mean screwed over by the Jews  They began the ' war and
didn't accept the arrgenment planned by the UN  what did you expect the
Jews to do

				   Pissed off at Immature
			     Closeminded Self righteous

Not exactly the same but reminiscent of the assassination of Count
Bernadotte who was the UN negotiator during the  Israeli war of
independence  He was killed by the Israelis  Seems he was being too
successful in negotiating a ceasefire which would have worked
territorially against the nascent Israel compared to continued war

That operation was done by a small Jewish fraction BEFORE the state even
existed and as far as I remember was disaproved by most of the Jews

Saying that He was killed by the Israelis is plain wrong because there wasn't
Israel at the time

Look up the facts first post second  Bernadotte was assassinated
in September  by Lehi under the orders of its three commanders
one of whom was Yitzhak Shamir  There is no hard evidence of
complicity of the Israeli government despite some effort by the UN
and other organizations US intelligence Swedish government to
find it  However a great fuss was made over the apparent lack of
zeal of the Israeli government to track down the killers  The Lehi
man who actually pulled the trigger later became a personal friend
of David BenGurion  The best published account in English is A Ilan 
Bernadotte in Palestine  Macmillan

	The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled
from Jaffa andor who fled Jaffa or anywhere else in Israel having
the right to return is  Yes unfortunately they have the right to
return  They may apply for citizenship like any other nonIsraeli and
then go to Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now
own it  

	And now a question and answer for you  Can the Jews who were
born and raised in Hebron or their descendants go back to THEIR homes
in Hebron  The answer is absolutely NOT because they were almost all
murdered by their Arab neighbors  the palestinians

	Now do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit
their homes in Jaffa  Hell no  Bring back the Jews of Hebron Petah
Tikva Jerusalem Safed etc Then perhaps I would be in favor of Arabs
returning to their Jaffa homes  However seeing as no Arab has yet been
able to bring people back from the dead I'd say that's out

With all the hope in the world

       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS
    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities aired on Tuesday
    April  For the sake of brevity I'll present them in some separate
    points
Already say it the other week on CBC Snoozeworld


     As many other western programs this program was laid on a bed of
    misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the
    program on the viewer Some of the misinformations were as follows
Yeah I thought Bonanza was full of lies about the West

















     While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi
    aggression has been officially announced to be about  and even most
    radical counterrevolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total
    of one million dead this program claims that Iran alone has one million
    dead left from the war

     The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not  true For
    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that  It hurts me to
    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda The 
    translator says  It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly 
    research

     Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought
    by Iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to 
    undermine their nonmilitary uses without any reference to Iran's
    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in
    near future and its current deficit in electrical power


Why the hell would such an oil rich and hydroelectric potential to be
exploited spend billions on a nuclear energy programme

     The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of 
    Technology as a nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the
    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed
    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university Taking in account
    the scientific advancement of Sharif U in engineering fields and its
    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the
    lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries
    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones
    in scientific and industrial efforts

     A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA  in their numerous visits from
    Iran's different sites They say We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not  or  We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons

Yeah and we have every reason in the world to trust the Iranian regime
After all they've been so forward with us in the past

     As an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the
    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs
    William Triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking
    from the absolute knowledge

Maybe he is God

       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their
    country in western media and I hope Iranian authorities continue to
    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs
    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations

hahahahahahaahah

You don't see a difference between killing British soldiers who were

children


I mention this not because I'm anti semitic I'm part

That's ridiculuous on atleast two counts  First of all even if you identify
yourself as completely Jewish that doesn't rule out the possibility that you're
a selfhating antisemite  One can always find Jews who are uncomfortable with
their identities since they only want Jews to be cowering victims and are
willing to speak up for their enemies  Secondly the strength or weakness of
your arguments does not depend on your identity

Here you give positive accurate facts about what happened to the beduins
and the land

   After the creation of the State of Israel  percent of the Negev
   Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan The
    who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of
    hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 
   mm  a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out
   of three The rare water wells in the south and central Negev
   spring of life in the desert were cemented to prevent Bedouin
   shepherds from roaming

   A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev
   But after  when the Sinai was returned to Egypt these
   Bedouin were also eliminated At the same time strong pressure
   was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields
   in order that the land could be transferred to the army

And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there

   No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held
   today by Negev Bedouin It is a known fact that a large part of
   the  hectares they cultivated in the s has been seized
   by the Israeli authorities Indeed most of the Bedouin are now
   confined to seven development towns or sowetos established
   for them

   the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson email
   eliasismenntis

So what you basically say is that we know for sure that nothing good happens
there now  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived
and that they were driven away by the Jews  noone on earth knows about
what the Jews did there

Is that what you said  Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote

BTW  try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis  Not to mention
that there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one full
brigade of them

   Diaspora 'a cancer'
    by Julian Kossoff and Lindsay Schusman in
   Jewish Chronicle London  Dec 

   Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator AB Yehoshua
   launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth
   Council meeting in North London last week

   The diaspora he claimed was the cancer connected to the main
   tissue of the Jewish people He was scathing about its failure to
   act before the Holocaust


    deleted for bravity 


   Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life
   unlike in the diaspora where Jews had no responsibility for the
   country they lived in he said

   He warned that modern Hebrew a unifying force for the Jewish
   people would have to struggle for its future especially in
   literary circles It faced fierce competition from the English
   language

   

So

The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks

Another CPR NonFact

The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza some  people by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel

Actually they are free to leave and seek work in Egypt except that
the Egyptians don't want them either  And who are you going to blame
ifwhen Gazans establish their own state of GazaPalestine

While Polish nonJews risked their lives to save Jews from the
Ghetto no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
the Gazan resistance The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

Actually one such Jew who did risk his life to help Gazan Arabs was
hacked to death by Palestinean murderers just last week  It seems
that the risk has been primarily from the Arabs in need of help 

This is also true for telephone repairmen traders who seek to buy
agricultural products from Gazans Israeli soldiers who get involved
in fighting between feuding Palestinean groups that are as determined
to destroy each other as they are to destroy outsiders

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice A population denied basic human rights is entitled to
rise up against its tormentors

I just wanna see you try this here in the USA  You know what's going
to happen 

As is known the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of
Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel although they are
considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels shops
and fields Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in
Israel They may not live there for these areas are reserved for
the Master Race

Okay  That's enough  I'm not going to read this posting of yours any

The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history
of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without
antisemitism is impossible Zionism agrees with the basic tenet
of antiSemitism namely that Jews cannot live with non Jews

That's why the Zionists decided that Zion must be Gentilerein
What  They didn't  You mean to tell me that the early Zionists
actually granted CITIZENSHIP in the Jewish state to Christian and
Muslim people too

The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is
presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when
the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left We
were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War  Because of the
Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq Yossi Sarid 
currently Minister of the Environment  made his infamous
statement You look for me  ie I'am not making any more
efforts to speak with you From Yossi Sarid's point of view
Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew
or the danger of hunger it brought with it but whether or not the
Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party Similarly
MERETZ MK Deddi Tzuker recently faced with criticism from
residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his
government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and
peace responded by asking those present at the discussion whether
they would rather have a Likud government From the Leftists'
perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR
government regardless of what it does

These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the
future of the Occupied Territories will look and they want to
dictate to the Palestinians how to get there 

When someone starts criticizing the Leftists for not being Leftist
enough we get a pretty clear idea of what they believe to be normal
I hope that your not still calling yourself fair and unbiased Elias

 And in  the attack was a response

 SB finally retaliated  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that 
 SB the borders could be expanded
 
 I agree with all you write except that Terrorist orgs were not shelling
 Israel from the Golan Heights in  but rather from Lebanon 


Tsiel

I would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border
starting from the early 's  Certainly the PLO did shell Northern
Israel from the Arqoub region but Israel did much more shelling
destroying several South Lebanese villages  At the very least
we can say that both sides exchanged shelling with occasional
aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages
In any case Steve's characterization that the  invasion was only in 
response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false  Israel had
many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government
in Lebanon favorable to Israel and it nearly achieved this aim
with the election of Basheer El Gemayel and his brother Amin
El Gemayel but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard
to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw and Amin El Gemayel
had to abrogate the  th of May Agreement

   This is such Bullshit  Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on
   the part of the Jews and a massacre defines it best in my
   opinion  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the
   Jews a peace pact but the Irgun purposely broke this
   agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians  I might
   grant that this village housed armed Arabs I doubt it but
   nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
   this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun  The Deir Yassin
   MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
   Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homelandand contrary to
   your belief many civilians were killed  Deir Yassin was later
   advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was
   useful in getting many Palestinians to leave  The Palestinians
   were rightfully scared off because they did not want another
   Deir Yassin  
	   I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here
   atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs
   Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are
   and were the good guys in the middle east  Both Arab and Jew
   suck equally

rjs you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgun
to attack Dir Yassin was its strategic importance In fact Begin
who was in charge of the Irgun wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for
its military significance

Dir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation People died
But the thing was never intended to be a masacre That this hapenned
is a tragedy of war  not a crime of the Irgun

         What is a shame is that in Austria daily reports of
 the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing
 received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt
 go away After all look how the Jews are treating other races
 when they got power It is unfortunate
 
 
    This can be turned around  The Austrians who should feel guilty about
 their actions during WWII but don't justify their antisemetism by making
 every Israeli action into an atrocity  The Austrians Germans and other
 Europeans have extensive trading relations with the Arab block being 
 proArab is good for business  I don't think that ethics has a thing to

	Libertarians believe in an end to the welfare state an end to

Rabin We Must Concentrate on Qualitative Changes in Israeli
Society
 
Today's AL HAMISHMAR quotes Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
Independence Day interview yesterday on Israel Television Rabin
said that enforcing Jewish sovereignty over the entire Land of
Israel would lead to the establishment of a binational state I
would view it as if the historical destiny of my generation Dor
Tashach the generation that had the great privilege of determining
the fate of the people and founding the Jewish state had been
lost  Rabin added We must stop dreaming of settlements ie in
the Territories and focus on qualitative and substantive changes
in Israeli society to make it a productive society dependent on its
own labor The Prime Minister concluded saying that he would like
to achieve a significant breakthrough in the peace process during
his government's term

Peace Talks Resume Today Israel to Offer Palestinians New
Proposals
 
Israel Radio KOL YISRAEL reports on today's resumption in
Washington of the bilateral peace talks following a recess which
lasted over four months According to the report Israel is
expected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding the
authority of the Palestinian Executive Council general elections
control over land and human rights issues in the Territories
Israel will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control
of more land than previously offered According to the radio
report one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians
control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands as
well as broad authority on water issues Israel will seek to
promote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of
strengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the
peace negotiations According to Israel Radio the Israeli
delegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer
greater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council
allowing it certain legislative capabilities without making it a
symbol for Palestinian sovereignty US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering
tonight It will be the first such event since the Madrid
conference Head of the American team at the bilateral peace talks
Edward Djerejian said that tonight's gathering is meant to
demonstrate the US' active role in the peace process

I hope I hope that we can begin to involve ourselves in the issues
and concerns related to this peace process We have differing opinions
certainly on these aspects but it is clear that we all share the hope
that resolution of the tensions and conflict will happen

As we run to the defense of our side there is no need to constantly 
involve ourselves in namecalling All of us are regularly confused by
the other's reactive posting because they spend most of the post
applying labels and presenting slogans than in just presenting their
honest views Thenwhen we react we do the same thing


Do you as I do agree that this sort of peace process is needed
What about the particular points mentioned in the article Is what
Israel is supposedly going to propose good Does it go too far
Not far enough

If you don't agree that a peace process is needed what is

Is this means that  the number of the people have been killed by Israel are so
high that you can not keep the track of or this is also a part of Zionism 
ideology that you don't need to keep  the track of the people you kill 
Just kill

If you know that the number is so high would you care to provide it  
To tell you the truth Hamid most of those killed by the Israeli Army were
agressors who were invading or attacking Israel with the intention of murdering
Jews and destroying the Jewish State  Thus I have no sympathy for them and
I really don't give a damn about how many were killed

It is all so changed by now but in case any of you is
interested in what I actually said I never compared the
Israeli treatment of the palestinians with the Holocaust
Anyway that is the truth if it matters I was about to forget
about it myself since everyone started calling me antisemitic
for making the comparison that I never made What I did say was
that the Nazis didn't start with the Holocaust and their
initial actions were similar to what the Israelis are doing now
	The Jews that were stranded on the polish border since
no country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the

   Steve

I do not say that freedom of speech should be banned Far from it
I am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be
universally agreed to be morally incorrect There are not many such
things But there are some As an example

 murder is morally incorrect

 the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to
another is morally incorrect

etc

The point is that any action which serves to promote a morally
incorrect action should be forbidden This implies that no one has the
right to say that an innocent person should be murdered Regardless of
freedom of speech I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the
murder of innocent people The reason for this is that murder is a
morally incorrect action

In the same way since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow
definition which we have given it  I nor any one else has the
right to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry Such an
enforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by
the first amendment It merely ensures that no person may be the
target of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right such as
the right to not be murdered and the right not to be discriminated
against

I believe Mr Berson that to blindly accept the constitution is a
terrific mistake We must cinstantly question the constitution and
interpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live Anything
short of such an effort would render us little more than trained
monkeys who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without
paying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in
question

Would you disagree MrBerson

  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's question in an intelligent
  and unoffending manner                                       
       
  Now will we please start having some INTELLIGENT conversation
                                           

and then he shows us what HE means by intelligent and unoffending manner 
and INTELLIGENT conversation   

  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles

   deleted lines
                                                    

   Later he reveals the truth

   I mention this not because I'm anti semitic I'm part Jewish 
                                   
   deleted lines 

   Shurely he IS an antiSemite call it antiJew maybe BECAUSE he
   is part Jewish  eg his mother might have dated  a Jew who
   didn't marry her and so she got a little bastard whom she taught
   hatred  
   
   He is also a coward since he doesn't dare to sign with his name  
   At the end he signs with a highly intelligent and intellectual 
   phrase

  You know ed   You're right  Andi shouldn't be comparing
  Israel to the Nazis  The Israelis are much worse than the
  Nazis ever were anyway  The Nazis did a lot of good for
  Germany and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the
  damn Jews  The Holocaust never happened anyway  Ample
  evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard Dept of History
  and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU have shown that the
  Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
  sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel

   The  Nazis  might also have sent this bastard to the gas chambers
   because of his part Jewishness only that he is not aware of it

  This is actually the law that David Irving
 will hopefully be found guilty under due to his denial of the Holocaust
 It's too bad that this useless Centre for Policy Research isn't in Canada
 It'd set a nice precedent to how the law applies in Cyberspace

	Well canada is wrong 

Talk about generalizations  Indeed you DO sound quite immature

If it was in the US the ACLU would have
made sure that such repressive laws are found unconstitutional

What  The ACLU fighting against an antihate law  You mean that the
ACLU would support gaybashing racial discrimination and antisemitic
violence  Thanks Andi for reminding us that the constitution
preserves our rights to such fun activities

Do you think the Church didn't find Galileo's perception of the
universe offensive

Probably but Galileo happened to be right

Jews are offended by the Holocaust deniers too  The Revisionists
who deny that history even happened happen to be wrong

  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles  This
Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism 

You obviously haven't read his postings clearly

The only
ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact
are the Israelophiles  

Israelophiles  Is this anything like Israelists  You're treading on
thin ice here

You all are an insult to you race

Now you're falling through the ice  Barfie  We have a playmate for
you 

	Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
during the 's and 's  The Hirgun and other branch 
off militant groups did fight the British do get them out of
Palestine  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs  

There is a difference between guerrilla warfare and terrorism
The former primarily targets enemy soldiers  The latter primarily
targets civilians and not necessarily enemy civilans at that

These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers 

Innocent British soldiers  Like innocent Iraqi soldiers
THe British were EXECUTING Jewish fighters in what was soon to become
the recognized Jewish homeland  The British  to their eternal shame
and damnation  were sending shiploads of Jewish refugees civilians
back to Europe to be taken care of by Hitler

By comparison Palestinean fighters primarily target tourists
schoolchildren babies worshippers shoppers moviegoers and other
such threatening people  Early Zionist fighters did no such things

Your comparison is ignorant and odious

	I mention this not because I'm anti semitic I'm part
Jewish but because this self righteousness on the part of the
Israelites pisses me off so  

Does it bug you that the Israelites they used to be
Israelophiles happen to be right

I'm not as critical of the
Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
Jews  

Are you kidding  Palestinean Arabs  who comprise a tiny proportion 
of the world's refugee population who have almost no justifiable
claim to the territory that they desire who have acted as criminals
in the international community for decades  are being treated like
the most aggrieved and deserving minority in existence even after
their ignominious support for Saddam in Desert Storm  How many other
world leaders have addressed the UN with a machinegun in hand
receiving a standing ovation

It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for
German and European anti semitism

You are now parrotting some of the weakest arguments of the
terrorists' apologists  Congratulations

  ALL Jews suffered during WWII not just our beloved who perished or were

 others suffered physically 
 
 I'm just waiting for Andi to tell us that African Americans should
 start paying compensation to White Americans who suffered from being 
 slave owners

	Do you have a problem with the language I said
everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the
victims of Holocaust 

There were a great many Germans Poles and others who did not
sympathize with the victims of the Holocaust but instead participated
with enthusiasm in the killing

The Holocaust wasn't a massacre it wasn't even killing for sport it
was an entire Industry of Death  German engineers architects
technicians and bureaucrats proudly put their best efforts into as
efficient and methodical a Killing Machine as they could devise and
operate  And it certainly was something extraordinary

Please don't bleat to us about how the Nazis suffered from the
Holocaust

I wasn't implying that anyone suffered
more than the actual victims 

But what you DID do when Waldo wrote
  All Jews suffered during WWII 
was correct him with
  All humans suffered 

So what WERE you implying

Neither was I implying any
wrongdoing on the part of the Jews as the cause for the
Holocaust 

Are we supposed to thank you for your generosity  
Or should we be pleased with your minimal common sense

What is wrong with you guys Regardless of what one 
says you keep hearing what you want to hear 

Why is it that when someone writes something simple like All Jews
sufffered during WWII that YOU feel the burning need to add
commentary  Regardless of what people write you keep trying to twist
things into what YOU want to hear  People with similar tendencies in
more extreme form are sometimes called Historical Revisionists  Is
this something that you aspire to

It seems that Egypt is only interested in fighting wars against its own
people while objecting to any steps for Bosnia I am not surprised
WHo said that Mubarak represents Egypt Hell he does not even represent
all the criminals of Egypt

clarinewsclarinetcom ANWAR IQBAL writes

	ISLAMABAD UPI  Representatives from  Islamic nations were
considering Tuesday a request from BosniaHerzegovina for  million
and weapons to fight the Bosnian Serbs

	The only commitment so far is  million from Saudi Arabia which

Thanks Saudia for the pocket change
Compare that to the Liberation of Q and to what they gave to some
weird causes OK at least they are paying

has already donated  million to BosniaHerzegovina
	Sources on the political committee said delegates were in agreement
on the need to help the Bosnian Muslims but the request for weapons had
delayed a decision
	It may interpreted as violating the United Nations' embargo on
supplying arms to Bosnia'' warned Egyptian Foreign Minister Amer
Moussa

Mr Amr Moussa was not worried about International law when he tortured
to death  many of his citizens and when he shot people praying in a Mosque
or when he is causing trouble to his neighbor just becasue the CIA says so
Why doesn't he just shut up he won't be involved in any Bosnian effort
anyway or does the west have to be represented even in an Islamic conference

The more I hear about the Egyptian regime the more I understand the
existence of the Jamaa Islamiyah there After all most of its members
and leaders are former and current victims of government torture injustice
or relatives of victims In some other places they get psychiatric care AND
revenge in the COURTS But all they got is more of the same resulting  in a 
cycle of madness that is initiated by the government with the illicit support 
of the west who is more concerned about the safety of half naked tourists in
conservative neighborhoods than the dignity social justice and safety of the
majority of the poor oppressed people of Egypt Enough said

To all Apologists to the US imperialism watch the movie Romero

There are basically three alternatives for Gaza

  To throw the Jews to the sea that is basically to make them leave
   the MiddleEast and go back to where they came from russia Europe USA etc
  To throw the Gazans into the sea in accordance with Yitzhak Rabin's
     wish and that of many Zionists
  For Israelis and Palestinians to come to an honorable and fair I
   don't attempt to say just settlement which would allow each person
   to live in dignity in his country in freedom and equality

I personnaly opt for the third alternative How about you folks

Hope heshe doesnt mind


By Lance Gay ScrippsHoward News Service
 
SARAJEVO BosniaHerzegovina  In this land of historic hatreds a tiny
Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a yearold debt to
Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust
 
Ivica Ceresnjes president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo says he
and about  other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo rather than leave
for Israel to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district
running
 
Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during
the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuriesold presence of 
Jews living in Sarajevo
 
Some with guns are defending Bosnia but I fight in Bosnia by keeping 
people alive'' Ceresnjes said
 
As a student of Balkan history Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and 
had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly A year before the war
erupted here last April Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began
stockpiling supplies ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for
places in Israel and Europe for the evacuees
 
They were so well prepared he said that only five days after the
shooting began the first plane left Of about  Jews in Bosnia
Herzegovina he estimates half have left Many of those who stayed behind
work in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue which has been turned into a
wartime feeding center that has so far given away  meals
 
The center which has been shelled several times along with most of
Sarajevo also runs a radio station mail center and distributes food
packages sent by Jewish organizations around the world
 
While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast Jews here
say there's a long tradition of cooperation intermarriage and
tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to
centuries of Turkish occupation
 
Sarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman
Catholic Spain in  The community numbered more than  before
World War II But only  survived the Holocaust  which was carried out
by the proNazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia Many of the survivors were
hidden by Muslim families in Mostar

BH I would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border
BH starting from the early 's  Certainly the PLO did shell Northern
BH Israel from the Arqoub region but Israel did much more shelling
BH destroying several South Lebanese villages  At the very least
BH we can say that both sides exchanged shelling with occasional
BH aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages
BH In any case Steve's characterization that the  invasion was only in 
BH response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false  Israel had
BH many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government
BH in Lebanon favorable to Israel and it nearly achieved this aim
BH with the election of Basheer El Gemayel and his brother Amin
BH El Gemayel but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard
BH to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw and Amin El Gemayel
BH had to abrogate the  th of May Agreement

Basil

I was only correcting Steve's statement that Geurillas were shelling Israel
from the Golan which was absurd
The fact that Israel did much more shelling was in response to Palestinian
shelling from Lebanon Israel has no intention of keeping an inch of Lebanese
territory Israel will continue to fight Hizbullah PLO FPLP etc as long as
its northern border is not quiet If the Lebanese army can control these 
elements then I think we can see genuine peace on the IsraelLebanese border
I remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to 
work
As for the election of Bashir Gemayel it is true that he was favorable to
Israel is that why the Syrians killed him His brother Amin was a Syrian 
puppet if he had not been he would have been dead by now

TC Do you as I do agree that this sort of peace process is needed
TC What about the particular points mentioned in the article Is what
TC Israel is supposedly going to propose good Does it go too far
TC Not far enough

TC If you don't agree that a peace process is needed what is

I personally think that a peace process is needed since only through
negotiations will the future generations be able to live in stability
Unfortunately not all think like this we have cases like
	Anas Omran Hamza Saleh Jle Mohammed Reza Mehmed AbuAbed 
Anwar Mohammed and others who think that JIHAD is the only solution 

I wish that people including myself would have more objective views like Tim
Basil and Shai for example and put the rhetoric aside and start discussing
substance

My view is that Israel has made more gestures towards its Arab foes than the
opposite What have the Sysrians given to us or proposed What have the
Palestinians proposed If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their 
charter or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good
start
The Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations Its seems though
that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are
plagued by internal strife that is why we are not getting anywhere
Fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories then it will be
too late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only
vow for the destruction of Israel
Arabs  must take example on Egypt Egypt came to the bargaining table
got what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation
between the two countries 
The tougher you play ball with Israel the tougher Israel gets

Source Stanford J Shaw on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian
armies in  History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey Volume
II Reform Revolution  Republic The Rise of Modern Turkey 
London Cambridge University Press  pp 

In April  Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van whose  Armenians comprised  percent of the population 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the EmpireLeaving Erivan 
 on April   Armenian volunteers reached Van on May  and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days

Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories Armenian political leaders army officers and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves

With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in  at the beginning of
 World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies


Source Stanford J Shaw History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey
        Vol II Cambridge University Press London  pp 

Meanwhile Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final
 plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans with the 
 president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response

 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
  glorious Russian Army with their blood to serve the victory of Russian
  armsLet the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the

An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection and it 
 appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away it might be
 able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian
 civilization An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from
 the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
 Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet' Thousands of Armenians from
 Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new 
 Armenian stateBy midJuly there were as many as  Armenians
 crowded into the Van area which before the crisis had housed and fed
 no more than  people Muslim and nonMuslim alike

The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over  square miles The estimated population
 of the entire region in  was  of whom   percent were
 Armenian   percent Georgian and   percent Moslem
 Of the latter group  were Tatars Paradoxically barely onethird
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds Erevan
 uezd the administrative center of the province had only  Armenians
 as compared to  Moslems By the time of the Russian Census of 
 however the Armenians had established a scant majority  percent in the
 guberniia it had risen by  to  percent or  of the 
 inhabitants This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic a solid block of  Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village 
 Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead

During the First World War and the ensuing years   
the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic 
genocide tried to complete its centuriesold policy of 
annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 
 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their  year 
homeland

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the th Century acted upon an entire people

You make it sound as if the turks are as inocent as a teenaged virgin about
to get married  Go and read about the atrocities commited by the turks 
against the Greeks during the period of time Greece was occupied by the
turks  Now you expect that turks living in Greece should be treated like

So the Greek educational system is also in a shambles History shows 
that within the last  years Greeks played that game twice They 
used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in  to instigate the Morea 
rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people Again 
the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V invited the Russian Czar Nicholas 
II to invade the Ottoman Empire 'in the name of Jesus' and save his 
flock from Ottoman rule

  the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire which had been going on
  for a century was disastrous for Ottoman Jewry This was the age of
  nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan starting with
  the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century which based on
  the Megali Idea or Great Idea sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul
  and large portions of Anatolia union of which with Greece was felt to be
  the 'dream and hope of all' The success of the Greek national movement
  provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the
  efforts of the Greeks themselves stimulated similar uprisings among the
  other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed not so
  much by the Ottomans but rather by the Greek religious hierarchy which
  dominated the Orthodox millet leading first to pressure for religious
  independence granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in  to the
  Serbian Church in  and to the Rumanian Church in  with subsequent
  aspirations for and achievement of political independence following

  page 

  They new nationalist leaders were greatly assisted in their
   campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular
   representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian
   missionaries who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and
   hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as
   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence

   Christian nationalism based as much on religious as on ethnic identity
   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews
   and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past
   Vicious antiMuslim and antiSemitic movements developed involving
   largescale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies
   by the independent states that resulted also by Christian subjects
   who remained within the Empire particularly because of Jewish and Muslim
   support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent
   nationalist states of Southeastern Europe The results were explosive
   and damaging

   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting
   nationalists and later successfully established independent Christian
   states committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout
   the nineteenth century despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary
   in the treaties of Paris  and Berlin 

  page 

  As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence
   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and
   massacred and those who survived were driven beyond the evershrinking
   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which
   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries
   earlier

   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth
   century with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead as united
   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth
   century In  the ruler of Moldavia Peter the Lame banished its
   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants When
   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian
   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in  he ordered the massacre
   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest

  page 

  The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century When the
  Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from
  Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and
  plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through
  Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece

  page  second paragraph

  When Venice occupied the island of Chios in  its Jewish population
   was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal
   property was stolen by the native Greek population leaving those Jews
   who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging no longer able to
   compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce

  page  third paragraph

  Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly
   because of their support for Ottoman rule When the Greek nationalist
   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia
   during the spring of  hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by
   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs  During
   the height of the Greek revolution five thousand Jews were massacred
   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population numbering about
   twenty thousand in all  In Tripolizza alone  Jews were
   massacred along with uncounted Turks   Reverend John Hartley
   after describing the carnage concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood mingled
   with Turkish flow down the streets of captured city The sons of Isaac
   and the sons of Ishmael on this as well as on every occasion during the
   Greek Revolution met with common fate Their corpses were cast out of the
   city and like the ancient sovereign of Judah they received no burial
   superior to that of an ass'  Jewish communities on the islands of
   Sparta Patras Corinthos Mistra and Argos were wiped out by bands of
   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes Vrachori Attica and Epirus 
   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu where Jews who had fled
   from Italy and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity
   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century though divided into
   rival Greek and Italian communities It was not long however before
   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution leading to savage repression
   and massacres of Jews forcing the surviving members of the two communities
   to come together for selfdefense for the first time Throughout the years
   of Greek revolution Greek nationalists went from town to town on the
   mainland and from island to island in the Agean exterminating all the
   Jews and Muslims they could find many along the roads as they desperately
   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire Contemporary
   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying
   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards  Most of
   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats
   to Izmir thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman
   Jewish life during the nineteenth century Only in Northern Greece
   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica were the Jews and the
   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults thus saving their
   populations from massacre as well  During the remainder of the th
   century particularly during the GreekTurkish war in  those Jews
   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens Chalkis Larissa Corfu
   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre forcing thousands
   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory particularly to Salonica and
   Izmir 

   page  last paragraph

   The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing
   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe
   stimulated more popular antiSemitic and antiMuslim hysteria in all
   the countries involved with bloodlibel accusations once again being
   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as
   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers merchants and
   professionals a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian
   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire Because the Bulgarians
   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the
   Turks both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally
   atrocious and brutal manners Their property was plundered and their
   homes and shops taken over without compensation while the survivors
   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul While official statements
   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews little was done
   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the
   twentieth century

  page  last paragraph

  Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the
   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean In  the
   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due
   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations  Many of
   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a
   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of
   the Banque Camondo In  and  and again in  and 
   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms
   in Russia which went on between  and  with only slight periods
   of respite In  Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from
   persecution in Vidin in independent Bulgaria

   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian
   forces during the Balkan Wars  including Salonica Corlu
   and Edirne was followed by general attacks on Jews their synagogues
   homes and shops in both countries  resulting in a renewed exodus
   toward Istanbul and beyond Two reports from Salonica graphically
   described the situation caused by the invading armies

      'All the selfinterested justifications of the newspapers of Europe
      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth can never
      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the
      entry of the Greeks in Salonica A week of terror and horror one can
      never easily forget The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the
      damage that the explosion of hatred by the Greek population has done
      to their cause The mob has shown itself odious and the government
      weakThe incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors
      inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation The
      consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims but sixty of
      them were massacred in a single night'

     'It wasn't only irregulars Comitacis who massacred pillaged and
      burned The soldiers of the Army the Chief of Police and the high
      civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres Out of
       houses  were burned Almost  shops were consumed by
      flames and destructive bombs The Jewish population lost all and
      without even anything to wear is in despair Everyone wants to
      emigrate'


  page 

    As a result of these assaults massacres and forced deportations from
   the independent countries of Southeastern Europe the Ottoman Empire
   received literally thousands of Jewish refugees who joined the Muslims
   who survived the persecution flooding into the Empire

And this is just the beginning Fascist xSoviet Armenian Government will 
not get away with the genocide of  million Turks and Kurds and  
Azeri people Your criminal grandparents committed unheardof crimes 
resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism organized massacres 
poured petrol over babies and burned them raped women and girls in front 
of their parents who were bound hand and foot took girls from their 
mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate 
And today they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other

Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of  
 million Muslim people

Foreword

For example we were camped one night in a halfruined Tartar mosque 
 the most habitable building of a destroyed village near the border 
 of Persia and Russian Armenia During the course of evening I asked 
 Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and 
 the cause of its destruction In his matter of fact way he replied Yes 
 I assisted in its sack and destruction and witnessed the slaying of 
 those whose bones you saw today scattered among its ruins 

p  first and second paragraphs

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village 
 Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead 

p  second paragraph

The Tartars were for the most part poor Some of them lived in villages 
 and cultivated small farms many of them continued in the way of life of 
 their nomadic forefathers They drove their flocks and herds from valley 
 to valley from plain to mountain and from mountain to plain following 
 the pasturage as it changed with the seasons They ranged from the salt 
 desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains 
 Even the village Tartars are a primitive people only semicivilized

I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars and while 
 holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country regarded and
 treated them as inferiors The fact that the Russians looked down upon all
 Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars far from proving
 a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors intensified
 an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility

p  second paragraph

Our men armed themselves gathered together and advanced on the Tartar
 section of the village There were no lights in the houses and the doors
 were barred for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great 
 fear Our men hammered on the doors but got no response whereupon they
 smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last
 Tartar was slain Throughout the hideous night I cowered at home in terror
 unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and
 the loud shouts of our men By morning the work was finished

p  second paragraph

As things were the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative
 experience consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself
 incompetent to rule by legitimate means

 The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and
 outside the law When they became a legally instituted recognized governing
 body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands they proved incompetent to 
 do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their 
 fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days

 The outstanding feature of their rule now that they were in power was
 as in the old days trial and execution without hearing A man evoking
 the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and
 condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him The method 
 of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the
 condemned man in his home or on the street place a pistol to the back
 of his head and blow out his brains This simple way of getting rid of
 those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became
 a common way of paying debts

p  first paragraph

A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar I saw the
 point of the weapon emerge through his back Another soldier seized a rock 
 and pounded the Tartar's head with it The Armenian who had bayoneted him
 sprang to his feet wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body and raising
 it to his lips licked it clean of blood exclaiming in Russian 'Slodkey
 Slodkey' Sweet

p  second paragraph

One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village Among the 
 ruins a fire was burning I went to the fire and saw seated about
 it a group of soldiers Among them were two Tartar girls mere children
 The girls were crouched on the ground crying softly with suppressed
 sobs Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and
 other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes There were also bodies of the
 dead

p  first paragraph

I was soon asleep In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of
 a child I arose and went to investigate A full moon enabled me to make
 my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy
 that had been enacted Guided by the child's crying I entered the yard of
 a house which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a
 Turkish family There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead Her
 throat had been cut Lying on her breast was a small child a girl about a
 year old

p 

Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow the cart
 jolting and the loads swaying Boys ran along the line of oxen encouraging
 them with shrill Tartar cries and belaboring the beasts with sticks In the
 carts the women veiled as is the Tartar way held children in their arms
 Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they
 sought protection from the wind and cold A few old men plodded along on foot

 Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown The leading
 oxteam reached this barrier and halted The gunmen and other ruffians 
 concealed among the rocks opened fire Women and children leaped and
 scrambled from the carts screamed ran and sought vainly for safety

 This massacre was not complete The Armenian soldiers in the nearby 
 barracks hearing the firing and the turmoil hurried to the scene
 That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted
 and completely destroyed

p 

Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hidingplaces on the
 retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced They entered
 into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores
 that had been left by the Turks

p 

Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars Kurds and Turks Their villages
 were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country

p 

The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order
 of diminishing intensity Tartars Kurds and Russians 

p  First and second paragraphs

Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villagesWe Armenians 
 did not spare the TartarsIf persisted in the slaughtering of prisoners 
 the looting and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace 
 actions expected and accepted as a matter of course

 I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground
 in numbers like the fallen leaves in a forest They had been as helpless
 and as defenseless as sheep They had not died as soldiers die in the
 heat of battle fired with ardor and courage with weapons in their hands
 and exchanging blow for blow They had died as the helpless must with
 their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself

p  first paragraph

In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who
 had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians
 abandoned the struggle During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of
 these poor devils were cruelly put to death I was sickened by the
 brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest Some
 mercifully were shot Many of them were burned to death The method
 employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after
 crowding the hut with Turks set fire to the straw

p  first paragraph

The Tartar section of the town no longer existed except as a pile of
 ruins It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered The same 
 fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi

p  second paragraph

Many of our men had served in the Russian Army and were trained soldiers
 We Armenians were rich and possessed arms Tartars had never received
 military training They were poor and possessed few arms beyond knives
 Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village the revolution
 in Russia was suppressed

p  third paragraph

Within a few years following the beginning of the movement an invisible
 government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish 
 Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government This secret 
 government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called
 'Mauserists' professional killers to enforce its decrees

p  first paragraph

The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish 
 Government

p  third paragraph

the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish
 Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene
 and secure independence for Turkish Armenia

p  second paragraph

The Dashnacks were fanatics           

p  third paragraph

The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their 
 revolutionary activities into the Russian province They instituted 
 a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing
 contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians A wealthy
 man would be assessed a stipulated sum Refusal to pay brought upon
 him a sentence of death 

 Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without 
 question If a man were to be assassinated lots might be drawn to
 select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the
 'mauserists' of the party

p  first paragraph

in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars they 
 Armenians have been remorseless in seeking vengeance

p  third paragraph

The city was a scene of confusion and terror During the early days of 
 the war when the Russian troops invaded Turkey large numbers of the 
 Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian 
 advance

p  second paragraph

I made a cannon a huge gun to lift which required four men I made balls
 for it With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar
 houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out

p  first paragraph

The Tartar villages were in ruins

p  third paragraph

The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood his 
 beard still setaceous and now crimsoned

There are basically three alternatives for Gaza

 Annex Gaza to Egypt
 Annex Gaza to Israel
 Maintain the status quo
 Partition Gaza into a Jewish and an Arab state

	I don't necisarily support any of these I just felt like
pointing out there are way more than three solutions  Next time

 In article AprVirginiaEDU rjsVirginiaEDU Get thee to a nunnery writes

 rjs you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgun
 to attack Dir Yassin was its strategic importance In fact Begin
 who was in charge of the Irgun wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for
 its military significance

 Dir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation People died
 But the thing was never intended to be a masacre That this hapenned
 is a tragedy of war  not a crime of the Irgun

I agree with you Harry however you must also concede then that
Arab terrorism is also a tragedy of war

	No one is forced to blow up airplanes  Terrorism is a choice
made by people because they do not want to work for peace

remember that the
Palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in
order to further their cause

	There are lots of military targets in Israel  There are
lots of legitamate targets in Israel  Old ladies children and
civilians in general are not acceptable targets

	If the only person you can kill is a civilian you hold your
fire  If that means you can't kill anyone then you can't kill
anyone  Claiming that civilain targets are acceptable because they
are easy kills is rediculous

If Irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that
they might obtain some objective I'm sure they would have done so

	Did they make a policy of it

I also don't
exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism

	Did you mean excuse   Killing a soldier and killing a
civilian are two very different acts

The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with
regards to Palestine and the Irgun and branch off groups made
a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and
fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued
presence in Palestine

	No they killed soldiers so that the British government would
leave  The objective was not to scare civilains but show that the cost
of staying was way too high  

	In contrast a terrorist kills civilains to scare other
civilains  They use random violence against people to make a point
that no one is safe until their demands are met  An analogy would be
the Irgun blowing up Harrods or  Downing

  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me and not much removed from
Arab terrorism

	Thats because you missed the essential point of arab
terrorism which is to scare civilains away from Israel by killing
those who have something to do with Israel  It is to kill Jews
because they might be Zionists  It is to kill people who live in
Israel because of where they live  The targets are rarely soldiers
or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of
duty but innocent civilians to underscore the message that no one
who deals with Israel is safe

	I'll reiterate again both sides are screwy but
I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they
were a bit screwed

	Oh you mean you favor the Israelis outnumbered  to 
outgunned surrounded by hostile states only one of which has signed a
peace treaty in  years  You favor the Jews people like Leon
Klofhinger a cripple who was thrown off a boat because he was Jewish
You support the right of the Jewish people to live in peace

	Why thank you for your support

	Huh  Mohamed Salimeh was perhaps a Korean  How do you claim
arabamericans had no involvement in the WTC bombing

	Ok his involvement is alleged by the FBI which doesn't seem
to reliable these days  But honestly there is a pile of evidence
pointing to them and it seems those  were involved

	This does not mean that all arabamericans were involved nor

In a previous article bcclevelandFreenetEdu Mark Ira Kaufman says

   How many of you readers know anything about Jews living in the
Arab countries  How many of you know if Jews still live in these
countries  How many of you know what the circumstances of Arabic
Jews leaving their homelands were  Just curious

the last arab country was syria but not all of them
migrated due to the jewish state economical and
securital dilemma

I have no idea what this guy means but the Syrian Jews are not allowed
to leave Syria because Assad welshed on his promise and is not letting
them go Israel has nothing to do with it

As for the other Arab countries there are still small communities left
in some Arab countries Morocco has the largest group I think comprising
perhaps just over a thousand but I have lost the exact figure Maybe
someone will be so kind as to post it There are communities left in
Yemen which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a
freeish election Algeria this is a tiny group a couple of leftist
intellectuals I think of course Syria and Lebannon

The circumstances of the departure of the Jews from various Arab countries
is controversial in some cases  like Iraq  and I do not want to get into
a dispute about it Egypt expelled most of its community outright Most of
the French North African Jews left rather than face Independence I think
that Moroccans might have been encouraged by some AntiSemitic acts but I
am not sure Someone else around here will know for sure There are claims
that Israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around Algeria that the
Jews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda It would
take a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to France
as most did or to Israel Yemeni Jews were airlifted to Israel Those
left were rumoured to have another airlift last year but I heard nothing
about it so I guess it was just a rumour Any I left out except Iraq

	Wow if you were the only source of news around the
world it would seem that Israel is being treated unfairly

	Ok you don't like what I have to say  Would you care to
demonstrate how the above list or any expanded version of it you
chose to post demonstrates fairness in the actions of the UN wrt
Israel

luckily that is not the case I suggest reading european
papers rather than Israeli propaganda Arab papers wouldn't
hurt either to see the propaganda of the other side

	You make the odd assumption that I read Israeli papers not
European ones  My main source of news is the Economist a London
based magazine

	Also I do on rare occaisons read Arab papers but its hard
to find English language papers from Arab countries here

 Anyway
you are an example of what happens when people chose what to
read Don't get me wrong it is perfectly within your rights
Just don't go off acting like you're objective

	Have I ever claimed to be objective  I pointed out with a 
item list that Israel is condemned for actions that other nations are
not condemned for  You go off and attack me for reading only Israeli
newspapers

	If you'd like to debate this please do  If you'd like to
make ad hominum attacks feel free to do that too  But try not to
mask one as another

 I'm unclear here Are you saying that these events DID NOT occurr
 As you know the UN neither condemned nor expressed outrage at any
 of the events listed I retained those that reflected policies
 of murder and abuse Is that an irrelevent fact to you
 
 While I do expect Israel's abusive policies to be condemned
 where appropriate are you saying that you do not notice any
 degree of selective morality on the UN's part Do you also
 find it convenient and easy to blithely ignor particular abhorrant
 acts simply because the perpetrators don't happen to be on your
 bad guys list

	I have to say I think this is the first time there has
been something posted that opposed me without making personal
insults Congradulations tim I think the other people answered
you on most of the factual partsesp about the internal
conflicts policy 
	Israel very often gets away with more
than most other nations Due to US vetos While I am not
familiar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi
Arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the
pilgrims were iranian Yes the UN is biased but mostly in
favor of the US and its allies Including Israel Saudi Arabia
and Pakistan and against Outlaw countries like iran and more
recently Iraq Far be it from me to support the repressive
governments there but I think they get more slack than Israel
for things they do wrong Again the reason some condemnations
don't occur lies in the race or country of the victims The
gassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and
since Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation
resulted The palestinians killed by arab countries involved
another case of who cares It seems that until very recently no
one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere including
in Israel and the occupied territories
	Again I appreciate the lack of personal insults

In the following report Turkey Eyes Regional Role ANKARA Turkey AP

Turanist Although Premier Suleyman Demirel criticized Ozal's often
Turanist brash calls for more Turkish influence he also has spoken
Turanist of a swath of Turkic peoples stretching from the Adriatic
Turanist Sea to the Great Wall of China

Who does Demirel think he is fooling It seems at both ends of his envisioned 
panTurkic Empire  the Balkans and the Caucasus  Turkey's fascist boasts
are being preempted

I would suggest Turkey let the world feel some of their Grey Wolf Teeth and
attempt to stretch from the Adriatic to China Turkey will have cried wolf

 	ISLAMABAD UPI  Representatives from  Islamic nations were
 considering Tuesday a request from BosniaHerzegovina for  million

 	The only commitment so far is  million from Saudi Arabia which
 
 Thanks Saudia for the pocket change
 Compare that to the Liberation of Q and to what they gave to some
 weird causes OK at least they are paying

Damned if you do and Damned if you don't

 
 has already donated  million to BosniaHerzegovina
 	Sources on the political committee said delegates were in agreement
 on the need to help the Bosnian Muslims but the request for weapons had
 delayed a decision
 	It may interpreted as violating the United Nations' embargo on
 supplying arms to Bosnia'' warned Egyptian Foreign Minister Amer
 Moussa
 
 Mr Amr Moussa was not worried about International law when he tortured
 to death  many of his citizens and when he shot people praying in a Mosque
 or when he is causing trouble to his neighbor just becasue the CIA says so
 Why doesn't he just shut up he won't be involved in any Bosnian effort
 anyway or does the west have to be represented even in an Islamic conference

Just for the record Egyptian troops were one of the first to be
stationed there I can't remember the exact date but it was late last
year In fact they lost at least one man there as far as I know

Zinaida On March  we arrived in Yerevan and the next day they registered
us at the train station and took us to the boarding house The conditions were
wonderful thanks to our Armenians who received us But it's not relaxing all
the same I don't know how everyone else feels about it but for me it's 
torture We don't have a place to call our own I had a two bedroom apartment 
in Sumgait my children went to school and we lived well in friendship It's 
painful that in our times in  in the Soviet period people can break 
into our apartment and try to kill me and my children in whom I've put all my
efforts and my whole youth Everything was going well for us my older 
daughter was studying at the Institute the middle one was preparing to enter 
medical school and was interning as an orderly and my youngest had been sick 
for a long time but had returned to health I have been though a lot in my 
life it's been seven years since I lost my husband I raised my children by 
myself Lots of women have similar fates but there's nothing to be done about
it But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on 
February   and  it was just a horror it's indescribable

On February  our relative Ira came to visit us She's better friends with
my oldest daughter and so right away she asked Where's Vika I say
Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days she's supposed to come back
tomorrow My middle daughter Gaya had baked a cake and we sat there talking
and laughing drinking tea Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home

They left and a few minutes went by suddenly I hear noise I raced out to
the balconyour balcony is right across from the bus station we live at the
corner of Mir and Druzhba StreetsI look and see that there are hoards of
people near the bus station and they're all shouting something What they're
shouting I can't understand Our neighbor is standing on his balcony too I
ask Nufar what's happened He says I don't know I can't figure it out
either I got scaredthe kids had gone outside and I wanted to run after
them but then there was a knock at the door I open the door and it's the
kids Mamma says Gayane you'll never believe what's going on out there 
It's awful Ira says Aunt Zina they're shouting 'Karabagh Karabagh 
Karabagh is ours' We didn't know what was going on They're threatening to 
drive out the Armenians and slaughter them

I called my brother and his wife answered the phone I said Aunt Tamara 
don't worry Ira is staying here with us and we'll see her home later I 
couldn't shut my eyes all night long even until morning I was worried about
Vika My God what was going on what had happened

Gayane That day on the th we stood on the balcony and observed what was 
happening although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it There weren't 
 yards between our building and the bus station We could see and hear 
everything perfectly They were stopping buses dragging people out leading 
all the passengers out looking for Armenians If they found an Armenian on 
the bus then it started   I don't know what to call it   

Zinaida It's called slaughter

Gayane The mob would descend on people and beat them I don't know if they 
were killing them or not but when they left them they lay still not moving
as though nothing was left of them One person was lying there and they 
started dragging him The police were standing right there to the side not 
doing anything they didn't take any steps to calm that mob

It was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony And you 
couldn't go anywhere somehow    you wanted to be able to see everything
so as to tell of it later We wanted to leave Sumgait that day What kept us
was the idea that we live in the Soviet Union and that something would be
done about it Where in the world was our government

Zinaida We couldn't leave town of course because our older daughter wasn't
home And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana On Sunday 
morning when I went to see Ira home our neighbor said Zin' you know they 
went into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had They murdered his 
father and two sons Valodya is our neighbor he's an Armenian he lives on 
the first floor I think my God what is happening And in broad daylight

I saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting Slay the
Armenians Karabagh is ours This was at  o'clock in the afternoon On the 
way I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says They beat our store
manager they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him but he was an 
Azerbaijani And I asked Did they kill him She says No he's in serious
condition I left there and started to walk home on that same street but the
mob started moving in my direction I turned off the street and went down the 
little way that goes toward the Sputnik store There I met another crowd but 
these weren't bandits these were our people from Sumgait I was so frightened
that I walked without knowing where was going I couldn't feel my legs or the 
ground under my feet I was walking and there was a boy standing before my 
eyes This was on the th around evening time He ran under our balcony and
the mob surged toward him shouting He's an Armenian get him He wore a 
black coat They grabbed him that boy near the bus stop I saw it They 
grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt

I made it home but I just couldn't calm down My oldest daughter was in my 
thoughts I was thinking my daughter's coming home now they'll stop her bus 
and she'll be gone There's no police no protection nothing It's like they 
had all died there's no one nothing no authorities whatsoever I can't even
find the words for it I look and see an Ikarus arriving Before going to the 
bus station they stop near our place across from the Kosmos movie theater So
this Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling the Azerbaijanis are running
toward it yelling Armenians out And I see them take the Armenians and beat
them killing them I can't watch it any more It was a nightmare I just 
couldn't watch it But Gaya was standing there watching it and I scolded her
She says Mamma I have to see it I have to know what's happening I have to
see it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later So our children 
will know

Gayane We saw a great deal on the th They caught no less than  people
before my eyes I can't say for sure if they killed them or not   

Zinaida There were too many people there the mob was too big You couldn't 
make anything out But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes He
was  or  years old

Gayane I think he was older probably about  A tall fellow a big guy 
in a coat He was walking quickly but when they shouted that he was an
Armenian he tore off running And the mob went after him They caught him 
right under our balcony I don't know I don't think there could have been 
much left of him after that You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks
one person It was a mob big angry and featureless You know there was a 
similarity in the way they were dressed mostly they were wearing long black 
coats You couldn't even tell them apart they were all wearing black and they
all looked alike

Zinaida When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and 
he cried Mamma I ran into the room I couldn't watch any longer An awful 
lot was going on right then in various places it wasn't only that boy 
several people were being beaten up You couldn't see all of it at once but 
when that boy cried Mamma I immediately started watching only him

Gayane On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until
twelve at night At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place
They were scattered about in all districts But how can you explain the fact
that by morning when it had already started getting light around seven
o'clock our police were gone The police disappeared and yielded their
positions to the bandits In the morning they started gathering at our inter
section again at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown From
morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered and by nine
o'clock you couldn't even see the ground There were thousands of people in
the crowd Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians

Zinaida They had signals I realized that when I noticed that they made a 
cross with their arms they crossed their arms over their heads The cross
evidently meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it They let the
Azerbaijani cars through and they stopped the Armenian ones and started
their pogrom

Gayane They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his 
nationality was He got out and said they were from Baku But what is your
nationality He says Armenian They immediately start shouting Ermeni
Ermeni And he says What's going on I'm coming from Baku I don't live
in Sumgait Doesn't matter who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait
Anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him and they dragged a 
womanhis wife probablyout of the car At this point the police came and 
took the two and led them away Then the mob started smashing the car and 
then burned it The flames blazed    it was a horrible fire Then everyone 
ran away they thought the car was going to explode About  minutes later 
another car comes along a green Moskvich They ran up shouting Ermeni 
Ermeni But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car they didn't
beat them Maybe they burned them along with the car because no one emerged 
from the flames The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too 
acquaintances of his walked by below and he asked them and they said Yes 
they burned them along with the car About two hours later a whole wedding 
procession came by and there was a doll on the first car We thought they 
were Armenians but the cars started to honk loudly They were Azerbaijanis 
and they were immediately allowed through

Zinaida The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way' The
whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely

Gayane By the way at the marriage hall which is right in the courtyard
of our building there was a wedding that day The Azerbaijanis were cele
brating and dancing On the streets there was grief and death people were
being killed and people were celebrating the whole time

Zinaida Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and 
find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive She went to her 
girlfriend's in the building she lives in the first entryway on the third 
floor Gaya came back and said Mamma the bus is supposed to come around
eight after eight You can imagine what I was feeling how hard it was
Vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death 
Then I heard shouting I raced to the window and see that the belongings of 
our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors They were 
thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow I 
started to cry I am walking around the room crying wailing Vika's not 
here what will come of her    Gaya of course was consoling me Mamma 
nothing will happen to her don't worry calm down she's in good company 
they'll look out for her

Diana I saw the green car burn The car was burning when we went out onto the
balcony Gaya pushed me away telling me to get off the balcony I left Then 
they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here

Zinaida You're right I forgot about that that was on the th

Diana There's a small grassy area in front of our balcony there are trees
planted there The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building
All the neighbors said no there are no Armenians here There weren't a lot
of Armenians in our building but there weren't just a few Armenian families 
either

Gayane They fell upon the apartments on the th There were terribly many 
of them Our courtyard is huge and it was completely filled with them

Zinaida Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier He said that 
two people Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabagh And when he said that 
   you know how bees sound have you heard how they buzz It was like the 
buzzing of millions of bees    and with this buzzing they flew into our 
courtyard howling and shouting I don't know how to describe it By this 
point we were afraid to watch from the balcony but when I looked out of the 
bedroom windowthe Znaniye Bookstore is down there and Armenians live on the 
second and fourth floorsI saw their things being thrown out the windows I 
realized that they would be upon us any minute I shouted to Gayane Gaya 
hide the gold That's honestly what I told my child I grabbed Diana I 
didn't know what to do Vika still wasn't home and it was already getting 
dark I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it 
was

Gayane Just in case we changed the television channel from the Moscow 
station to the Azerbaijani one

Zinaida And turned it up loud

Gayane We never listened to Azerbaijani music It just didn't do much for 
us In all those years we almost never listened to it But sometimes we would
watch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television And that was 
it And here we had it turned up full blast So they would think we were 
Azerbaijanis

Zinaida Well you can imagine they're slaughtering Armenians robbing them 
and we're listening to this concert music from Baku Our Azerbaijani neighbors
suggested we do it they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on 
Azerbaijani music But we already had it on anyway Turn on the lights they 
told us so they will think you're not Armenians They're saying the Armenians
are afraid to turn on their lights they're hiding

Gayane Apparently there was some kind of arrangement because we noticed 
that the lights were off only in Armenian apartments that is the 
Azerbaijanis were warned and every last one of them had their lights on
When we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately and
later another one Turn on the lights they told us please Nothing will
happen Be calm Nothing will happen

Zinaida We won't allow them to come into your apartment

Gayane We believed those people We had never done anything bad to them

  Zinaida After the whole nightmare about March  before we left for
Armenia when I was coming into the building they were all crying The
Azerbaijanis were crying saying Can it be there is no God How could
they raise their hands against your family You never did anyone any harm
you never refused anyone anything not in hard times or in time of fortune
or in time of mourning How could they give you away How could they sell you 
down the river They really had given us away Some of them protected us but
others gave us away They sold us down the river

Gayane I was wearing slacks that day and when it all began I became 
cautious for some reason and I changed my clothes Azerbaijani women don't 
wear pants Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants but the 
Azerbaijanis found that very strange And I thought I better put on a skirt 
otherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis There was
nothing else we could do No other way out I was forced to turn myself into 
God knows who I let my hair down tousled it and threw a scarf over my head

Zinaida And she told me Mamma you hide Take Diana and go into the other 
room You two look more like Armenians They'll figure out that we're 
Armenians right away But how could I go away and leave her there

Gayane I went out onto the balcony It worked out better that way We were 
the only Armenian family in the fourth entryway This gave us hope we were 
the only ones the neighbors wouldn't let them in They the Azerbaijanis 
would fear for themselves and for their children I looked and saw someone 
crawling up on the balcony from below it was easy to get up onto our balcony
When we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and 
we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way So I turned around
and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony He looks at me and shouts What 
nationality are you here

Zinaida At the same time they were knocking on the door

Gayane What nationality are you he's shouting Well at first I was
frightened but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect 
Azerbaijani You should be ashamed of yourself asking a question like that
Can't you see I'm an Azerbaijani If I were an Armenian would I come out to 
meet you face to face and look you in the eyes He looks at me and tells the
people with him Yes Azerbaijanis live here From below they tell him
Check it out it can't be they have to be Armenians And he asks me again
What nationality are you I say Can't you see I started fuming I could
not say anything else You're blind that's for sure You can yell all you
want but that won't make us Armenians I hear them breaking down our
door and Mamma went toward the door I say I don't have time to deal
with you they're breaking down our door  go to the door and ask Who is
it They answer Open up I say Wait why are you breaking the door
What's going on I'm opening up We never locked the lower lock it was
broken but now they had locked it out of fear and I couldn't get it open I
say wait I'm looking for the key I opened the doorit was almost broken
down already I opened the door and they burst in I say What's going on
Why are you breaking down our door

Zinaida Then they started climbing in from the balcony They're shouting 
Why don't you open the door And I say Well you've already come in the 
balcony Then Diana sees their knives runs into the bathroom and closes the
door Gaya cries out Mamma Diana ran into the bathroom I ran to the door 
and forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis and said in Armenian 
Diana open the door Gaya tried to calm them down and I'm shouting with
tears in my eyes for Diana to open the door

Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll Little Red Riding Hood That 
guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle They 
put it up to Mamma's stomach I ran to the bathroom opened the door and 
slammed it behind me I was frightened and started to cry I shouted Mamma
they want to kill you And then    then they started shouting Give us 
your passports And Gaya says What do you need passports for we're 
Azerbaijanis

Gayane I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis I was trying
everything I could I could get on my knees and plead I could humble myself 
because at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own To be
honest I didn't care about anything else as long as my little sister would 
survive her life and health had cost us so dearly I tell them What don't 
you understand anything They started shouting they were tremendously 
excited shouting with terribly loud voices saying that in Stepanakert their 
girls were being killed raped and tossed around with pitchforks Why 
shouldn't they do the same to us I said Who's doing all that Who is doing 
it Some Armenians What does that have to do with us Give me the knife I'll
cut my own face Now you calm down they tell me

Zinaida I told them Why didn't you deal with them there There in 
Karabakh Nothing has happened here no one has been fighting here not we 
with the Armenians nor they with us Why didn't you give it right back to
them there What've we got to do with this I got confused I had been
saying that we were Azerbaijanis but suddenly I started speaking as though
I were an Armenian but they didn't notice One of them was next to me
with a knife at my breast And he says to the others What pretty girls He
meant Gaya and my yearold Diana I was terrified Gaya started assuring 
them that we were Azerbaijanis One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad 
looks

Gayane He demanded the passports I said Young man I don't have my 
passport here He says Let's have the passport we won't believe you
without your passport And one of them started hurriedly searching for
documents They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down took the 
picture off the wall and started pulling the clothes off their hooks yelling
and shouting Passport Passport They all started yelling there was so 
much noise in the apartment They were all shouting My hair stood on end 
Suddenly I said Listen my Papa died  days haven't passed yet we have a 
Muslim household we're in mourning you should be ashamed of yourselves 
you've disgraced your honor And then Mamma started to cry

Zinaida I started crying My husband died  days haven't yet passed
aren't you ashamed of yourselves In fact my husband had died seven years
earlier in  We're in mourning and you burst in here demanding docu
ments The documents are at the housing office I'm filing for my pension
Well it seemed like they believed us Then one guy said They're Lezgins
Can't you see there are no men here only women Leave Another fellow in
the group agreed with him he also said that we were Lezgins But a third
said No they're Armenians Well the other two convinced him I don t know 
how and all the rest of them listened to them too There were about  of 
them if not more all in our threeroom apartment even the entryway was 
filled They started leaving Yes we're Lezgins we're Lezgins They started
leaving and one of them took our tape recorder with him And the one who had 
first called us Lezgins says Leave that what are you doing They seemed to
obey that guy

Gayane He was tall wearing baggy jeans and a coat

Zinaida With a little moustache I think

Gayane No he didn't have a moustache he was tall with brown hair he 
wasn't a badlooking sort He didn't have anything in his hands

Zinaida He stood at the threshold

Gayane Yes he didn't look like a bad guy and you know his face seemed 
familiar to me I had seen him somewhere And more than once But I can't 
remember where When he came in I was stupefied I had a premonition that he 
wouldn't be able to remain indifferent When he said that we were Lezgins and 
that they should leave such gladness started to glow inside of me Hope They
continued to argue on their way out Some said They're Armenians all the 
same And that fellow answered even if they are Armenians it's shameful
the father died they're mourning there's nothing but women in the house 
there's no men We should stay out of the apartment What do you mean stay 
out We can go in there And he said No we should stay out they're 
Lezgins we're leaving here The three of them protected us

   Zinaida No the two of them The one in the short coat and the one in the
grey suit who stood at the threshold about  or  years old Well they
were all young really The two of them defended us

Diana Three three

Zinaida Do you remember the third one Diana

Diana Yes he was wearing dark clothes

Gayane The third one was the one who came back He wore a long brown coat

Diana He wore a long darkish brown coat and his hair was dark too When 
they left they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians and ran 
back and said that they were going to kill us

Zinaida They had all left and we had started to calm down a little and I
closed the door And then there is a knock I told Gaya Take Diana and go
into the other room My daughters went into the dining room and I opened the
door There was a guy there who said Run hide They're coming to kill you 
now We ran up to the third floor We had some good neighbors up there
Azerbaijanis I sent the kids and stood there alone not knowing what to do 
I was so far gone    Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything 
to take I even forgot to take my work documents at the time I had been 
preparing a report to send to Baku and the documents were at home I couldn't
see anything    I could only see Vika my older daughter I sent Gaya and 
Diana upstairs and stood there asking that fellow Should I close the door 
and leave everything like this He says What do you mean door Get out of 
here they're coming to kill you What are you standing there for And I ran 
after the children

Gayane We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into 
our apartment and started shouting Where are the Armenians We were already
at the neighbors' They had an infant at the time and the neighbor said 
Don't you worry I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what

Zinaida On the third floor there I started asking the folks our neighbors
to go meet Vika The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock I dissolved in
tears Gaya was soothing me Diana was next to us she was crying too and I'm
already thinking that I've lost my older daughter but deep in my heart I 
still believe she's alive    And my tears choked me I was going out of my
mind But no one could leave the building the courtyard was packed with
people swarming with them From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment 
we were hiding asked the bandits Where are those Armenians the ones who 
were at home Where did they make off to They told him they didn't know 
They asked him where he lived He answered Can't you see on the third 
floor He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment We
heard them taking free reign of our apartment and they threw our color 
television off the balcony and it exploded

Gayane Mamma was crying the whole time She fell into a faint and we brought
her around and held her back because the whole time she kept making for the 
door to go outside alternately raving and sobbing shouting and calling 
Vika She didn't notice us probably because we were next to her Her thoughts
were only on Vika The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too 
offering tea

Zinaida We are very grateful to them Thanks to them my children and I are
alive well and unharmed When they were throwing our belongings out and 
burning themthe beds the pillows and the chairsour neighbor came to us 
and said How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked but some 
other woman instead You're from our part of the building you lost your 
husband you have children thank God you're not in her position we wouldn't 
have been able to take it I don't know what I would do He of course 
wouldn't have done anything he was just trying to calm us down In the yard 
they were torturing our neighbors fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth 
floor in the third entryway A married couple Vanya and Nina and their 
three children Their last name is V They hid their two daughters and stayed
with their son to defend themselves they even got boiling water ready and an
axe and held them off for a long time but the    They beat up the 
husband dragged the wife outside and stood her naked next to our burning 
things her husband was lying at her feet on the ground The crowd shouted 
Look at the naked Armenian They were going to throw the poor woman into the
fire The neighbors came out an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf and she 
covered herself with it and the neighbors led her off to their apartment 
All the neighbors saw and heard it   

Gayane Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing
there and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them 
into her body Our neighbor who lived in the same entryway as Ninashe 
lives with us in the same boarding house nowsaw what they had done Nina 
showed her from her knees up almost up to her neck her whole body was 
covered riddled with wounds

Zinaida In the morning during the night of the th rather after one
o'clock two buses approached the station I wanted to run out By then I
didn't care any more if I lived or died but Gayane wouldn't let me go and
the neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be
slain along with their children Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about
them my other children but I could only think of Vika I imagined her torn
to pieces I'm a mother and they're just children they don't understand I
would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help I was
going to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me Mamma please Mamma I beg of 
you The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries So we 
held on that way till morning

On the morning of the th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to
our apartment maybe Vika was lying there murdered He told me he would go 
himself He was gone for about five minutes but it seemed like an eternity to
me He returned and said there was no one there nothing I went down too 
stole down like a mouse and slipped in everything was thrown all about I 
didn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far 
away farther than the bus station I began looking for the briefcase with my 
work in it I was miserable because of my daughter and at the same time 
because of my work My documents were there my travel papersI worked in the
transport division  and my trip sheets

Gayane Mamma is a very responsible person she was always ready to work 
around the clock to do her job

Zinaida I look around and I can't find the briefcase I didn't care about 
the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms that
everything was smashed and the furniture was broken I worried about that
later but at first I was concerned about the lost documents I went into the
kitchen My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove my ring and 
my earrings It was all there Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said
Mamma hurry And Diana came downstairs too Gayane found  her coat among 
the debris and Diana found her track shoes her coat and some of her 
dresses

Diana Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started 
throwing things around in the apartment under us They threw a television onto
the asphalt it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap Then 
when Vika wasn't there I wouldn't eat and they forced me but I couldn't 
eat Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies
and gone for walks in the park When we went into our apartment the next day 
and everything was broken right away I started looking for my dolls and my 
books but I didn't see anything When we went back upstairs I managed to take
two cups from my tea service and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own 
dresses My Italian boots were gone my brown coat it was beautiful there 
wasn't a one of my beautiful dolls and my giant lion was gone too the one 
that had been on top of the television He was very large and very handsome 
I had two satchels one for first grade and the other for second grade one 
was yellowgreen with a boy and a girl on it they're playing a drum and a 
violin and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears and on the other 
one were the letters A B C D E and the numbers  two girls and a boy 
with their mouths open like they are singing They were beautiful satchels 
They were gone too I had many books I collected them they were in the 
bedside tables And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my 
birthday they weren't around either And I had some big books fat ones and 
they disappeared only one was left The Malachite Box The Adventures of 
Karlson Pippi Longstockings and Fairy Tales of the World were left All the 
other books were gone

Zinaida I continued searching for my briefcase and then my supervisor
arrived He had waited for me until nine o'clock but I didn't appear and he
thought something must have happened so he came He's a Russian Aleksei 
Semyonovich Lomakin Alik Aliyev the mechanic came with him When they saw 
my wrecked apartment they were just petrified they could not say a thing 
When I saw them I started crying My Azerbaijani neighbors came in Some of 
them were crying others were helping me pick up I go on looking for my 
documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe Now that I 
remember it it's both funny and painful How could I have thought that I had 
returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal 
Incidentally later when I went back to the apartment again those things were
gone too And the door was gone After my supervisor left in the afternoon 
the neighbor said that we should leave find another refuge I'm afraid he 
said that someone saw you come to my apartment and that they could kill you
and us too My God where could I go it was daytime and those    I don't 
even know what to call them the bandits those marauders those jackals I 
don't know what to call them I can't find the words they were everywhere 
Where should I go with two girls When I opened the door I had tears in my 
eyes and I was terrified    And he said Go to Alik's he's an
Azerbaijani too and I say You should have said that earlier when my 
supervisor was here with the car he could have taken us with him Everyone 
feared for their own lives What could I do I went out into the entryway and 
stood And he says any other time I would keep you here a year or two But 
right now I'm sorry     Then another door opened also on the third 
floor I ask the neighbor Tayara can we hide at your place She's an 
Azerbaijani too She says What kind of question is that Come in She hid 
us There were many people in the courtyard and Gaya and I hid in the 
wardrobe and they put Diana under a mattress leaving a small opening so the 
child could breathe Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us 
out and when they came back she would hide us again

We sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour Gaya became ill and I allowed 
her to get out My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons We hadn't eaten or 
drunk anything for so long since the th when we saw that horrorand all 
of it just snapped in me Tayara's husband went outside even though I begged 
him to stay saying there should be a man in the house He said that he'd be 
in the courtyard and if anything happened his wife would signal him She put 
her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came 
in she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family My girls went to 
the windowand what was going on out there I feared for my children that 
someone would recognize them from the street Gaya let her hair down and put 
on a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani but directly across there was
a story building their windows were right across from us and I shouted 
that someone would see her and give us away on the spot But she kept on 
looking

Diana I watched too

Zinaida Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers The soldiers
didn't shoot they didn't have orders to I saw them throwing rocks at
the soldiers they were young boys  and year olds and they defended
themselves    I'm a mother after all and they were no different from my
children When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to
stop looking l couldn't watch anymore    I imagined my children in their
shoes   

Gayane The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned 
off the buildings and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station Block 
 and our Microdistrict  But they only cordoned them off from the outside
The mob fell upon the soldiers who started to protect themselves and the mob
surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it They caught several 
Azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs One fell down and they
cracked open another's head   

Zinaida They show Lebanon on television and the war in Afghanistanthat's just
what it was like Like in America how they attack demonstrations with shields
and clubsthat's just how it was in our courtyard

Gayane Don't compare it with America those were peaceful demonstrations 
but these

Zinaida But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America They 
attacked the soldiers hurled stones at them    Then I thought where's the
tear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators If they had used 
gas on those jackals they all would have scattered

Gayane They would not have scattered The soldiers had been there since 
morning they didn't bring in fresh troops They hadn't eaten they were fine 
standing there for about three hours but then they got tired They weren't 
even allowed to sit down    At noon they the soldiers attacked them and 
then the tables were turned The mob went after the soldiers the guys were 
bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their 
shields and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them
And those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields And meanwhile
tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets    They always say Our 
children have never seen war I never even dreamed about it there was no 
need to But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war It
was truly horrible    The guys were tired exhausted some had had their 
clubs taken away others their shields they had been beaten they were 
covered in blood    so many died They beat the soldiers with their own 
clubs and shields And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves 
they couldn't open fire They couldn't even defend themselves let alone us 
It's comical   

Zinaida What are you saying How can it be funny

Gayane No I didn't mean that How could something like that happen during 
our Soviet period It's painfully embarrassing And they burned the armored 
personnel carriers too Someone shouted Get away it's going to blow 
Everyone scattered away and the armored personnel carrier exploded The 
soldiers lost their senses And when they drove the personnel carrier and the 
bus at the mob out of rage and fury they drove right up on the sidewalk

Zinaida The bus that had brought the troops Only the driver was in it The 
bus ran over three people straight off I saw it And two armored personnel 
carriers ran over four more All in one or two minutes The bus ran over 
three one of the carriers ran over two and the second two more Right on 
our street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places one 
of the armored personnel carriers went that way and they say it ran over
several over there too But they ran over seven before our eyes Then the bus
ploughed into a book kiosk

Gayane No that was a flower place It was a new booth He drove straight 
into it

Zinaida The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the
middle of the road and set it on fire

Gayane And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and 
take them in a convoy to Baku There were many arrests

Zinaida Our neighbor the one who hid us couldn't take it and he told his 
wife that we should leave They were running around in the courtyard looking 
for the Armenians They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis and they
were saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families Poor 
Tayara got scared too and started to cry I pleaded with her I said that I 
would remember forever how she saved my children and me but where could we 
go

Gayane She didn't make us leave she said that she would do anything but 
she was afraid

Zinaida I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at
night we would return to our apartment Then her husband came back and said 
that a curfew had been imposed He says Zina you owe us a drink Gorbachev 
announced a curfew And Bagirov First Secretary of the Communist Party of 
Azerbaijan SSR was on television he said that two people had been killed in 
Karabagh but nothing was wrong automobile windows had been broken but there
hadn't been any killings He kept making statements and there were 
Azerbaijani songs and dances Tayara turned the TV all the way up When we 
learned of the curfew we calmed down but then a crowd ran into the courtyard 
again a large one Our neighbor told them that there had been only one 
Armenian family here but they had already killed them all there was no one 
left We hid in the wardrobe again and they stuck Diana back under the bed

Gayane Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there and
found two bandits They asked her What are you doing here Tayara answered 
I came to take something for myself Take all you want they're gone now 

Zinaida Yes she had wanted to get something for us at least some bedding 
She said What are you going to do empty handed naked with three children
nothing remains of your entire apartment In short we calmed down and the 
crowd raced off to the other building the one across from us I don't know 
what went on there

Gayane The curfew had its effect on the gangs many started to disperse
they were warned that they would open fire on them The soldiers didn't know 
the city they couldn't get oriented they drove up and down the main streets
but didn't go into the courtyards When we were at the City Party Committee 
they asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way

Zinaida The tanks entered the city on the night of the th

Gayane No Mamma the tanks had been there earlier but were near the City 
Party Committee where the Armenians were    After midnight on March  
when I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights Mamma said 
Get your things together they have sent buses for us As it was we had been
dressed the entire time Mamma went to check it out   and came back for us

Zinaida When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive 
and well some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe 
place I both believed it and didn't believe it We ran out to the tanks The 
Gambarians were there Roman and Sasha their father Shurik the clarinetist
was killed and their mother was there Sasha came over and asked about the 
girls I was surprised how did he know my girls He said that he knew me and 
the girls Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he 
was taking forever so I went after him Another neighbor came out Anna 
Vasilyevna a Russian Zinochka my dear goodbye and good luck She kissed 
Diana They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be 
taken to the City Party Committee The bus wouldn't start so they put us on 
another one It was pouring rain

Diana When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets 
and they all had clubs and shields And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them 
many of the soldiers died They threw paving stoneshuge rocksat the 
soldiers I saw this myself The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the
tanks The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people 
and they ran over them out of rage We got scared and they hid me under a 
mattress and a blanket and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe And they
were fighting right down there on the street    Near the building they were
blowing up buses and tanks and cars were burning and there were many dead in
the courtyard They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a 
street they just drove and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way 
were run over by the tanks And when we leftit was evening it was already 
darkthere were three buses and one of them had soldiers in it Mamma ran up
and said Get your clothes on let's go Gaya was wearing slippers and I 
had on my blue dress but it was an old one I was wearing my old jacket my 
old dress and slippers And nothing else Gaya had on a skirt her Angora 
sweater and slippers It was raining hard and there were puddles on the 
street They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a shortsleeved 
dress she put it on and we ran out We got onto the bus and I was hungry one
of the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to
the other in his arms I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika's
trousseau and he gave me his telephone number

Gayane In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window
We had to be ready for anything They took us to the City Party Committee let
us out and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed 
guard It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe We asked Are 
these all us Armenians They answered yes We were surprised that there were
so many Armenians in Sumgait All those years we lived there and didn't know 
there were so many Armenians  We were struck by that we had never 
noticed Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the 
Komsomol from Vika's plant the Khimprom He said that Vika was alive and 
well When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more But you know 
after all that it was hard to believe anything our faith in everything was 
just gone She didn't believe it completely

Zinaida I didn't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things When
we arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable It
was the fear of God I saw many of our acquaintances they were kissing each 
other and asking how their children and homes were Many people already knew 
that there had been a pogrom of our apartment They had seen the broken 
windows I cried saying that I didn't know where Vika was One woman said 
that they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of 
them the other had been slashed all over A second said that her husband and
her son had been murdered That was Nelli Aramian She lived in Building  in 
our microdistrict They killed her husband Armo and her son Artur I heard 
so many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch my 
patience had run dry waiting for my daughter Later an Azerbaijani fellow came
to me and said Aunt Zina Vika sent me she's alive and well and hidden in a 
safe place if you want I'll call her there and you can speak with her We 
went downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika I spoke with her heard
the voice of my child She had managed to survive in that hell Then I started
begging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee He tried to
talk me out of it I'll bring her wherever you go don't worry I've looked 
after her better than a brother does a sister All the same I asked him to 
get her He brought her and I calmed down On the second day there was a 
meeting with Demichev Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of the USSR and people started shouting One shouted Give 
me my son back another yelled Where is my daughter a third wanted her
husband    Bagirov  was there too and he stood there blinking not saying 
anything

Gayane When Demichev asked where we wanted to go everyone shouted To
Russia To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia there were such wild 
rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream and no one wanted to go 
to Armenia But he said that he couldn't evacuate  people to Russia and 
that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with 
them And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our 
apartments On March  we went to the military barracks in the village of 
Nasosny We were taken care of marvelously by the military They sent special 
flights of children right from there to Minvody Yerevan and Moscow One

Zinaida The worst was truly behind us by then Everything had passed but 
the pain will remain for our whole lives It cannot be forgotten Under no 
circumstances should we our children or our grandchildren forget Who will
answer for those who died For our mothers sisters brother sons and
daughters Who will bear the responsibility Who will wash away their blood 
Someone should be made to answer and severely so it has an effect on the 
people that did with us as they pleased    It isn't over yet now we live 
here in Armenia protected but the issue isn't resolved We would like
to stay in Armenia in our homeland so that all the Armenian people will be
united Then we will be invincible Armenians won't be scattered throughout 
the Soviet Union about the world and if we're all together this won't happen
again As a mother of three children as a woman as a sister I ask Armenians
to be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again Our 
homeland    The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an 
apartment and getting jobs So that our children can work for the good of 
Armenia If we aren't able to then let our children do it And if it's 
possible we'll work for the good of Armenia too This is the land of our 
forefathers Our grandfathers and greatgrandfathers lived here too it was 
only later that people dispersed all over Like a mother the land here bore 
and reared us It is our wife and will protect us too I want but one thing
that our people never see the hardship that our children saw that your 
children here in Armenia never see anything like it

So Mr Salah is still claiming Stalin was a Jew 

This thread began on SCA when he and another guy claimed both Stalin
and Lenin were Jews When I posted evidence from books and the Britannica
showing they were Christians someone made the correct remark that
Lenin's maternal grandfather was a Jew who converted to Christianity

To counter the fact that Stalin was a Christian who during his youth
was trained to be a priest Mr Salah wrote yes it says he was trained
to be a priest but not for what religion BTW Stalin developed
strong antisemitic feelings later in his life

Mr Salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against Jews by posting
antisemitic forgeries and trying to prove that certain notorious
people were Jews even if they were not

The Golan Heights is a serious security problem and Israel obviously
will have to keep part of it and give up part of it  One should
remember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was to
be in Britain's Palestine Mandate slated to become part of the Jewish
state until Britain traded it to France for other considerations  In
other words it is an historical accident that it was ever part of
Syria

	The Palestine mandate had no borders before
the borders were negotiated and drawn  The most the Golan may have been
is on the list of what territories Britian would have liked to
see in the palestine mandate
	Until the mandates came into existance there were no defined
boundaries between any of the various territories in the region

	If you have a source for any of these claims then please
present it

In article APRVMMCGILLCA BHA BHAMUSICBMCGILLCA writes

 Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary

	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave Lebanon when
the Lebanese government can provide guarantees that Israel will not be
attacked from Lebanese soil and when the Syrians leave

Not acceptable Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if
they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion
where they were both part of the same mandate territory  read
colony

Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon Invading another
country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost
all wars of aggression have started


 Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank Gaza and Golan
temporary

	The three are very different issues  Israel has stated
repeatedly that it will not give up the whole Golan but may be
willing to give part of it to Syria as part of a peace agreement

Again territorial expansion by force


	Israel has already annexed areas taken over in the  war
These areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no
legitamate governing body  Citizenship was given to those residents
in annexed areas who wanted citizenship

The UN defines them as occupied They are recognised as such by every
nation on earth excluding one small caribean island


	Israel should keep control of parts of the West Bank IMHO
The parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge
which contain few arab towns and many suburbs as well as overlooking
the city of Tel Aviv  The Eastern mountain ridge should be
abandonded  This is where most of the arabs live and it is less
militarily relevant  Israel should also maintain a presence in the
Jordan valley

So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and 
a continued military presence That is a completely unsustainable situation
because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the
Israeli ecconomy any more There is no money for such an occupation


If so for those of you who support it why were so
many settlers moved into the territories  If it is not temporary
let's hear it

	There are a number of reasons for people to move they were
not moved but chose to move into disputed areas  Note that since
these moves were made by free willed human beings not settlers I
will address two aspects of your question why the government would
allow or encourage them to move and second why they did move

They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return
of the occupied territories Machiavelli described the reasoning in the
Prince The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud
beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous
population

The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the 
redefinition of much land used in common as public land The assertion
that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to
an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an
excuse When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought
in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the
Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories
must not be changed 

No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists
will change the fact that the majority of world governments and all of
those that actually have any power have condemned this practice


	The government had a number of reasons for encouraging people
to move across the green line  They included security and politics

	The first reason was security  A large Jewish presense makes
it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate  A Jewish settlements also
act as fortresses in times of war

Theyu also are a liability We are talking about civilian encampments that
would last no more than hours against tanks

	A second reason was political  Creating settlements brought
the arabs to the negotiation table  Had the creation of new towns and
cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in
Israel where there was an arab majority  There would have been no
land left that could be called arab

Don't fool yourself It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the
negotiating table Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else

If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have
cut the money supply

	The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place
changes the face of any peace settlement and restricts what land can
be given away

Not at all They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel

	Some of the communites created were religious  They built
their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of
the 's and 's  There are communities like this in Hebron Gaza
and all over  There are also communities built near religious sites

The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country
to annexe territory not in Bosnia not in the West Bank

	The point is there are many reasons people moved over the
green line and many reasons the government wanted them to  Whatever
status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all
or nothing deal  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not
be the results of a war

Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of  there will be no peace
Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else


The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty Since the
Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it
is this that will be the guarantor of peace another factor will be the
return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the
dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against
nonJews within what is nominaly a secular state 

The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has
a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the
Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position This will mean
outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying
or using much of the land

   I have read numerous posts over a period of several months by
this antiIsrael fanatic hiding in the shadow of the respectable
sounding name of the 'Center for Policy Research'  Obviously it
is no research center of any kind unless 'researching' published
documents to find material to use against Israel makes it so  

   Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising
in itself  That is simply part of the propaganda process  I was
curious if anyone knew who this antiIsrael fanatic hiding behind
his phoney 'research center' name is  Is he an Arab  Is he some
typical antisemite hiding behind a veneer of 'antizionism'  Is
he some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldn't make it
there and is now taking his failure out on Israel  

   Let's shed some light on this clown once and for all  It will
help put his nonsense in the proper perspective  And the readers
of this group who are more interested in fact than in antiIsrael
hyperbola can ignore this junk

                  THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS
  
 
 Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip 
 during the threeweeklong closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the 
 Jewish state Palestinian sources said on Sunday
 
 The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of
 the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of housetohouse raids for
 Palestinian activists during the closure which was imposed on the strip and
 occupied West Bank
 
 Five days ago girls at the AlKhansaa secondary said a group of naked
 soldiers taunted them yelling Come and kiss me'' When the girls fled 
 the soldiers threw empty bottles at them
     
 On Saturday a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their
 pants when they saw girls from AlKhansaa walking home from school Parents 
 are considering keeping their daughters home from the allgirls school
     
 The same day soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth
 escaped from them at a boys' secondary school Deputy Principal Srur 
 AbuJamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls backed them 
 against a wall and put their arms around them
 
 When teacher Hamdan AbuHajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat
 him with the butts of their rifles
 
 On Tuesday troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh a practising
 Moslem and demanded he kiss his female passenger Qdieh refused the 
 soldiers hit him and the yearold passenger kissed him to stop the 
 beating
 
 On Friday soldiers entered the home of Zamno AbuEalyan  blindfolded
 him and his wife put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance As
 the elderly couple danced the soldiers slipped away The coupled continued
 dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening
 
     The army said it was checking the reports
 
                
 
 
      ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM
 
 Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday 
 to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper
     
 Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some  worshippers in
 prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after
 soldiers told them only people with armyissued permits could enter
 
     Right now our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy
 Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer'' said Father
 George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish
 
     Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of
 Palestinian attacks against Jews The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank
 and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem their economic spiritual and cultural centre
 
    Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation
 of requesting permits to reach holy sites
 
     Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory allowing Jews free movement
 to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian
 celebrations
 
     Yesterday we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption
 But we cannot reach our holiest sites'' he said
 
     An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech demanding to see his
 identity card before ordering the crowd to leave

 While I applaud investing of money in Yehuda Shomron v'ChevelAzza
 in order to create jobs for their residents I find it deplorable that
 this has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration
 since  with regard to their Jewish residents Past governments
 found funds to subsidize cheap read affordable housing and the
 requisite infrastructure but where was the investment for creating
 industry which would have generated income and jobs 

The investment was there in the form of huge tax breaks and employer
benfits  You are overlooking the difference that these could have
made to any company  Part of the problem was that few industries
were interested in political settling as much as profit

 After  years Yehuda and Shomron remain barren bereft of even 
 middlesized industries and the Jewish settlements are sterile
 bedroom communities havens for in the main Israelis both
 secular and religious who work in TelAviv or Jerusalem but
 cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs

True which leads to the obvious question should any investment have
been made there at the taxpayer's expense  Obviously the answer was
and still is a resounding no

 Just a couple of questions for the proIsraeli lobby out there
 
  Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary  For Mr
 Stein  I am working on a proof for you that Israel is diverting
 water to the Jordan River away from Lebanese territory

Yes it is as has been evidenced by the previous two stages
of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops
Currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light
and armored patrols  No permanent installations have been
built in the area nor are any planned

As to the prodigal water question  you can continue to waste
your time looking for nonexistent proof or you can accept the
testimony of people here some Lebanese who have acknowledged
that they know of no evidence for these allegations

  Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank Gaza and Golan
 temporary  If so for those of you who support it why were so
 many settlers moved into the territories  If it is not temporary
 let's hear it

It depends which of those territories you refer to
In general settlers were moved into the territories because
at the time in the context of the situations it seemed the
logical move  This is not to say that views don't change
or that mistakes are not made  Currently I would say that
the only disputed territory that does not appear to be temporary
is that of Eastern and northern Jerusalem

Don't fool yourself It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the
negotiating table Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else



Phill HallamBaker 

Oh why do you expose your ignorance  The US has been running on debt for 
the past four generations and has still financed what it pleases

And after the Gulf War Israel could do whatever it wanted after
not decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks  It was encouraged but
by no means forced to negotiate

Mr Baker to address all of your points would be impossible but in a 
nutshell it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in
Lebanon without attacking Syria  Syrian occupation has been hostile
and amounts to annexation  Israel's is clearly defensive  If it 
were not defensive you would see all of Lebanon occupied and governed by
Israel  But that is not what Israel wants

Subject Unconventional peace proposal


A unconventional proposal for peace in the MiddleEast
 by
			  Elias Davidsson

The following proposal is based on the following assumptions

      Fundamental human rights such as the right to life to
education to establish a family and have children to human
dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc are
more important to human existence that the rights of states

      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and
rights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail

      Between the collectivities defining themselves as
JewishIsraeli and PalestinianArab however labelled an
unresolved conflict exists

      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of
people It moreover poisons relations between communities peoples
and nations

      Each year the United States expends billions of dollars
in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties

      Attempts to solve the IsraeliArab conflict by traditional
political means have failed

      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two
distinct ethnicalreligious communitiespeoples which claim the
land there is no just nor peaceful solution possible

      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake
of peace and justice When people love they share

Having stated my assumptions I will now state my proposal

      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants
for each child born to a couple where one partner is IsraeliJew
and the other PalestinianArab

      To be entitled for a grant a couple will have to prove
that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli
citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner
although born in areas under current Isreali control is not
entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return

      For the first child the grant will amount to  For
the second the third child  for each child For each
subsequent child the grant will amount to  for each child


      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which
have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the
IsraeliArab conflict including the US Government Jewish and
Christian organizations in the US  and a great number of
governments and international organizations

      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'
marriages in IsraelPalestine all of whom would have relatives on
'both sides' of the divide would make the conflict lose its
ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a
truly civil society The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of
people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the
MiddleEast in a graceful manner

Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced I will
attempt to identify some of these

      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected
forms of partnership and marriage is not conventional However
it is based on the concept of affirmative action which is
recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the
perverse effects of segregation and discrimination International
law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at
reducing racial discrimination and segregation

      It may be objected that the IsraeliPalestinian conflict
is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict but that it is
a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous
colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed
struggle This objection is based on the assumption that the
'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice but
IsraeliJewish society and its members which will have to be
defeated This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill
the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental
human rights over collective rights see above

      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of
financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages' From their
point of view the continued existence of a specific Jewish People
overrides any other consideration be it human love peace of
human rights  The President of the World Jewish Congress Edgar
Bronfman reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he
gave to Der Spiegel a German magazine He called the increasing
assimilation of Jews in the world a calamity comparable in its
effects only with the Holocaust This objection has no merit
either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions see
above

      It may objected that only a few people in
IsraelPalestine would request such grants and that it would thus
not serve its purpose To this objection one might respond that
although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect
of such a proposal the existence of such a Fund would help mixed
couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and
encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist
attitudes

      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to
bring about substantial demographic changes This objection has
merits However it must be remembered that huge sums more than
 billion are expended each year by the United States government
and by US organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the
MiddleEast through armaments A mere fraction of these sums would
suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable
climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in
IsraelPalestine thus encouraging the emergence of a
nonsegregated society in that worntorn land

I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as
well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful
discussion and enrichment

I have not seen but I guess would not liked it  to me he 
represents the worst of both American and Israeli politics
 but this is a matter of taste

As for the famous confession it is currently believed at
least by some people that all this adultry affair was just
invented by him in order to impress the Likkud voters and poor
jealous Hamazah and appear as a real man

DEPOSITION OF ROMAN ALEKSANDROVICH GAMBARIAN

   Born 
   Senior Engineer
   Sumgait Automotive Transport Production Association

   Resident at Building B Apartment 
   Microdistrict No 
   Sumgait Azerbaijan


What happened in Sumgait was a great tragedy an awful tragedy for us the 
Armenian people and for all of mankind A genocide of Armenians took place
during peacetime

And it was a great tragedy for me personally because I lost my father in
those days He was still young Born in 

On that day February  we were at home Of course we had heard that there 
was unrest in town my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it But we 
didn't think    we thought that everything would happen outdoors that they
wouldn't go into people's apartments About five o'clock we saw a large crowd 
near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict We were sitting at home 
watching television We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir 
Street This is right near downtown next to the airline ticket office our 
house is right nearby That day there was a group of policeman with shields
there They threw rocks at those policemen Then they moved off in the 
direction of our building They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and 
started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building We switched off 
the light As it turns out their signal was just the opposite to turn on the
light That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home We of course didn't know 
and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment

Suddenly there's pounding on the door We go to the door all four of us
there were four of us in the apartment Father Mother my younger brother
Aleksandr and I He was born in  My father was a veteran of World War 
II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East he was a pilot

We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder breaking it down 
with axes We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani What's going on What's 
happened They say Armenians get out of here We don't open the door we 
say If we have to leave we'll leave we'll leave tomorrow They say No 
leave now get out of here Armenian dogs get out of here By now they've 
broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides We hold them off as best
we can my father and I on one side and my mother and brother on the other 
We had prepared ourselves we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment
and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves They broke in the door and
when the door gave way we held it for another halfhour No neighbors no
police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time We 
held the door They started to smash the door on the lock side first with an 
axe and then with a crowbar

When the door gave waythey tore it off its hingesSasha hit one of them 
with the axe The axe flew out of his hands They also had axes crowbars 
pipes and special rods made from armature shafts One of them hit my father 
in the head The pressure from the mob was immense When we retreated into the
room one of them hit my mother too in the left part of her face My brother
Sasha and I fought back of course Sasha is quite strong and hottempered he
was the judo champion of Sumgait We had hammers in our hands and we injured 
several of the banditsin the heads and in the eyes all that went on But 
they the injured ones fell back and others came to take their places there
were many of them

The door fell down at an angle The mob tried to remove the door so as to go 
into the second room and to continue    to finish us off Father brought 
skewers and gave them to Sasha and mewe flew at them when we saw Father 
bleeding his face was covered with blood he had been wounded in the head 
and his whole face was bloody We just threw ourselves on them when we saw 
that We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall drove
them down to the third floor We came out on the landing but a group of the 
bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in 
there having closed the door behind them We started tearing the door off to 
chase away the remaining ones or finish them Then a man an imposing man of 
about  an Azerbaijani came in When he was coming in Father fell down and
Mother flew to him and started to cry out I jumped out onto the balcony and 
started calling an ambulance but then the mob started throwing stones through
the windows of our veranda and kitchen We live on the fourth floor And no 
one came I went into the room It seemed to me that this man was the leader 
of the group He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a 
fur collar And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani What's with you 
woman why are you shouting What happened Why are you shouting like that
She says What do you mean what happened You killed somebody My father 
was a musician he played the clarinet he played at many weddings Armenian 
and Azerbaijani he played for many years Everyone knew him Mother says 
The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings he 
brought so much joy to people and you killed that person He says You 
don't need to shout stop shouting And when they heard the voice of this 
man the  to  people who were in the other room opened the door and 
started running out We chased after them but they ran away That man left 
too As we were later told downstairs one of them told the others I don't 
know if it was from fright or what told them that we had firearms even
though we only fought with hammers and an axe We raced to Father and started 
to massage his heart but it was already too late We asked the neighbors to 
call an ambulance The ambulance never came although we waited for it all 
evening and all through the night

Somewhere around midnight about  policemen came They informed us they were 
from Khachmas They said We heard that a group was here at your place you 
have our condolences They told us not to touch anything and left Father lay
in the room

So we stayed home Each of us took a hammer and a knife We sat at home Well
we say if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves Somewhere around 
one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy 
investigators They say Leave everything just how it is we're coming back 
here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything
Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too but no one helped us take 
Father away The morning came and the neighbors arrived We wanted to take 
Father away somehow We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times
but no one came We called an ambulance and nobody came Then one of the 
neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should 
hide We secured the door somehow or other We left Father in the room and 
went up to the neighbor's

The excesses began again in the morning The bandits came in several vehicles
ZIL panel trucks and threw themselves out of the vehicles like    a 
landing force near the center of town Our building was located right there A
crowd formed Then they started fighting with the soldiers Then in Buildings
 and  that's next to the airline ticket office they started breaking 
into Armenian apartments destroying property and stealing The Armenians 
weren't at home they had managed to flee and hide somewhere And again they 
poured in the direction of our building They were shouting that there were 
some Armenians left on the fourth floor meaning us They're up there still
up there Let's go kill them They broke up all the furniture remaining in 
the two rooms threw it outside and burned it in large fires We were hiding 
one floor up Something heavy fell Sasha threw himself toward the door 
shouting that it was probably Father they had thrown Father were defiling 
the corpse probably throwing it in the fire going to burn it I heard it 
and the sound was kind of hollow and I said No that's from some of the 
furniture Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow and calmed 
him down

The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock They smashed open the door and 
went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us They were also
Armenians they had left for another city

The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said Are you 
crazy Why are you hiding Armenians Don't you now they're checking all the 
apartments They could kill you and them And to us     Come on leave 
this apartment We went down to the third floor to some other neighbors' At
first the man didn't want to let us in but then one of his sons asked him and
he relented We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night We heard the sound
of motors The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers We went 
downstairs There was a light on in the room where we left Father In the 
other rooms as we found out later all the chandeliers had been torn down 
They left only one bulb The bulb was burning which probably was a signal 
they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our
Microdistrict  where there had been a pogrom

With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were 
saved Our salvationmy mother's my brother's and minewas purely 
accidental because as we later found out from the neighbors someone in the 
crowd shouted that we had firearms up there Well we fought but we were only
able to save Mother We couldn't save Father We inflicted many injuries on 
the bandits some of them serious But others came to take their places We 
were also wounded there was blood and we were scratched all overwe got our
share It was a miracle we survived We were saved by a miracle and the 
troops And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait the slaughter would have been 
even greater probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the 
genocide

Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the 
leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city and at their 
orders we were assigned special people to accompany us experts We went to '
pick up Father's corpse We took it to the morgue This was about two o'clock 
in the morning it was already March  it was raining very hard and it was 
quite cold and we were wearing only our suits When my brother and I carried 
Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses There were 
about six burned people in there and the small corpse of a burned child It 
was gruesome I suffered a tremendous shock There were about ten people 
there but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being
taken to Baku There was a woman's corpse there too she had been    well 
there was part of a body there    a hackedoff part of a woman's body It 
was something terrible The morgue was guarded by the landing force    The 
child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old It was impossible
to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned There was a 
man there too several men You couldn't tell anything because their faces 
were disfigured they were in such awful condition

Now two and a half months have passed Every day I recall with horror what 
happened in the city of Sumgait Every day my father and the death of my 
father and how we fought and the people's sorrow and especially the morgue

I still want to say that  years have passed since Soviet power was
established and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what 
happened  in Sumgait It will go down in history

I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops They
even fought the soldiers Many soldiers were wounded The mob threw fuel 
mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers setting them on fire They 
weren't afraid They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our 
troops I saw the clashes on February  near the airline ticket office right
across from our building And that mob was fighting with the soldiers The 
inhabitants of some of the buildings also Azerbaijanis threw rocks at the 
soldiers from windows balconies even cinder blocks and glass tanks They 
weren't afraid of them I say they were sure of their impunity When we were 
at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket 
office I called the police at number  and said that they were robbing 
Armenian apartments and burning homes And they told me that they knew that 
they were being burned During those days no one from the police department 
came to anyone's aid No one came to help us either to our home even though
perhaps they could have come and saved us

As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs near the bus 
station Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in 
fighting So I think all of it was arranged in advance They even knew in 
which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived on which floorsthey had
lists the bandits You can tell that the operation was  planned in advance

Thanks of course to our troops to the country's leadership and to the
leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us thanks to the Russian
people because the majority of the troops were Russians and the troops 
suffered losses too I want to express this gratitude in the name of my 
family and in the name of all Armenians and in the name of all Sumgait
Armenians For coming in time and averting terrible things worse would
have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time

At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR
Procuracy I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest
possible punishment because if they don't the tragedy the genocide could 
happen again Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted
out for such deeds

Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest in the mass 
disturbances The mobs were huge At present not all of them have been caught
very few of them have been I think judging by the newspaper reports There 
were around  people near our building alone that's how many people took 
part in the pogrom of our building all in all

They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that 
retribution awaits those who perform such acts

 A unconventional proposal for peace in the MiddleEast
  by
 			  Elias Davidsson

This could be accomplished by other criteria  One must remember
that children often bring stress into households As an alternative
one could consider financial incentives for every sexual act performed
by two partners of different ethnic backgrounds  The plan could
be entitled PEACE INCOME SEXUAL SECURITY or PISS for short

Every time an Israeli gets screwed
by a Palestinian or visa versa they would be eligible for income
In keeping with the spirit of the times condoms would be a tax deductible
expense  This policy does not discriminate on a gender basis nor
would it apply to domestic animals of either nationality

Joint PalestinanIsraeli teams would be obligated to ensure that all
acts were voluntary and promptly rewarded The teams of PalestinianIsrael
Morals Patrols or PIMPS would receive a percentage of the financial
income in order to encourage their participation and add to their
incentive in locating suitable candidates

 I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as
 well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful
                

Shouldn't that be insemination

 The way I see it Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace
 after almost  years of fighting because of the following two major reasons
 
   Arab governments are not really representative of their people currently
     most of their leaders are stupid andor not independent andor
     dictators

True but maybe not the worst possible  see Algeria  

 
   Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising
 

This was true and I may add the adjective stupid until the Intifada
Since then no serious Israeli leader including Shamir really thinks
the the occupied territories worth the trouble The only question became
the question of price and other quantitative detail The best thing the 
Palestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the Intifada
and try to live as normally as possible I know it's hard under occupation
Otherwise people might think that five years of stone throwing as justified
as it may be has caused the Palestinians an irreversible damage that 
prevents them from running a normal state when the time comes Currently 
it serves no purpose and it's just a waste of human life and economic
resources

                   THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS
   
  
  Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip 
  during the threeweeklong closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the 
  Jewish state Palestinian sources said on Sunday
  
  The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of
  the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of housetohouse raids for
  Palestinian activists during the closure which was imposed on the strip and
  occupied West Bank
  
  Five days ago girls at the AlKhansaa secondary said a group of naked
  soldiers taunted them yelling Come and kiss me'' When the girls fled 
  the soldiers threw empty bottles at them
      
  On Saturday a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their
  pants when they saw girls from AlKhansaa walking home from school Parents 
  are considering keeping their daughters home from the allgirls school
      
  The same day soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth
  escaped from them at a boys' secondary school Deputy Principal Srur 
  AbuJamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls backed them 
  against a wall and put their arms around them
  
  When teacher Hamdan AbuHajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat
  him with the butts of their rifles
  
  On Tuesday troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh a practising
  Moslem and demanded he kiss his female passenger Qdieh refused the 
  soldiers hit him and the yearold passenger kissed him to stop the 
  beating
  
  On Friday soldiers entered the home of Zamno AbuEalyan  blindfolded
  him and his wife put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance As
  the elderly couple danced the soldiers slipped away The coupled continued
  dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening
  
      The army said it was checking the reports
  
                 
  
  
       ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM
  
  Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday 
  to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper
      
  Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some  worshippers in
  prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after
  soldiers told them only people with armyissued permits could enter
  
      Right now our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy
  Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer'' said Father
  George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish
  
      Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of
  Palestinian attacks against Jews The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank
  and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem their economic spiritual and cultural centre
  
     Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation
  of requesting permits to reach holy sites
  
      Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory allowing Jews free movement
  to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian
  celebrations
  
      Yesterday we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption
  But we cannot reach our holiest sites'' he said
  
      An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech demanding to see his
  identity card before ordering the crowd to leave

  If you are tired of learning about American foreign policy from what is 
  effectively Israeli controlled media I highly recommend checking out the 
  Washington Report  A free sample copy is available by calling the American 
  Education Trust at

I took your advice and ordered a copy of the Washinton Report  I
heartily recommend it to all proIsrael types for the following 
reasons

  It is an excellent absorber of excrement  I use it to line
    the bottom of my parakeet's  cage  A negative side effect is
    that my bird now has a somewhat warped view of the mideast

  It makes a great April Fool's joke ie give it to someone
    who knows nothing about the middle east and then say April
    Fools

Anyway I plan to call them up every month just to keep getting
those free sample magazines you know how cheap we Jews are

BTW when you call them tell 'em barf sent you

Just Kidding

  It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like 
  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
  in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc
  SOME young men usually aged between  to  years are members of
  the Lebanese resistance  Even the inhabitants of the village do not 
  know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often
  suspect who they are and what they are up to  These young men are
  supported financially by Iran most of the time  They sneak arms and
  ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
  for Israeli patrols  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
  by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
  of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians  
  
  This a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups
  to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the
  opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or
  in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search Certainly the
  people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the
  innocent civilians into harm's way
  
  Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover Israel
  should totally back down Sothe easiest way to get away with attacking
  another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
  innocent lives
 
 Tell me Tim what are these guerillas doing wrong Assuming that they are using
 civilians for cover are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country If the
 buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel is it not working Why is it 
 further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages Why not just
 kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone You see there is more to
 the shelling of the villages it is called RETALIATION GETTING BACK
 GETTING EVEN It doesn't make sense to shell the villages The least
 it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of
 civilians

  Please clarify your standards for rules of engagement  As I
  understand it Israelis are at all times and under all
  circumstances fair targets  Their opponents are legitimate
  targets only when Mirandized or some such

  I'm sure that this makes perfect sense if you grant apriori
  that Israelis are the Black Hats and that therefore killing
  them is automatically a Good Thing Go Hezbollah  The
  corollary is that the Hezbollah are the White Hats and that
  whatever they do is a Good Thing and the Israelis only prove
  themselves to be Bad Guys by attacking them

  This sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan I know who cheers
  when one of the players on His Team uses his stick to permanently
  rearrange an opponent's face and curses the ref for penalizing
  His Side  Of course when it's different when the roles are
  reversed

Let me clearify Mr Turkish

ARMENIA is NOT getting itchy SHE is simply LETTING the WORLD KNOW that SHE
WILL NO  LONGER sit there QUIET and LET TURKS get away with their FAMOUS 
tricks Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH invasion of the Greek island of
CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED 



It is more appropriate to address netters with their names as they appear in
their signatures I failed to do so since you did not bother to sign your
posting Not only because it is the polite thing to do but also to avoid
addressing ladies with Mr as you have done

Secondly the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as Cyprus has
never been Greek but rather it has been home to a bicommunal society formed
of Greeks and Turks It seems that you know as little about the history and
the demography of the island as you know about the essence of Turkey's 
military intervention to it under international agreements

Be that as it may an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what
is going on today on Azerbaijani land can only be drawn with the expansionist
policy that Armenia is now pursuing

But I could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to the political
conduct of countries and promulgate them in such terminology as
itchybitchy

Well you should have noted that I was cheering an attack on an Israeli 
patrol INSIDE Lebanese territory while I was condemning the retaliatory
shelling of Lebanese villages by Israeli and Israelibacked forces My team
you see was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the
faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands so to speak 

I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on
in Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda There are no a priori
black and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in 
retaliation to pinpoint attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon and then call the
Lebanese terrorists

If the attack was justified or not is at least debatable But this is not the
issue The issue is that you were cheering DEATH Read again your original
article You find Israeli government responsible for those dead soldiers that's
a reasonable debatable point but feel satisfaction from dead bodies is 
NOT REASONABLE  by any standards No matter how you try to justify it
I may understand your frustration against israeli occupation in S Lebanon
But no matter what you say I can not understand your satisfaction for dead
bodies

I have a question for you Let's assume a bosnian village inhabited by serbs
untill a few  years ago and later taken over by bosnian muslims the means
are not very peaceful Now do you enjoy serbs coming and killing all armed
bosnian muslims  I would not enjoy but I would not enjoy ANY dead bodies

   CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES published book you'll find accounts of the
   massacres there including Deir Yassen
   though with the numbers of massacred men children and women are 
   greatly minimized

There is no known writing directly attributable to Menachem Begin
which admits a massacre at Deir Yassin  Thus Hasan is wrong

As per request of Hasan

From The Revolt by Menachem Begin Dell Publishing NY 

pp 

    Apart from the military aspect there is a moral aspect to the
story of Dir Yassin At that village whose name was publicized
throughout the world both sides suffered heavy casualties We had
four killed and nearly forty wounded The number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers The Arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy The fighting

The word troops is unjustified  There has never been any evidence
that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village
apart from the villagers defending themselves  According to the
Haganah observer Pa'il the IrgunLehi forces suffered a lot of
casualties because they were incompetent soldiers  When they ran
into trouble securing the central part of the village a small group 
of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty
Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the
major inaccuracies to use a kind word in his account

Incidentally three times as heavy may be correct as there is
serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to  lives than
to the oftquoted  lives  However note that Begin compares
wounded Jews to dead Arabs  He fails to mention the number of
wounded Arabs  Guess why

was thus very severe Yet the hostile propaganda disseminated
throughout the world deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women
children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle 

As is thoroughly established by many sources the loudspeaker truck
got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a
usueful warning

A substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt A few did not leave their
stone houses  perhaps because of the confusion The fire of the enemy
was murderous  to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony Our men were compelled to fight for every house to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades And the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties

    The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war We
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us in
accordance with the accepted custom of war to apply reprisals I am
convinced too that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle But those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin  would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy 

    In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah whom Mr
Ben Gurion at a moment of great political emotion called 'the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country' The 'wise
ruler' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey replied with feudal
superciliousness He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of
'dissidents' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities'

    The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name In the
result it helped us Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel
Kolonia village which had previously repulsed every attack of the
Haganah was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting
BeitIksa was also evacuated These two places overlooked the main
road and their fall together with the capture of Kastel by the
Haganah made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem In the
rest of the country too the Arabs began to flee in terror even
before they clashed with Jewish forces Not what happened at Dir
Yassin but what was invented about Dir Yassin helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield The legend of Dir
Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the
conquest of Haifa

It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the
Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan

 A footnote from The Revolt pp To counteract the loss
of Dir yassin a village of strategic importance Arab headquarters at
Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story alleging a massacre by
Irgun troops of women and children in the village Certain Jewish
officials fearing the Irgun men as political rivals seized upon this
Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun An eminent Rabbi was induced
to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth Out of
evil however good came This Arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops who were seized with panic at
the mention of Irgun soldiers The legend was worth half a dozen
battalions to the forces of Israel The Dir Yassin Massacre' lie
is still propagated by Jewhaters all over the world

Apparently  of Israeli historians are Jewhaters

 In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews

I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that
totally destroys Begin's whitewash  I have no particular desire
to post it yet again

 NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE
 SAN FRANCISCO  To the outside world Roy Bullock was a smalltime
 art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District  In
 reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and
 amassed secret files for the AntiDefamation League for nearly 
 years
  
 The AntiDefamation League a selfdescribed Jewish defense and civil
 rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on
 groups that are antiSemitic extremist or racist The ADL's
 factfinding division headed by Irwinn Suall in New York enjoys a
 reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with
 police agencies and journalists 

	There is something almost comical in the fact that Yigal Arens is 
important enough to have the ADL and Gd knows who else sifting through his 
garbage which happens to be legal you throw it out it ain't yours any more

	This brings to mind a few possibilities other than the ADL connection

	 it is all in Arens' mind
	 Bullock may have been working for Arens' friend in the PLO
	 Arens' father or is it brother Moshe Arens former Israeli Defense 
Minister was spying on him
	 Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention

	In any case who cares

   No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity
   Palestinians are no exception Perhaps you heard about
   antitrust in the business world
   
   Since we are debating the legality of a commercial
   transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines
   and ethics of such transactions Basic ANTITRUST law says
   that while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of
   investing you can not acquire a large number of those
   shares with the intent or controlling IBM You can do so
   only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori  Clearly
   the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some
   designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate
   They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews
   
   The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the
   old tradition of arab hospitality Being a multiethnic 
   multireligious society accepting the jews as neighbours
   was no different just another religion Plus they paid fair
   market value etc They did not know they were victims of
   an international conspiracy I'm not a conspiracy theorist
   myself but this one is hard to dismiss
   

Right now I'm just going to address this point
When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land
It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves because
for the most part they were tenant farmers fallahin
living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon
The JNF offered a premium deal so the owners took advantage of
it   It's called commerce  The owners however made no 
provisions for those who had worked for them basically shafting 
them by selling the land right out from under them
They are to blame not the Jews



Amir 
Why would you categorize the sale of land as shafting was
it because it was sold to Jews was it fair to assume that the 
fallahin would be mistreated by the jews is this the norm of 
any commerce read shafting between arabs and  jews 

Your claim that the LebaneseSyrian Landlords sold Palestine
if true even partially omits the fact that the mandate
treaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule while
Palestine under british  Obiviously any such landlord
would have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would
be motivated to sell regardless of the price

It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the
palestinians were shafted Do many Israelis or Jews share
your opinion   Do you  absolve the purchaser from
any ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down 

All told I did not see an answer in your response The
question was whether the intent behind the purchase was
aimed at controlling the public assets land
infrastructure etc IMHO the Palestinians have grounds
to contest the legality of the purchase say in world court

the Middle East in a graceful manner these are the phrases
of Nazi racial engineering pure and simple  As if Israeli
society has no right to exist per se

      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of
financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages' From their
point of view the continued existence of a specific Jewish People
overrides any other consideration be it human love peace of
human rights  The President of the World Jewish Congress Edgar
Bronfman reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he
gave to Der Spiegel a German magazine He called the increasing
assimilation of Jews in the world a calamity comparable in its
effects only with the Holocaust This objection has no merit
either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions see
above

the continued existance of a specific Jewish People overrides
any other consideration be it human love peace of human
rights  Disolve the Jewish People and protect human values
such as love and peace yes ve have heard this before Her Himmler
Notice how the source of the problem seems to be accruing to
the Jews in this analysis  Ya Der Spiegal ist a gut sourcen

      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to
bring about substantial demographic changes This objection has
merits However it must be remembered that huge sums more than
 billion are expended each year by the United States government
and by US organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the
MiddleEast through armaments A mere fraction of these sums would
suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable
climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in
IsraelPalestine thus encouraging the emergence of a
nonsegregated society in that worntorn land

Nice attempt to mix in a slam against US aid to Israel

I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as
well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful
discussion and enrichment

A unconventional proposal for peace in the MiddleEast
 by
			  Elias Davidsson

Of all the stupid postings you've brought here recently it is
illuminating that you chose to put your own name on perhaps the
stupidest of them

The following proposal is based on the following assumptions

      Fundamental human rights such as the right to life to
education to establish a family and have children to human
dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc are
more important to human existence that the rights of states

Does this mean that you are calling for the dismantling of the Arab
states 

      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and
rights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail

Apparently your answer is yes

      Attempts to solve the IsraeliArab conflict by traditional
political means have failed

Attempts to solve these problem by traditional military means and
nontraditional terrorist means has also failed  But that won't stop
them from trying again  After all it IS a Holy War you know 

      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two
distinct ethnicalreligious communitiespeoples which claim the
land there is no just nor peaceful solution possible

No just solution possible  How very encouraging

Having stated my assumptions I will now state my proposal

You mean that it gets even funnier

      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants
for each child born to a couple where one partner is IsraeliJew
and the other PalestinianArab

      For the first child the grant will amount to  For
the second the third child  for each child For each
subsequent child the grant will amount to  for each child

      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which
have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the
IsraeliArab conflict 

No the Fund should be financed by the Center for Policy Research  It
IS a major organization isn't it  Isn't it

      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'
marriages in IsraelPalestine all of whom would have relatives on
'both sides' of the divide would make the conflict lose its
ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a
truly civil society 

Yeah just like marriages among Arabs has strengthened their
societies 

The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of
people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the
MiddleEast in a graceful manner

The world could do with a bit less Middle Eastern grace

Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced I will
attempt to identify some of these

Boy you're a oneman band  Listen if you'd like to Followup on your
own postings and debate with yourself just tell us and we'll leave
you alone

Onur Yalcin Secondly the island of which the name is more correctly spelled

Who is it that executes these pinpoint attacks on Israelis  The

No it's an example of Things are nowhere near as bad as you characterize
The United States police kill as many blacks as Israel kills Palestinians
even though the US black population while admittedly larger isn't engaged in 
a civil war to attempt to destroy the government 


This probably should not be in this newgroup but Mr Frank is wrong
to use words like civil war or destroy the government in
discussing the conflict in the OCCUPIED Territories  

Re the newsgroup  followups set to talkpoliticsmideast where this
belongs

This may make the term 'civil war' dubious but it does nothing to the
phrase 'destroy the government' An occupying government is still a govern
ment and the Palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is
not simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that don't con
fer citizenship which is your own determination of the distinction but
to wipe it out entirely and not incidentally the entire Jewish population
it rules with it This is an intent to 'destroy the government' no
matter where the government happens to be from

If the
current government in Isreal would be willing to let all adult individuals
who are capable  to
vote in elections within the DEFACTO boundaries of the Isreali
state a requirement for being called a democracy in my opinion

Wasn't a requirement for democracy in Athens For that matter isn't
a requirement for the term democracy in the United States which doesn't
let noncitizens vote either Both the United States and Israel have
processes whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship with a great
deal of effort and a modicum of screening  it's just that it isn't
automatic for living in the territories It isn't automatic for living
in New York either

That said suit yourself Having never considered democracy the ultimate
in Good In This World I could care less if you feel like calling Israel
or America or anywhere else a democracy Personally I withhold the
term from Israel for the same reason I withhold it from Britain the
parliamentary system is a serious handicap

then Mr Frank would be correct  As the current government neither
is willing to 
enfrachise the vast majority of individuals in the territories or to
allow these people to have the right to self determination it is not
a civil war or THEIR government rather it is resitance to a FOREIGN
occupier

Again suit yourself In which case Israel is not attacking its own
people it is fighting a war on foreign soil in which case the residents
are entitled to play rough yes  but Israel's allowed to get just as
rough within the bare limits of the rules of war This includes among
other things the right to shoot or bomb anyone a national of the coun
try in question who is fighting them which permits mass frontal assault
on all rockthrowers along with the right to take out any installation
of military importance certain villages with toogood fortifications can
be handled by aerial bombing as can waterways since they count as supply
lines to the enemy and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever
constitutes a government that they can lay hands on if Hamas is trying
to set up as the ruling party let them beware 

If this is not the scenario you want I recommend you go back to calling
it a civil war Civil wars have to be handled nicer You cannot say the
Palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign
nation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own people
cruelly If the Palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country
so is Israel and the gloves come off

 everyone else  Unfortunately for you Nabil Jewish tribes are not
 nearly as susceptible to the fratricidal murdering that is still so
 common among Arabs in the Middle East  There were no  killings
 between the Jewish tribes on the way

I don't like this comment about Typical thinking You could state
your interpretation of Exodus without it As I read Exodus I can see 
a lot of killing there which is painted by the author of the bible
in ideologicalreligious colors The history in the desert can be seen
as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land That's why I think
it is a great book with which descendants Arabs Turks and Mongols can 
unify as well

It depends entirely on how you define 'war' The actual fighting largely
predates the Arab invasions  after all Deir Yassin happened in midApril
well before the Arab invasion

How do you define war  Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages
count as acts of war or is that only when the Jews do them

I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might
wait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it
As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it If you just look at attacks
on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started Would you
count the riots in the 's and 's Violence but not war I personally
think that 'war' as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever requires
organisation planning and some measure of regualr or semiregular forces
Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts I could easily be convinced it was
so From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone
organisation The Haganah and Palmach certainly did That is not a cause
for criticism it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the
'Zionist' camp

Of course this isn't war since it's only the Arabs attacking

Now you are being silly aren't you In any case the war did NOT start
with the invasion of the Arab Armies You see we both agree on something
And the previous posters were wrong no

Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets
against Northern israel  Where does uprising end and war begin

Again I am not sure I doubt you want my opinion anyway but I think
war requires organisation as I said before It needs a group to command
and plan If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon and are you
sure you have the right group  not the Moslems again then that sounds
like war to me Stone throwing does not

If the Israelis are stupid enough to allow a second Palestinian
state the first one is Jordon then you will probably get your
wish  and the Israelis would get what's coming to them

However if the Palestinians were to somehow demonstrate that 
they could govern themselves AND live in peace with their 
Jewish neighbors then they would have to give up the idea of
Jerusalem as a part of their state  and you would be disappointed

 Ten questions to Israelis
 
 
 I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to
 provide
  accurate answers to the following specific questions These are
 indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
 people around me

I lived there until July  so I think that on the whole
my input is relevant

       Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize
 Israeli nationality  And that ID cards which Israeli citizens
 must carry at all times identify people as Jews or Arabs not as
 Israelis 

Those are two separate questions  Obviously Israeli authorities do
recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes eg passports
consular services etc  ID cards have a field of nationality
which is a subdivision of the above  Ostensibly this field
is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments
of the gov't though this is not the general case

       Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders
 and that Israeli governments from  until today have refused to
 state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be
 

From its onset Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both
war and peace  As such the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining
its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have
been conluded with its neighbors  There is no plan for ultimate borders
is this a game like ultimate frisbee extending into  other countries

       Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons  If so
 could you provide any evidence 

Aside from what Vaanunu provided no

       Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of
 individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
 identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
 state secrets 

If that is true then by virtue of the question's subject it is
unanswerable  Anyone who claims its validity is claiming an oxymoron
That having been said I deny the above

You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious
bias  Questions of the sort Is it true that you entered your
mother's vagina which are based upon some kernel of truth though
phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions
upon Israel  Incidentally the answer to the above is usually yes
unless you were born via a Csection

Dorin of all the criticism of my post expressed on tpm this one I accept
I regret that aspect of my post It is my hope that the occupation will end and
the accompanying loss of life but I believe that stiff resistance can help to 
achieve that end Despite what some have said on tpm I think that there is 
a point when losses are unacceptable The strategy drove US troops out of

henrik  The Armenians in NagarnoKarabagh are simply DEFENDING their 
henrik  RIGHTS to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are 
henrik  INVADING their homeland


HE     Homeland First NagarnoKarabagh was Armenians homeland today
HE     Fizuli Lacin and several villages in Azerbadjan
HE     are their homeland Can't you see the
HE     the  Great Armenia dream in this With facist methods like
HE     killing raping and bombing villages The last move was the
HE     blast of a truck with  kurdish refugees trying to
HE     escape the from Lacin a city that was given to the Kurds
HE     by the Armenians

NagornoKarabakh is in Azerbaijan not Armenia Armenians have lived in Nagorno
Karabakh ever since there were Armenians Armenians used to live in the areas
between Armenia and NagornoKarabakh and this area is being used to invade 
Nagorno Karabakh Armenians are defending themselves If Azeris are dying
because of a policy of attacking Armenians then something is wrong with this 
policy

If I recall correctly it was Stalin who caused all this problem with land
in the first place not the Armenians

henrik  However I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane
henrik  to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
henrik  that happened last SUMMER Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
henrik  carrying humanitarian aid bound to ARMENIA

HE     Don't speak about things you don't know  US Cargo planes
HE     were heading to Armenia When the Turkish authorities
HE     announced that they were going to search these cargo
HE     planes  of these planes returned to it's base in Germany
HE      of these planes were searched in Turkey The content of
HE     of the other  planes Not hard to guess is it It was sure not
HE     humanitarian aid

What story are you talking about Planes from the US have been sending
aid into Armenian for two years I would not like to guess about what were in
the  planes in your story I would like to find out


HE     Search Turkish planes You don't know what you are talking about
HE     Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
HE     to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
HE     it self not the Karabag province So why search a plane for weapons
HE     since it's content is announced to be weapons

It's too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia

 	WASHINGTON UPI  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday
 there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than
 ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs but a frustrated senator
 told him to do just that
 	We've not done a damn thing'' Sen Joseph Biden DDel told
 Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
 Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia
 Herzegovina
 	Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for
 what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of 
 ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims including rape and shelling of
 civilians
 	The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact
 that all the options are bad ones'' Biden said They are all bad ones
 and we ought to pick a couple''
 	Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the
 former Yugoslavia so the Muslimdominated Bosnian government might have
 a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs
 	Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to
                     
 the radical Islamic government of Iran

O I C
   Biden endorsed bombing Serbian heavy weapons around the besieged
  eastern town of Srebrenica
  	There's not a military personwho will not tell you that they
  could today if you gave them the order take out the heavy weaponry
  around Srebrenica'' Biden said
  	If you did nothing else nothing else but that you would have
  saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred
  right now''
  	Military action is the only thing that's going to change the
  equation'' Biden said

  	Despite the frustrations and pressure Christopher had no enthusiasm
  for American combat aircraft to strike Serb positions in Bosnia
  Herzegovina

	Clearly we are at a turning point in the Bosnia situation''
Christopher said Air strikes are among those steps that are so
complex because they tend to interfere with the humanitarian endeavours
I think there may be better options''

Humanitarian as in feeding them and let them get raped and killed

political conflict Clinton vowed during the presidential campaign to
	             then
lift the arms embargo and to strike at Serbian heavy weapons with US
combat aircraft
	Christopher said airstrikes would likely increase the level of
	Now
fighting and cause our allies to draw back'' or even pull out the
humanitarian effort''
	Great Britain and France have balked at foreign military intervention
in BosniaHerzegovina for fear that their peacekeeping troops on the
ground may suffer Serbian retribution

Why don't they get the hell out of there they ared doing nothing to
protect the victims anyway Maybe becasue they have a different agenda

	Sen Nancy Kassebaum RKan seemed to agree with Christopher's
         
assessment and stressed the need not to build up Bosnian expectations
for heavy US military intervention
	It's very important that expectations aren't raised high on the
part of the beleagured Bosnians'' she said
	Air strikes might have made a difference eight months ago she said
but the strategic significance of that step now is questionable Like
Christopher Kassebaum said it might jeopardize the humanitarian relief
effort

Now that they made sure the Bosnian who were the only real subject of the
embargo last year as everybody knows that the Serbs had an unlimited supply
of arms wre massacred without having a chance to defend themselves Now this
evil coldhearted snake is saying it is too late to save them so let them die

 Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary

	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave Lebanon when
the Lebanese government can provide guarantees that Israel will not be
attacked from Lebanese soil and when the Syrians leave

Not acceptable Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if
they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion
where they were both part of the same mandate territory  read
colony

	And Lebanon has a right to make this decision without Syrian
troops controlling the country  Until Syria leaves and free
elections take place its is rediculous to claim that the Lebanese
would even be involved in determining what happens to their country

Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon Invading another
country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost
all wars of aggression have started

	I expect you will agree that the same holds true for Syria
having no right to be in Lebanon

	Israel has already annexed areas taken over in the  war
These areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no
legitamate governing body  Citizenship was given to those residents
in annexed areas who wanted citizenship

The UN defines them as occupied They are recognised as such by every
nation on earth excluding one small caribean island

	The UN also thought Zionism is racism  That fails to make it true

	The first reason was security  A large Jewish presense makes
it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate  A Jewish settlements also
act as fortresses in times of war

Theyu also are a liability We are talking about civilian encampments that
would last no more than hours against tanks

	They lasted weeks against tanks in ' and stopped those
tanks from advancing  They also lasted days in '  There is little
evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities

	They evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take
place over the Jordan river the existance of large patrolled
kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area where they are
usually picked up in the morning

	A second reason was political  Creating settlements brought
the arabs to the negotiation table  Had the creation of new towns and
cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in
Israel where there was an arab majority  There would have been no
land left that could be called arab

Don't fool yourself It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the
negotiating table Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else

	Nonsense  Israel has been trying to get its neighbors to the
negotiating table for  years  It was the gulf war that brought the
arabs to the table not the Israelis

	The point is there are many reasons people moved over the
green line and many reasons the government wanted them to  Whatever
status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all
or nothing deal  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not
be the results of a war

Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of  there will be no peace
Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else

	Nonsense  According to Arafat Israel must be destroyed  He
has never come clean and denied that this is his plan  He always
waffles on what he means

	When the Arabs set off their volcano there will only be Arabs in
	this part of the world  Our people will continue to fuel the torch
	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
	occupied homeland is liberated''

The readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents
of those files
So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us
 Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous

ADL authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous including
the millions of Americans of Arab ancestry  Perhaps you can answer
the question as to why the ADL maintained files and spied on ADC members
in California and elsewhere  Friendly rivalry perhaps

Come on  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war 
against Israel  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations  That is
the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals
only a few years ago  


The ADC is an organization of ArabAMERICANS

Let me seeyou're saying that most if not all ArabAMERICANS should be
spied on  You're also saying that most if not all ArabAMERICANS
should be views as a national security threat to Israel and the US 
as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the WTC bombing in 
which no ArabAMERICANS were involved  By inference can we assume 
that you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses 
a threat to Israel and therefore should be spied on

Perhaps then on the basis of Pollard spy case not to mention the
Rosenbergs etc you think that all Jewish Americans should be spied 
on by the ADC

Oh never mind this whole spying case has obviously so 
convoluted your sense of right or wrong in these matters that I have 
no wish confuse you further

Perhaps Yigal is a Greenpeace member Or the NAACP Or a reporter 
Or a member of any of the dozens of other political organizationsethnic 
minoritiesoccupations that the ADL spied on

All of these groups have in the past associated with or been a part of anti
Israel activity or propoganda  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if
anything comes up they won't be caught by surprise

So the LA times reporter who had information about him
sold to the South African government was involved in antiIsrael
activity or propaganda Are we to infer that the simple act of
reporting an event in a newspaper constitutes antiIsrael
activity or propaganda  Or was it South Africa  The LA 
times reporter was based in South Africa after all

 Turanist brash calls for more Turkish influence he also has spoken
 Turanist of a swath of Turkic peoples stretching from the Adriatic
 Turanist Sea to the Great Wall of China
 
 Who does Demirel think he is fooling It seems at both ends of his envisioned
 panTurkic Empire  the Balkans and the Caucasus  Turkey's fascist boasts
 are being preempted
 
 I would suggest Turkey let the world feel some of their Grey Wolf Teeth
and
 attempt to stretch from the Adriatic to China Turkey will have cried wolf
 just once too much 

Mentioning that Turkic people are widespread means desiring a Turkish empire
Is that the logical thing to conclude from a statement like that 
To me it just says that Turkey may have economical benefits from that
if she can be competitive enough No more than that But of course
you have the freedom of extrapolating as you wish from any statement

One question In what context did Ozal use the words you are quoting
Can you give the whole speech

By Elias Davidsson  April  Revision Oct 

Note  you are already posting facts some of which are outdated

The biased presentation of facts as well as the conclusions that
you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful
exchange that might lead to a meeting of the minds  It is to those
who read with open mind that I address myself

The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the
United Nations in  has now been ratified by most member
states Article  of this Convention defines the term racial
discrimination as any distinction exclusion restriction or
preference based on race colour descent or national or ethnic
origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing
the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of
human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political economic
social cultural or any other field of public life

While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals
as the text currently stands I know of no country in which
racial discrimination of some sort can not be found
It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative
violation

The General Assembly endorsed in  a resolution defining
Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination The
important correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since
it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli
racial discrimination Meanwhile the United States on behalf of
Israel are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United
Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial
practices  Zionism  moral legitimacy

If you are in principle advocating UN intervention via operative
statements in this case it must therefore hold that they can be
applied to any other case where the council perceives some form
of racial discrimination as previously exhibited

Scarey thought

The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of
the world but not to its inhabitants alienates all native
nonJews born in that country 

Actually I know quite a few native nonJews born in Israel that are not
alienated by this law  If you had said some you would probably be
correct however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes
apparent  This slant permeates the text

Practically all nonJews who are living in or originate from areas
under Israeli control identify themselves as Palestinians Most
of them are Muslim many are Christian A few Jews including the
author of these lines also identify themselves as Palestinians

The above statement is not true  Practically all  discounting
Beduins Circassians Druze and some other fringe groups
Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the
issue  You could equally identify yourself as a insert group

Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century It's aim
was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant
opposition of Palestinian Arabs  of the population

If I recall correctly at the time zionism took off there
was no adamant opposition in Palestine  I am open to any
factual contradictory evidence 

But the
Zionists were more powerful militarily economically and
technologically and succeeded in  in conquering  of the
area of Mandatory Palestine After driving into exile most native
Arabs from the conquered areas approximately  people and
razing most of their villages to the ground the Zionists could
finally establish a predominantly Jewish State Only 
nonJews remained on Israeli territory

Do you therefore contend that the  villages you mention further on most
of their villages

Once the Jewish State was established it began enacting laws to
help the confiscation of land from native nonJews their
political repression and their destitution

There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later
used for these purposes  However you seem to imply that this was the
intention a priori which implies a policy and agenda  My knowledge was
that this was not the case

You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded
this  As you do again below

In  the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied
the rest of Palestine the West Bank and the Gaza strip Thus
another  million Palestinians fell under its juridiction Its
occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered
illegal by the international community as reflected in Security
Council resolutions Israel has rejected all UN resolutions and
began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these
territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time

Not quite accurate  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions
though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them
Israel never annexed the Sinai West Bank or Gaza  The other
annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions

Part of these territores East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights
have already been forcefully annexed by Israel in defiance of
international law and UN resolutions

Out of curiousity provided that the annexees are granted citizenship
what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories
captured in war  Has this ever been applied to any other country
previously other than Iraq 

It must be emphasized that although these people live under
different regimes they are united in their selfperception as
Palestinians that is as people identifying with Palestine a
territorial entity not an ethnic or religious entity

Incorrect Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against
on an ethnic or racial basis  Therefore your above statement is
incorrect

I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination
the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically
However no such nation has existed  It definitely did not exist
at the time of the creation of Israel in which case you can not
argue racial discrimination during that period

Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a
symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that
represents them in world affairs

Once again some do some don't

The nonJewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab
territories occupied by Israel in  suffers not only blatant
discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation

Another generalization but then again you don't seem to care
about anyone other than the Palestinian people whose cause you
espouse

licence to start a business and to buy industrial equipment the
right to educate children all of these basic rights are subject
to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be
challenged in court

Incorrect once again  They have the ability to appeal
Furthermore although you may not agree with them not all
of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary  Some
are but this is not due to the whims of the military as
much as the sizeof the taskorganization

Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied
territories are permitted to carry firearms

Incorrect once again  I know two Arab policemen who lived in
Daheisha and there were more  Of course with the outbreak of
the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign bitterly

Jewish settlers have
right to  more water per person than nonJews Jewish residents
of these territories number now about  people It is Israel
governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially in
total defiance of international law UN resolutions and the will
of the population The State of Israel systematically confiscates
land from nonJewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish
settlement

That is no longer true and I can't help but wonder what your
purpose iswas in posting this

Some  people in Israel properare not Jews Most of them
consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship For
many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected
to harsh military control Much of their land was confiscated by
the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish
settlement They have been subject to massacres destitution and
humiliation While they enjoy with Jewish Israelis the right to
vote they are discriminated against both through law and in
practice

Once again to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in
right  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way
you seem to indicate Abu Gosh comes to mind  Yes some did but
as a result of what actions

Approximately  of the surface of the State of Israel within the
Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are
secondclass citizens in Israel They may neither legally live on
such land nor rent or cultivate it A direct effect of these
policies is that native nonJewish citizens of Israel are denied
residence and membership rights in most rural communities in
Israel including the collective settlements kibbutzim NonJews
are discriminated against in many other ways The Government
starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of
funds Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos
Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their
nonJewish neighbors Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and
understaffing as compared to Jewish schools Palestinian
children are denied the right to learn their history and
literature Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end
of racial discrimination suffer continuous harassment by the
authorities

  There are some kibbutzim with ArabNonJewish members
    It is up to the members of the kibbutz  There is no
    legislation against it nor against a purely nonJewish
    collective

  Funds are the result of political lobbying  Bearing in mind
    that nonJews compose  of the voting population it has
    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large
    bloc and increase their power  The recent elections are a case 
    in point

  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation
    with regard to educational material  You have obviously
    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank
    It is based upon Jordan's school system

  With regard to your last statement it is simply another
    gross generalization  

The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of
all its inhabitants  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never
openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea the forced removal from the
country of its native Palestinian population that is its
ultimate Judaization Israeli government policies towards
nonJews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution' No attempt is
made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs
into Israeli public life Thus although comprising approximately
 of the population of Israeli citizens no Palestinian citizen
of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member as director of 
ministry or of a national institution as judge of the Supreme
Court as ambassador of Israel or in any leading position in
Israeli economic or financial life Even the director of the
Ministry for Arab Affairs  yes such a thing exists  is a Jew

Another generalization but lets not stop here
The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't
Moledet  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the
territories not the country itself  With regard to other items
I recall at least one Arab ambassador and the rest was covered
previously

Although sexual
relations between and cohabitation of Jews and nonJews are legal
they are considered by IsraeliZionist society somewhat a betrayal
of the Jewish and Zionist ethics The Israeli educational system
nurtures this attitude in a systematic way

When was the last time you were in Israel  That is simply not true
nor has it been for quite some time  The question of religious
intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and
the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one

Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state based on
equality of all citizens This is one main reason why Israel has
not produced any written Constitution 

Simply incorrect
The answer is political  Once again your failure to understand the
dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't relegates your
contentions to the sidelines

Zionism predicates a state
where Jews have privileged rights Thus according to Israeli law
a Jew born in London who has never visited Israel does not speak
Hebrew and professes atheism is granted automatic Israeli
citizenship while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be
Christian or Muslim are treated almost as aliens  Racial
discrimination as defined in international law is thus not only
reflected in Israeli laws and policies but is grounded in the
very nature of Israel as a Jewish state

But the discrimination is not based upon race
Oops sorry nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths

Any proposal for IsraeliArab and IsraeliPalestinian peace that
does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel 
that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel  is thus doomed
to fail

Real world intrusion  any proposal that does is doomed to fail
Of course I wouldn't expect you to understand wrapped up as
you are in your VIEW of things  Let's not let anything penetrate
shall we  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the
amount of patience I have for rubbish at

This is historically incorrect  Early Zionist 'fighters' did indeed

    This is such Bullshit  Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on
    the part of the Jews and a massacre defines it best in my
    opinion  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the
    Jews a peace pact but the Irgun purposely broke this
    agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians  I might
    grant that this village housed armed Arabs I doubt it but
    nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
    this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun  The Deir Yassin
    MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
    Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homelandand contrary to
    your belief many civilians were killed  Deir Yassin was later
    advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was
    useful in getting many Palestinians to leave  The Palestinians
    were rightfully scared off because they did not want another
    Deir Yassin  
 	   I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here
    atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs
    Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are
    and were the good guys in the middle east  Both Arab and Jew
    suck equally
 
 rjs you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgun
 to attack Dir Yassin was its strategic importance In fact Begin
 who was in charge of the Irgun wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for
 its military significance
 
 Dir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation People died
 But the thing was never intended to be a masacre That this hapenned
 is a tragedy of war  not a crime of the Irgun
 
 Harry
 
 
I agree with you Harry however you must also concede then that
Arab terrorism is also a tragedy of war  remember that the
Palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in
order to further their cause  If Irgun had to attack civilian
targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some
objective I'm sure they would have done so  I also don't
exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism
The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with
regards to Palestine and the Irgun and branch off groups made
a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and
fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued
presence in Palestine  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me
and not much removed from Arab terrorism  We must not also
forget that Irgun or Irgun branch off groups more likely
killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they or
who cooperated with the British  
	I'll reiterate again both sides are screwy but
I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they
were a bit screwed

There are basically three alternatives for Gaza

What is this Gaza Are you purposely separating it from the West Bank
If so why separate the people and territories If not why are you just
addressing Gaza here 

  To throw the Jews to the sea that is basically to make them leave
   the MiddleEast and go back to where they came from russia Europe 
  USA etc

By all means continue to list the etc The reason I particularly
bring this up here is that there are many from middle eastern
and west asian countries That fact in itself adds an important
element to any consideration of resolution of the ArabIsrael
conflict

  To throw the Gazans into the sea in accordance with Yitzhak Rabin's
     wish and that of many Zionists

You explained what sea meant with regard to the Israelisjews
please do so in this case

  For Israelis and Palestinians to come to an honorable and fair I
    don't attempt to say just settlement 

Just You better not ask for that because that would mean North 
American tribes would be returned their lands the preIslamic tribes 
would take back their lands from the Islamic invaders the Saxons get 
to kick the Normans out of the UK the central and south american 
tribes get to kick the spanish descendents out of thier lands 
And once we have returned the land to those who last possessed it 
we have to find out from whom they stole it At some point every 
culture stole the land they are on from previous occupants

   which would allow each person to live in dignity in his country in 
   freedom and equality

But wait Now you refer to Palestinians so what happened to Gaza

I personnaly opt for the third alternative How about you folks 

As we both know most people would choose the third alternative And
since you have done so in the past perhaps you would initiate things by 
presenting your vision of resolution In doing so however the worries
not paranioas worries and resonable expectations of both
parties should be considered

I am replying to this because I haven't seen anyone else do so yet It
seems rather odd really as there are so few really wierd posters left
who aren't fascists or Arab extremists

Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin But there was no massacre

Yes it was and it was clearly admitted so by the troops who carried it
out and then stupidly deposited testimony in their own archives to that
effect

First
of all the village housed many armed troops

Source Noone is claiming this anymore except you Would you like
to name one credible historian who asserts this I believe that
even Begin has the decency not to claim this

Secondly the Irgun
and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians

Yes they did and thye said so  they said they went their with the
intention of killing all the men and all the women who got in their
way Their own archives remember this is not hostile testimony

The village was attacked only for its military significance In fact
a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before
the attack was to begin

Sound van bogged down in a ditch No warning given

By all rational standards Dir Yassin was not a massacre The killing
was unintentional

Yes it was and no it was not It was a massacre  the murder of hundreds
of unarmed civilians who had no part in the fighting The surviving men
were taken to the local quarry and shot in the back of the head Not
intentional Yeah right

The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops

No it did not  you have a source for this slander of course

Thus it was attacked for its military significance It was not
attacked with intentions of killing any civilians

The men involved said clearly that the intention was to kill all the
men It was a premeditated mass murder nothing else

To even compare Dir Yassin in which some  or so Arabs died to the
Holocaust is absurd

On that we agree at least

The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians The
village had almost  inhabitants most of whom survived

Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed
This is of course simple to resolve the Haganah sent a soldier to report
on the massacre He brought a photographer with him He sent in a report
The Israeli government suppressed it Now the government was a Labour
Government Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for
some reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either
Perhaps you might want to tell me why If it happened as you claim then
there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied
behind their backs no women and children shot as they slept Yet for
some reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name You
have a reason for this don't you I somehow doubt it The facts are
exactly as the people responsible claim  a premeditated mass murder
nothing else No Iraqi soldiers no other fighting Just ethnic cleansing
at work

                 to capture booty in order to maintain
                 the bases which we had then established
                 with very poor resources The main idea
                 despite this remained the conquest of
                 the village by force of arms something
                 which was then unknown in the country
                 and became a turning point in Jewish
                 military operations

                 Yehuda Lapidot Jabontinsky Archives Testimony

                 Apart from the military discussion the
                  Lehi put forward a proposal to liqui
                  date the residents of the village after
                  the conquest in order to show the Arabs
                  what happens when the IZL and the Lehi
                  set out together on an operation and for
                  another main reason  it would cause a
                  great uproar throughout the land and
                  would be an important turning point in
                  the course of the battles The clear aim
                  was to break the Arab morale and raise
                  somewhat the morale of the Jewish commu
                  nity in Jerusalem which had been hit
                  hard time after time especially recenctly
                  by the desecration of Jewish bodies which
                  fell into Arab hands

                  Yehuda Lapidot Jabotinsky Archives
                  testimony as quoted by Yisrael Segal in
                  The Deir Yassin File published by
                  Koteret Rashit th January 

So it wasn't like the Holocaust more like Lidice  a warning a punishment
Collective and inflicted on unarmed innocents just not as through

                 When it comes to prisoners old people
                  and children there were differences
                  of opinion but the majority was for
                  liquidation of all the men in the village
                  and any other force that opposed us
                  whether it be old people women or children

                  Commander of the attack on Deir Yassin

Let me put in some words here
                a premeditated
                b murder
What do you say about the eyewitness testimony of the man in command

                 We had prisoners and before the retreat
                  we decided to liquidate them We also
                  liquidated the wounded as anyway we could
                  not give them first aid In one place
                  about eighty Arab prisoners were killed
                  after some of them had opened fire and
                  killed one of the people who came to give
                  them first aid Arabs who dressed up
                  as Arab women were also found and so
                  they started to shoot the women also who
                  did not hurry to the area where the
                  prisoners were concentrated

                  JAT

Shooting prisoners the wounded as a warning to hurry Sounds VERY
familiar to me how about you Heard of other people other places doing
these things

                 In one case  the Zahran family  only
                  one out of twenty five survived In
                  another house they caught the sixteen
                  year old son Fuad His mother was holding
                  him They killed him with a knife The
                  mother spent twenty years after that in
                  a mental hospital A young woman and her
                  two year old baby were shot in the
                  street Their bodies were left there
                  They moved to the centre of the village
                  and started to kill everybody they saw or
                  heard as soon as anybody opened his
                  door They were using bombs grenades
                  machineguns submachineguns My cousin
                  escaped with bulletholes in his clothes
                  One of the officers put his machinegun
                  through a window and started shooting
                  outwards killing everybody who moved
                  They killed my uncle Ali Hassan Zeidan
                  and my aunt Fatima She heard him call
                  'help me' She ran to him and they killed
                  her Another neighbour Haj Yarah
                  heard some voices and came out They killed
                  him too His son Muhammad who was
                  about seventeen heard his father call
                  him and went to the same place They
                  killed him His mother heard her son cry
                  for help She ran out and they killed

                 In the exchange that followed four men
                  were killed and a dozen were wounded
                  by noon time the battle was over and
                  the shooting had ceased Although there
                  was a calm the village had not yet surrendered
                  The Irgun and Lehi men came
                  out of hiding and began to 'clean' the houses
                  They shot whoever they saw women
                  and children included the commanders did
                  not try and stop the massacreI
                  pleaded with the commander to order his
                  men to cease fire but to no avail In
                  the meantime twenty five Arabs had been
                  loaded on a truck and driven through
                  MahaneYehuda and Zichron Yosef At the
                  end of the drive they were taken to

   Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest
points I would still like to know why do do not ask any question
of this sort about the Arab countries

Kaufman
I think we have a problem in this newsgroup every time somebody puts
down serious questions on Israel the first response would be what about
the Arab countries 

Most of the Arab countries governments are ruling their people with Iron
fist policy and Dark Ages democracy if exists Ironically these are 
the countries that the West would like to deal with and would wage 
massive wars to protect them and their resources

For Israel the situation is different Israel claims it is a
democracy  I would call it selective democracy that abides by Western
democratic standards If Israel is saying that then
it has to be compared to Western standards If this comparison is the
advertized propaganda from Israel then we have to look at seriously at
question that can and should be asked regarding any country advertizing
this standard 

   If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours your
fixation on Israel must stop  You might have to start asking the
same sort of questions of Arab countries as well  You realize it
would not work as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the
last several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would
begin to look like the biased attack that it is

That is very incorrect I see you have been brainwashed well I would
recommend nonZionist history books

   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for
Policy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot
who hates Israel

Please speak for yourself Do not imagine that everyone subscribes to
your beliefs you would be lucky if you believe them yourself


   Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel  I
have heard that your family once lived in Israel but the members
of your family could not cut the competition there  Is this true
about your family  Is this true about you  Is this actually not
about Israel but is really a personal vendetta  Why are you not
 

What is this you trying to destroy the credibility of the author why
all of this because he asked some serious question These tactics of
destroying the credibility of a person beacuse you do not agree with
herhim is old and does not work anymore go tell your superiors
AIPAC to change their guide books

	I think some of you guys think that the volume of your
responses and their harshness somehow increases their factual
accuracy I especially deplore the attempts to call me a racist
as many of you have done You guys think just because 
there are more unreasonable Israelis on this PCNEWS channel
than all other denominations combined Including reasonable 
Israelis that somehow makes you right Well you're wrong
	I just started reading this stuff last sunday and
thought I might butt in since there were severe information
problem on the part of some people I thought that through
somewhat intelligent conversation we might enlighten each
other

That would be nice but considering professional diplomats between Israel and
Athe Arabs have been unable to do so for  years I can't see us starting
But hey  as soon as anyone wants to discuss things reasonably and in a 
scholarly manner count me in

Anyway the responses were mostly negative and I've been
called a racist and an antisemite so many times that it seems
assumed about me in people's postings When I shared this with
some of my friends it appears that they have had similar
experiences The overall harsh language coupled with the
occasional death threats and attempts to get them disconnected
have convinced many to look elsewhere for true discussions and
unsubscribe to the newsgroup 

People have very strong opinions and you need to be careful regarding what 
you say  if you say make it factual and be able to back it up

	I don't know if you're paid Israeli lobbyists or just 
concerned but it seems that toning down the harsh rhetoric
might be more helpful to your cause than namecalling 
attempting to disconnect and death threats Just a tip about
how things work in the civilized world

Thanks for teaching us about the civilized world Andi  I guess we all just 
came out either the desert or the ghetto right  And no we are not paid
Israeli lobbyists nor are we conspirators of the ZOG  we are just people who
believe in our cause and find offense when people imply some sort dirty dealing
or disloyalty due to our love of Israel disguised as paid Israeli lobbyists 
what kind of image is that 

PS I understand that not all of you are involved in all this
but many of you are contributing to the atmosphere
PPS Just to clear up something I don't think than the Jews
are necessarily any worse than other people as a whole if such a
distinction between cultures shall be madeI don't personally
believe in judging people by their religion culture or race

Oh  Thank you  I needed your approval of my heritage  I guess I can go home
and feel good now and sleep comfartably knowing that Jews really aren't
worse people than anyone else contrary to what we all know is true

TC Do you as I do agree that this sort of peace process is needed
TC What about the particular points mentioned in the article Is what
TC Israel is supposedly going to propose good Does it go too far
TC Not far enough
TC If you don't agree that a peace process is needed what is

I personally think that a peace process is needed since only through
negotiations will the future generations be able to live in stability
Unfortunately not all think like this we have cases like
	Anas Omran Hamza Saleh Jle Mohammed Reza Mehmed AbuAbed 
Anwar Mohammed and others who think that JIHAD is the only solution 

If we can't avoid throwing out gutreactions to what we see as extremist
views here in the newsgroup we're certainly not going to be any better at
it in the real world Hey it easy here After reading the offending post 
we can step back take some deep breathing exercises have a gallon of
ice cream or sex whichever calmsus and reply in something other
than the usual kingofthehill mentality  

My view is that Israel has made more gestures towards its Arab foes than the
opposite What have the Sysrians given to us or proposed What have the
Palestinians proposed If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their 
charter or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good
start

Perhaps starting here with an immediate accusation is not a particularly
good way to generate open responses How about explaining what you see as
being Israel's real worries and how they need to be addressed Since
the other side sees Israel's gestures in a completely different light
than you do perhaps they also have real worries From their point
of view what are they How can those worries be addressed 

The Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations Its seems though
that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are
plagued by internal strife that is why we are not getting anywhere
Fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories then it will be
too late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only
vow for the destruction of Israel

It is certainly much harder to reach compromise or even sit down
and talk with an other side which is fractured into several
different ideologies each with its own set of demands While it is
up to them to generate unity on their side is there anything that
Israel can do without sacrificing its security its position to
encourage that unification along lines that Israel prefers

Arabs  must take example on Egypt Egypt came to the bargaining table
got what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation
between the two countries 
The tougher you play ball with Israel the tougher Israel gets

rjsVirginiaEDU Get thee to a nunnery writes

First of all Harry I am not so uninformed about Irgun's
TERRORIST activities  I'll give you a few quotes from a book
by Charles D Smith in his Palestine and the Arab Israeli
Conflict  

Ah  Palestine and the Arab Israeli conflict  Sounds interesting

Begin directed the Irgun to bomb only civilian that's right
CIVILIAN installations linked to the mandatory authority not
military sites  

This is misleading  I supposed Charles D Smith characterizes the bombing
of the King David Hotel as a civilian installation too  Any installation 
attacked by Etzel was linked to some sort of official function of the 
Mandatory government

and of course there is the LEHI splinter group which included
such notable Israelis as Yitzak Shamir  the LEHI fighters
for the freedom of Israel resumed its assassinations of
British officials CIVILIAN and military

What kind of CIVILIANS  I assume Charles D Smith means completely innocent
people who were intentionally targeted right  Please provide examples

and there is of course Dair Yassin where  men woman and
children were killed  perhaps I'm sure for strategic
reasons yet what ever happened to the non aggression pact with
the Hagana  I have references for that if you'd like  It
seems to me like blatant scare tactics that Begin himself
admits to having been very useful in scaring off the
Palestinian Arabs  i do have references The Revoltlos
angeles  

Nice strawman  In The Revolt Begin does state that the myth of a massacre
at Deir Yassin may have had the effect of scaring some Arabs into fleeing
However nowhere does he claim that this was the result of any specific policy
of the Etzel  Thus if it did happen it was not so intended  I think Arab 
calls for Palestinians to leave and fear of a war started by Arab hands had 
a greater effecton Arab migration than Deir Yassin

In fact these jewish TERRORIST groups managed
all in all to scare off   Arabs by may  

Really  Nice use of caps  I like it  Very effective  Actually according to 
many sources including American diplomatic officials the greatest encouragment
for Arabs to leave their villages came from Arab leaders

This certainly might be all a matter of semantics however  You
might say that the Hagana did this for war  but like I said
before how do we not know that the Palestinian conflict isn't
equatable with a war  If Israel never got her state the
Hagana's activities would be lost in history categorized as
tewrrorism for sure because it could not be identified with the
cause of a state  I do take this seriously Harry  I

    Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets the
 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin
on April   targeted the village for its military importance
Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem which the Arabs had
blockaded and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars
Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens
in Jerusalem

    Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin but that attack does
not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to
paint The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about
 In  however Eric Silver of The Guardian Britain
interviewed a survivor Mophammed Sammour who testified that  out
of a population of  were killed 'About three days after the
massacre' Sammour explained 'representatives of each of the five
clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a
list of the people who had not been found alive We went through the
names  Nothing has happend since  to make me think this figure
was wrong'

    Unlike the PLO's deliberate attacks on civilians the killing of
civilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated The attackers left open
an escape corridor from the village and more than  residents left
unharmed



why does this remind me of bosnia and ethnic cleansing 



tippu



 After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then fired
on the Jewish troops some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers and
civilians indiscriminately Independent observers told The Guardian
that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women

  Dear Mr Beyer
  
  It is never wise to confuse freedom of speech with freedom
  of racism and violent deragatory
  
  It is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial 
  distinction
 
 	In fact if a speach was not offensive to some its
 protection under Freedom of speach laws would be useless It is
 speach that some find questionable that must be protected be
 it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist It is only
 through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can
 enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant That is the
 idea behind freedom of expression
 	What you find offensive might be perceived as truth by
 some and what they might find offensive might be your belief
 It is only through free exchange of ideas and insults as the
 case seems to be with this channel that one can change
 another's erring waysThat is why Jefferson said that here 
 we are not afraid to tolerate error so long as reason is left to 
 combat it 

  Does this mean that YOU are volunteering to wade through the
  MutluArgic deluge that comes in every day  Some of us are
  tired of being dragged into contentfree pissing contests
  with reflexive bigots  We INTENSELY dislike being stuck between
  letting this crap pass without comment as though it were
  unremarkable and replying to it and getting sucked in again

  Let's keep some perspective here

  IMHO the Josh's policy of forwarding the garbage in question
  without comment to the relevant sysadmin strikes a good
  balance  The stuff was after all PUBLISHED on a public
  forum  from that very site yet  Hardly a matter of
  confidentiality or copyright  If the local administration
  wants to do something about it they have that right  If
  not nobody's twisting their arms

In igcapcorg cprigcapcorg Center for Political Reflux  wrote

  pseudoletterhead deleted  dcs

 While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto they
 repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
 attempt to starve the Gazans

  Why do I detect the faint scent of bias here  Could it be because
  the Israelis aren't feasting  Perhaps because the Gazans aren't
  starving

 The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population
 density in the world

  Oh oh  I hadn't realized that the Chinese had wiped out Hong
  Kong or that Singapore had sunk into the sea or that several
  other cities had vanished  Either that or this is a taste of
  the quality of 'Research' we're about to see

                       has been cut off from the world for weeks

  So I suppose that the footage on CNN last night was archival
  and Ted Turner was faking it after the NBC style  Or is this
  another wee little exaggeration for the sake of a Greater Truth

 The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
 Gaza some  people by denying them the right to leave the
 strip and seek work in Israel

  Hey  You forgot that Israel has also denied Syrians the same
  'right'  Come to think of it Mexico is denying me that 'right'
  evan as I write this  Or are you ever so gently suggesting that
  Israel unlike every other country on Earth shouldn't be allowed
  to control traffic across its borders

 While Polish nonJews risked their lives to save Jews from the
 Ghetto no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
 the Gazan resistance  The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
 Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

  This sounds like a parallel but it isn't  Tell us how many Poles
  went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there  Oops  For a moment
  there I forgot that in Poland 'humanitarian assistance could
  get you killed  Come to think of it humanitarian assistance to
  the Gazans can get Israelis killed too  Except that in Gaza
  it's likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office

  So let's keep the parallel  Since the gross numbers aren't the
  same we'll need a proportionality value  Should we use
     Gazan vs Jewish initial population
     Gazan vs Jewish death rates
     Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation
     Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'
     Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims
  Since the two cases are so comparable it shouldn't matter
  which we pick they'll all be about the same right



Contrary to popular hyperbole the IDF could quite easily kill
off the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to
No I'm not exaggerating  And I really don't want to discuss how
Note that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline
space than a dozen and are just as soon forgotten  and once
exterminated they can't keep popping up as headlines

So if a Final Solution for Gaza would be so much better from
a Realpolitik standpoint why doesn't Israel go for it  A
difficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything
good about Jews and probably why they keep trying to forcefit
the facts into the theory

I agree with all you write except that Terrorist orgs were not shelling
Israel from the Golan Heights in  but rather from Lebanon The Golan
Heights have been held by Israel since  and therefore the PLO could
not have been shelling Israel from there unless there is something I am
not aware of

Oopssmall mistake  Thanks for mentioning it  I just read on
theIsraelline that a village just got shelled by terrorists last week 
and some children were killed  I guess the terrorists must have gotten by
the security zone  Just think at how much more shelling would be 
happening if the security zone weren't there

intellectuals opposed to the heritage of Enlightenment


This is really a strange target for Martillo Malaysia has fully
vindicated itself since it shed its colonial yoke It is a legitimate
economic success story Its success may not be as dramatic  as Japan
and Singapore nevertheless it has fully vindicated itself So 
advocating Anglocolonialism is ludicrous for Malaysia Next I 
suppose you will be advocating recolonization of China which is 
probably experiencing one the greatest sustained economic booms in
the history of Mankind  
 
Do you think present day England is in a position to set the stage for any
more colonization  They will be lucky if they can keep intact what they
have  

With US assistance and proper agreements redeployment of the British
and French colonial empires would not be hard  Primitive rd world
elites who resist and who incite resistance among their deluded
brainwashed and essentially enslaved populations would get the Iraq
treatment


Dream on They are having problems even with deploying ground troops
in Bosnia Public opinion dictates that loss of lives even in 
miniscule quantities cannot be tolerated in the rich countries 
This is really wierd If you come to think of it the armed forces are
paid to basically to accept the risk of dying If that danger is removed 
it then has to be viewed as welfare on a grand scale But that is exactly
what the public is saying 

The Iraqi operation lead to an extraordinary low level of casualties
This is an anomaly A combination of Iraqi incompetence and desert terrain 
Any future operation would lead to more casualties For example the 
bombing in Beirut lead to more GI deaths than the whole of Desert Storm 
 
Do you really think that scum like Nehru ever asked themselves whether
the vast majority of Indians would be better off under British or
local rule  Nehru was driven by a crude desire for power
Nationalism was just the vehicle whereby Indian nationalists persuaded
a lot of poor deluded fools to die in order to give a small elite the
power to exploit other Indians


You obviously have some information that the rest of us are not
aware of Otherwise it is impossible to draw such outrageous conclusions

This issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of
just one reference probably won't resolve this issue to those that
oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed Even in your
location of this one reference you spend most of your quote dealing
with an incidence that while abhorrant has nothing to do with the 
issue at hand here Then at the end of the quote there is an almost
offhand comment that two mosques were destroyed

To support a claim of this nature what other authors support this
incident If identifiable mosques were destroyed they are certainly
identifiable they have names and addresses steet location The
comment by one reporter does make us wonder if this happened but
by no means proves it

There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of
mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall That does not mean
however that once can generalize from this to any other points  The
entire plaza mosques and all was cleared to make it possible for Jews
to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of
them and which had been denied to them for millenia

On the other hand throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel to the
best of my knowledge Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided
damage to any Islamic religious sites This contrasts with the policies
of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and
bigotry

It is important to note that there remains at least one mosque in the
Jewish quarter of the Old City at least according to my map  You
might be able to find it just north of the Hurva synagogue  Is this
mosque really still there  Was this mosque built by squatters too

When I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago our guide told
us the story of that mosque  not sure if it was true

Apparently it was built by a Jewish convert to Islam  He had
had a dispute with his neighbours and built the mosque davka to
annoy them  It's a cute story but not sure if it's true

I believe that Zionism as it is is a form of racism By as it is I mean
not the fact that is nacionalism but the specific ideas it supports the
form it defines what a Jew is and the way it wants to accomplish its goals
It has nothing to do with hypocrisy

It has everything to do with hypocrisy  We've dealt with with your
arguments about history before on this net  suffice it to say you
haven't succeeded in convincing anyone  probably because of their lack
of basis  

I do not want to convince anyone This is just USENET not the real
world I just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes
I present my opinion I think that this net is only useful to exchange
ideas I never wanted nor I want now to convince anyone of anything


Now if you want to deal with what certain people say that
is fine  But by condemning the movement  which is NOTHING more than
Jewish nationalism and NEVER HAS BEEN anything more than that  you are
saying  quite literally  that it is racist to think that Jews  your
own people it should be added  have the right to a state in their
homeland the same right every other nation has  If you don't agree
with that I suggest you read a dictionary  Because your interpretation
is just plain inconsistent with that dictionary definition as well as
modern history

First and I repeat it I never said that the idea of Jews having the
right to have a State is racist
Zionism as a movement is more than just that idea I think that Zionism
in the way it defines who is a Jew for example is racistlike
In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do
not support the bombing and killing of the IRA I believe that Jews have
a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right now



Here's where you're wrong  Here's also where you should know you're
wrong  Zionism is in no way monolithic  Never has been  Approaches to
Zionism are as widespread as the ideologies of Hashomer Hatzair and Meir
Kahane  Some of those approaches ARE racist  Kahane for one  But
every approach to Zionism defines those goals differently and also
defines a different approach to those goals  The single commonality is
the belief that Jews like every other nation on Earth deserve their
own homeland  PERIOD  

That is what makes the basis for Zionist movements However I am not 
considering just that but the rest of it 


 As long as Zionism considers for
example who is a Jew in a Jewish State based on religion I will consider
Zionism a form of Racism

As you well know over  of Israeli Jews are secular  in other words
they are in no way religious and most probably don't even believe in Gd

Which makes an interesting point People living in a Jewish State have
shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are
not the same So the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown 
us that there are some problems in a State where  of the people is secular
but Judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage
is a religious stage or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to
a religious standard
Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become 
nonJews Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a 
religious definition



Maybe I would consider hypocrisy to support Zionism and disregard the 
right to selfdetermination of the Palestinian people and their struggle to
reach it

If you'd wanted to say that in the first place you should have said it
then  I took you at your word  In other words I took your words to
have their normal dictionary definition  It is now quite obvious that
you use a different dictionary than the rest of the Englishspeaking
world and that you base your analysis on misconceptions


According to Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary MerriamWebster Inc
Publishers Springfield Massachusetts USA  page  

hypocrisy A feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not

So saying that one believes in Zionism as a simple matter of people 
having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the Palestinian
people to do the same according to this dictionary is hypocrisy


If you are really interested on what I think instead of directly coming with 
labels like hypocrat send me a mail to aapwamumdedu and we can
exchange ideas

How about learning what your words mean for once  I stand by what I've
said

I know what my words mean I do stand by what I said I believe Zionism is
a form of racism Of course I tend to talk about things as they are and
not as they are defined in a broad sense

AS	Even though the point of your article seemed to be to flame I
AS felt I should point out that the lions share of US foreign aid goes to
AS Germany where the US stationed a hundered thousand troops for 
AS years while the Germans kicked our economic collective ass  The
AS money that goes to Israel is miniscule compared to what goes to
AS Germany
 
WHAT AN EVASIVE COMPARISON US troops stationed in Germany or
anywhere else is the world is not Foreign Aid numbnuts Are you
sure you're not a closet Holocaust Revisionist Adam I have a
suggestion for you Write to your congressman or senator and ask him
or her for the official definition of Foreign Aid and just who are
the recipients of such Israel is DEFINITELY on the top of the heap
no matter how you try to twist the truth

Why don't you pull your head out of your ass and into reality  First off what
is the deal with your subject lines Do you think that you are being funny
Ha ha  What a developed sense of humor you have I'm surprised they let you 
out of the cage  Why don't we not talk about the official definition of
foreign aid and talk about where money is really spent  More money is spent
stationing troops in Germany ie paying the troops maintaining bases and equip
etc than in Israel  Plus Israel does not ask the US to send troops to fight
her battles  If you look at the amount of money spent defending Korean 
shipping lanes Norway and other trouble spots in the world you will see that
aid to Israel  from a practical standpoint  is not that much  And so what 
so what if Israel gets the most assuming I buy your feeble argument  What 
is your point  Do you not want to subsidize Israel  Well you have two options
 Start your own campaign get elected as president and then force congress
to cut all aid to Israel or  get the fuck out  If  you don't like how this 
country operates and can't change it then move to Iran or something

All my love

 p  second paragraph

 I had received further very definite information of horrors that
  had been committed by the Armenian soldiery in Kars Plain and as 
  I had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their 
  treatment of my own detached parties I had wired to Tiflis from 
  Zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the Armenians should not 
  be left in independent command of the Moslem population as their 
  troops being without discipline and not under effective control 
  atrocities were constantly being committed for which we should 
  with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible'

 ADVENTURES IN THE NEAR EAST

disposal for our journey I foresaw it would have to become
our headquarters for a considerable time and therefore went
to some trouble to make it habitable We had a most peculiar
little locomotive originally built in America for the Russian
Government adapted to burn either wood or oil one covered
truck as men's quarters one similar which I fitted up for my
self and a railway officer and also a truck to carry wood three
cars being the utmost our small engine could pull With this
small outfit we started rumours of all kinds reaching us before
our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly
coming to a head it being evident that the Turks were becoming
more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of
the Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the
future

Travelling on this little wartime railway was indeed an
experience and it was necessary to carry a gauge and to
test the rails with it frequently for in many places owing to
the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the
ballast the rails required rectification before we were able to
get our train over even at a foot pace each bridge also re
quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon
it and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim
ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts
whilst we passed over them

Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog
ress was by no means rapid and as we had frequently to halt
also to replenish our supply of wood fuel we considered we
had achieved wonders when on the evening of the second day
 hours and  miles out from Erzeroum we finally entered the
gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles
to lie This is the same gorge into which the road from
Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foothills to cross the
frontier the railway however follows the main Aras River val
ley till the frontier gorge enters it whilst the road cuts off the
corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin
some  miles from the main valley

Soon after entering the gorge we were confronted by the
first serious fall of rockabout  tons having fallen from
the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track Here
therefore we halted and sending our engine back prepared to

I'll leave questions  and  to be answered elsewhere but on question 
something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be
Namely that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to 
establish a police force for Haiti

I didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt of Haiti asked for it
nor is there any real precedent barring Somalia for the UN getting involved
in internal conflicts

That might also answer question  The neocolonial countries are a diffuse
lot  the UN Security Council

And while I am at it I'll take a stab at   the new colonialism as defined in
most articles I have read would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship
under the UN Sec Council democracy aid education freemarkets free press
and then out for the colonialists now assured that there is a civilized 
country that they have left behind

Note I don't support this idealized concept simply because I think it is a
lot of hogwash

In article sloeagcvillesrvwamumdedu aapwamumdedu Alberto Adolfo Pinkas writes

I do not want to convince anyone This is just USENET not the real
world I just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes
I present my opinion I think that this net is only useful to exchange
ideas I never wanted nor I want now to convince anyone of anything

Fine  Now if your opinion isn't convincing anyone and it's getting
refuted regularly by the facts which is the case isn't it likely that
your opinions need some revision

As I said I do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions
convince anyone
I do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts


First and I repeat it I never said that the idea of Jews having the
right to have a State is racist
Zionism as a movement is more than just that idea

In a word  utter and complete horse puckey  Look the term up in the
dictionary

Maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here One thing is the
accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely
different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time



 I think that Zionism
in the way it defines who is a Jew for example is racistlike

OK now how would YOU define it  And by the way you're wrong again
There is NO uniformity of this definition among Zionist movements
You know this is the case it's been pointed out on the net directly to
you before and yet you continue to maintain this delusion

OK Tell me how many people in Zionist movements define a Jew in a 
different way and how many are who define Jew based on a religious way

In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do
not support the bombing and killing of the IRA I believe that Jews have
a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right now

Comparing the actions of Israel to that of the IRA is like comparing
those of the US to those of Chile under Pinochet for example with the
IRA in the role of Pinochet  You really need to get your history
straight  You also need a basic dictionary

You need to start reading before answering 
My point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it 
does not mean that I consider it to be nationalistic I did not comapre
Israel to the IRA I think that you are starting to put words on my 
mouth and that is wrong



Stuff deleted by Pinkas  His statement which I was responding to
with the below asserted that Zionism was uniform and monolithic

I never said that Zionism is monolithic If you are going to attribute
me things present the quotes where I said that


That is what makes the basis for Zionist movements However I am not 
considering just that but the rest of it 

In a word  I don't believe you  Your words tell a very different
story  Especially since they are not based on fact but innuendo and
misrepresentation 

That is your problem I could certainly interpret this like you are 
running out of arguments First you put words in my mouth now you
say you do ot believe me


Which makes an interesting point People living in a Jewish State have
shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are
not the same So the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown 
us that there are some problems in a State where  of the people is secular
but Judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage
is a religious stage or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to
a religious standard

No it doesn't  Nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be
religious or even believe in Gd to become a citizen of Israel
thereunder  

Why don't you try reading for a change Did I say that the Law of Return
demand a person to be religious Now how does the Law of Return define 
who is a Jew and who is not I said that it uses a religious standard
If your mother is a Jew you are a Jew if your mother is not Jewish
neither you are
Do not twist my words please


True there are debates in Israel and abroad about who is
a Jew but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular
Would you say that religious people should not have a say in that
Would you deny them their right of free speech

I am not talking about the debate I am talking about how things are right
now When the debate is over I'll see what happens
Right now things are like they are
Let me ask you one thing I understand that Israel differenciates between
Citizenship and Nationality Suppose Male and Female have a child in
Israel Which nationality will the child's ID show according to each one
of the following cases

a F and M are both Jewish
b F is Jewsh and M is not
c F is Muslim and M is jewish
d F is Christian and M is Jewish
e F and M are both nonJewish




Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become 
nonJews Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a 
religious definition

It's called history  How do you think Jews stuck together through
pogroms for millenia in Europe  We had to know who was our own  I for
one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent
is no less legit than is matrilineal which is NOT the religious Jew's
point of view  There's plenty of room for that in Zionism  as you
well know

It called history At some point it was OK Now I believe it is not 


According to Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary MerriamWebster Inc
Publishers Springfield Massachusetts USA  page  

hypocrisy A feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not

So saying that one believes in Zionism as a simple matter of people 
having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the Palestinian
people to do the same according to this dictionary is hypocrisy

Utter baloney  By the way I do believe the Palestinians have a right
to selfdetermination have stated so on this net and I know you've
                                                        
seen it  
 

Interesting How do you know Had I ever talked to you about this and 
forgotten about that

But that right to selfdetermination cannot be at Israel's
expense  Israel's security comes first and that security must be
maintained  You're also twisting words now beyond belief  If you think
that's what that definition means in this context you need a firstgrade 
course in English


Which definition are you now talking here about 
I do not know why you are so touchy I never said that you did not support
Palestinian selfdetermination I just gave an example of hypocrisy I never
said that someone in this net is guilty of it It was just an example Nothing
more nothing less than that Why did you have to clarify what you think

If you didn't use different meanings of words than are in the
dictionary you might be believable  

Here you have several problems
First you should know that words have more meanings than those given in
the dictionary
Second it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more
words than those in the dictionary
Third we can exchange ideas if you want but you come out with this nonsense
about being believable  using the definitions given in a dictionary
It seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting
others Sad

If your facts at all resembled
even the slightest bit of truth  which they do not  you might be 
believable  

If you did not put words in my mouth it might be that you might
start reading what I had actually said So far you come over and over
twisting what I said or presenting things I never said as if I had said
them In this way you are answering to yourself That is why you do not
find it believable Maybe if you start reading what I had actually said
and not what you added you might change your mind

But the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in
what you've said on this thread  And the fact also is that you're using
different definitions for your words  based on baloney  than anyone
else does

First there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what I said
as if I had said it 
Seconf anyone else is supposed to mean than I do

To Eric S Perlman perlmanqsoColoradoEDU
 
Your posts make a good case study for an unashamed misanthrope
Instead of attempting to enlightening Pinkas about the errors of his
ways and EVEN after he politely asked you to continue the debate in
email you persist in publicly lambasting him and labeling him a
hypocryte

Your posts not mine fit this description  What was the very first
thing you did upon entering this newsgroup  Treat everyone who didn't
agree with your opinions as dirt not explain to them why call them
very rude names twist words for flames need I go on

I can defend myself quite well against Pinkas thank you

There is nothing you need to defend yourself against As I said
I just exchange ideas over the USENET with other people I never 
attacked you as to put you in the need to defend yourself against me
I am not a violent person and I do not see how can anyone be threatened
by the opinions and ideas of others as expressed on USENET
I asked you to continue on email because I am not interested on a
flamefest where you change my words or just make up some of your own
and present them as mine
So do not worry You do not need to defend yourself because I am not
attacking you

Next time you try making such
comments try some basic civility and you might get somewhere

This is a good advice for yourself

for your information on Israel  Since I read both American media
and Israeli media I can say with absolute certainty that anybody
who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about
Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on

Of course you never read Arab media

I read Arab ISRAELI Jer Post and this network is more than enough

The Jerusalem Post is only a small part of the Israeli media  One
that caters to outsiders for the most part anyways

If you never read Ha'aretz Maariv or other Hebrew langauge papers
 or at least seen some of their articles translated you are not
really getting the Israeli media





and Western American French and British reports and I can say
that if we give Israel  and Arabs  on the bias scale of course
you can switch the polarities Israeli newspapers will get either
a  or  American leading  newspapers and TV news range from 

Inlcuding some of the leftleaning ones


to  yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis

A  to a  Is that why stations such as PBS have run shows which
do not depict the Israeli standpoint at all

IS that why the Intifada got more coverage in  and  than did
Saddamn gassing Kurds by the thousands




The Montreal suburban a local free newspaper probably is closer
to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers British

I am from Montreal I read the Suburban Did they ever advocate the
Kahane stupidity of expelling the Arabs Are they racist

The Suburban has some columnists that explain the Israeli standpoint

They are nothing like Kahane IN any case the Suburban is a paper
with a minor local distribution and no influence



range from  neutral to  French that Iknow of of course range
from  Afrofrench magazines to  Arab official media range from
 to  Egyptian  to  in SA Why no  Because they do not want to
overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since 
they are doing nothing

 
   As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased of course they
are  Some may lean to the right or the left just like the media
here in America  But they still report events about which people
here know nothing  I choose to form my opinions about Israel and
the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American
who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report
on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy

the average bias of what you read would be probably around 
while that of the average American would be the same if they do
not read or read the newyork times and similar Newsmakers and
 if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased newspapers

so you are not better off


So what source is the closest thing to a zero

There are basically three alternatives for Gaza

  To throw the Jews to the sea that is basically to make them leave

  To throw the Gazans into the sea in accordance with Yitzhak Rabin's
     wish and that of many Zionists

 Rabin is the PM Did he ever indicate such a wish Try to implement it



  For Israelis and Palestinians to come to an honorable and fair I

In a word  utter and complete horse puckey  Look the term up in the
dictionary


OK Lets look into this
According to my dictionary
Zionism an international movement orig for the establishment of a Jewish
national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of
modern Israel

Now I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious 
principles while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural
identities

So Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer My point
is what someone said long time ago In politics like with men it is important
to distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually
doing

 My mother is Jewish and so is my father If I apply for the Law of
Return do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land from which my
family was expelled about  years ago
 If I go back which nationality would my ID show
 If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been 
expelled  years ago but first I convert to any other religion can I 
apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I 
apply as someone whose mother is Jewish
 Which nationality would show my ID in case 
 What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted
to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation
 Suppose I want to get married to my current wife who is nonJewish in
Israel how do I do it
 How would my situation change if I decided after going back to
Israel to convert to Islam


Now here is one more question I do believe that most people in a country
do not care about politics They just want to be left alone
Suppose my father is Arab Suppose he was born in Palestine in some place 
which now is part of Israel Suppose that his father and his grandfather as
well as  or  generations before him were born in that place
Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father scared by all the
fighting going on tries to take his family to a place more secure among 
people he knows who speak a language he understands who worship the same
god Now suppose that that place is some other Arab country 
And now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created
where my father used to live and that that country is called Israel
And that in that country Jews from all over the world are received And
that people whose family left thet country  generation ago are recieved and
granted fullcitizenship
Should I if I decided to go back to my father's land where he was born as
 or  generations of my family were born have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 
years

Then finally people ask me how I would define a Jew but that is irrelevant
I am not talking about how I would define a Jew but about how people in 
Zionist organizations and more important in Israel define a Jew
How would those who are Zionist define a Jew

I do not want to convince anyone This is just USENET not the real
world I just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes
I present my opinion I think that this net is only useful to exchange
ideas I never wanted nor I want now to convince anyone of anything

Fine  Now if your opinion isn't convincing anyone and it's getting
refuted regularly by the facts which is the case isn't it likely that
your opinions need some revision

As I said I do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions
convince anyone
I do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts

Then you haven't been paying attention to the arguments levelled against
them They have been over and over again  They will be again

First and I repeat it I never said that the idea of Jews having the
right to have a State is racist
Zionism as a movement is more than just that idea

In a word  utter and complete horse puckey  Look the term up in the
dictionary

Maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here One thing is the
accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely
different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time

Hey what do you think dictionaries are for  You quite obviously need
one  A good dictionary gives both and you well know it

 I think that Zionism
in the way it defines who is a Jew for example is racistlike

OK now how would YOU define it  And by the way you're wrong again
There is NO uniformity of this definition among Zionist movements
You know this is the case it's been pointed out on the net directly to
you before and yet you continue to maintain this delusion

OK Tell me how many people in Zionist movements define a Jew in a 
different way and how many are who define Jew based on a religious way

I don't think that data exist on this directly

In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do
not support the bombing and killing of the IRA I believe that Jews have
a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right now

Comparing the actions of Israel to that of the IRA is like comparing
those of the US to those of Chile under Pinochet for example with the
IRA in the role of Pinochet  You really need to get your history
straight  You also need a basic dictionary

You need to start reading before answering 
My point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it 
does not mean that I consider it to be nationalistic I did not comapre
Israel to the IRA I think that you are starting to put words on my 
mouth and that is wrong

That is no problem  But once again you are defining Zionism as ONE
movement  You are implying that it is monolithic  You KNOW this is
not and has never been the case

Stuff deleted by Pinkas  His statement which I was responding to
with the below asserted that Zionism was uniform and monolithic

I never said that Zionism is monolithic If you are going to attribute
me things present the quotes where I said that

You don't say it directly  You implied it and I showed explicitly
where and how you implied it  Now you're trying to wriggle out of it
Won't wash and you know it

That is what makes the basis for Zionist movements However I am not 
considering just that but the rest of it 

In a word  I don't believe you  Your words tell a very different
story  Especially since they are not based on fact but innuendo and
misrepresentation 

That is your problem I could certainly interpret this like you are 
running out of arguments First you put words in my mouth now you
say you do ot believe me

It's you not me who is running out of arguments  

Which makes an interesting point People living in a Jewish State have
shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are
not the same So the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown 
us that there are some problems in a State where  of the people is secular
but Judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage
is a religious stage or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to
a religious standard

No it doesn't  Nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be
religious or even believe in Gd to become a citizen of Israel
thereunder  

Why don't you try reading for a change Did I say that the Law of Return
demand a person to be religious Now how does the Law of Return define 
who is a Jew and who is not I said that it uses a religious standard
If your mother is a Jew you are a Jew if your mother is not Jewish
neither you are
Do not twist my words please

What you said is that Judaism is defined according to religious
standards  Now this can have several different meanings and you know
it  One of the meanings that it can have is to say that Only those who
are religious are defined as Jews  Another is to say that Only those
who meet the religious definition of a Jew is one  And there are
others  I'm not twisting your words  I'm trying to make you aware that
your words don't mean what you think they do

True there are debates in Israel and abroad about who is
a Jew but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular
Would you say that religious people should not have a say in that
Would you deny them their right of free speech

I am not talking about the debate I am talking about how things are right
now When the debate is over I'll see what happens
Right now things are like they are
Let me ask you one thing I understand that Israel differenciates between
Citizenship and Nationality Suppose Male and Female have a child in
Israel Which nationality will the child's ID show according to each one
of the following cases

Actually it doesn't  And the citizens' rights are exactly THE SAME in
both cases anyway

a F and M are both Jewish

Jewish

b F is Jewsh and M is not

Jewish

c F is Muslim and M is jewish
d F is Christian and M is Jewish

It'll depend on what religion is practiced in the house  The original
law of return would still admit such a person if they were Jewish if
memory serves

e F and M are both nonJewish

Not Jewish


Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become 
nonJews Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a 
religious definition

It's called history  How do you think Jews stuck together through
pogroms for millenia in Europe  We had to know who was our own  I for
one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent
is no less legit than is matrilineal which is NOT the religious Jew's
point of view  There's plenty of room for that in Zionism  as you
well know

It called history At some point it was OK Now I believe it is not 

That's valid as far as I can see

According to Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary MerriamWebster Inc
Publishers Springfield Massachusetts USA  page  

hypocrisy A feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not

So saying that one believes in Zionism as a simple matter of people 
having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the Palestinian
people to do the same according to this dictionary is hypocrisy

Utter baloney  By the way I do believe the Palestinians have a right
to selfdetermination have stated so on this net and I know you've
                                                        
seen it  
 

Interesting How do you know Had I ever talked to you about this and 
forgotten about that

More than once  As have others

But that right to selfdetermination cannot be at Israel's
expense  Israel's security comes first and that security must be
maintained  You're also twisting words now beyond belief  If you think
that's what that definition means in this context you need a firstgrade 
course in English


Which definition are you now talking here about 

The very one you give above  It is absolutely inconsistent with the
twist you put on it  

I do not know why you are so touchy I never said that you did not support
Palestinian selfdetermination I just gave an example of hypocrisy

No you didn't  You had to twist the definition of the word  degrees
in order to do so and everyone else knows it  I'm not being touchy

 I never
said that someone in this net is guilty of it It was just an example Nothing
more nothing less than that Why did you have to clarify what you think

Because what you gave WAS NOT an example  IT WAS an example of how
the definition of a word can be twisted around  degrees  

If you didn't use different meanings of words than are in the
dictionary you might be believable  

Here you have several problems
First you should know that words have more meanings than those given in
the dictionary

Oh so now what are dictionaries for

Second it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more
words than those in the dictionary

Duh  As a scientist whose technical terms are very often not found in
common dictionaries I know this  But when a term is common like
hypocrisy a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source

Third we can exchange ideas if you want but you come out with this nonsense
about being believable  using the definitions given in a dictionary

It's not nonsense  When people read what you write they have to try to
associate a meaning to those words  Dictionaries give the meanings of
words don't they  Now I assume that you'd like to have the words you
use mean what you'd like them to  But the fact is you're using very
different meanings than are in the dictionary or you would like the
reader to assign them new meanings which they never had  

It seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting
others Sad

Not at all  What I cannot abide is utter bombast when you've been
proven completely wrong

If your facts at all resembled
even the slightest bit of truth  which they do not  you might be 
believable  

If you did not put words in my mouth it might be that you might
start reading what I had actually said

I never put even one syllable in your mouth  You have tried to prove
this and you failed  

 So far you come over and over
twisting what I said or presenting things I never said as if I had said
them 

Poppycock

In this way you are answering to yourself That is why you do not
find it believable Maybe if you start reading what I had actually said
and not what you added you might change your mind

I read what you said  I did not add anything  You simply either don't
know that the words don't mean what you'd like them to  which cannot be
the case now since you've been proven wrong and you quite obviously
don't have a defense against the arguments presented or you're twisting
the meanings  Which is it

But the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in
what you've said on this thread  And the fact also is that you're using
different definitions for your words  based on baloney  than anyone
else does

First there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what I said
as if I had said it 

Ha  There's nothing resembling fact in what you've said  I NEVER added
ANYTHING to what you said

 If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been 
expelled  years ago but first I convert to any other religion can I 
apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I 
apply as someone whose mother is Jewish

I'm not sure about this but I hope the answer is that you can't apply under
the law of return  By conversion you've elected not to be a part of the
Jewish nation


 What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted
to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation

At the moment you converted you officially anounced to the world that you do not
consider yourself to be part of the Jewish Nation  So why should the Jewish Nation
consider you to be a member


Suppose my father is Arab Suppose he was born in Palestine in some place 
which now is part of Israel Suppose that his father and his grandfather as
well as  or  generations before him were born in that place
Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father scared by all the
fighting going on tries to take his family to a place more secure among 
people he knows who speak a language he understands who worship the same
god Now suppose that that place is some other Arab country 
And now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created
where my father used to live and that that country is called Israel
And that in that country Jews from all over the world are received And
that people whose family left thet country  generation ago are recieved and
granted fullcitizenship
Should I if I decided to go back to my father's land where he was born as
 or  generations of my family were born have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 
years

No  As a result of wars brought by the Arabs against the Jews in an attempt to
annihilate Israel the Arabs have lost their claim to land there  Attacking Israel
iswas illegal and they now have to pay the price  Do I feel sorry for the
Palestinians  Yes I do  But I blame the Arab nations for their problems not
Israel

There is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit

that the roots of old colonial attitudes lie Today the motives are noble
Tomorrow they may not be

Who ever said people who commit genocide have the right to commit genocide  
I want a world where criminals agains humanity have no place to hide while you 
want special sovereignties designed to protect them  Nobody has the right to 
commit crimes against humanity and if they do they loose all right to self 
determination  If this is classical colonialism then so be it

Hey what do you think dictionaries are for  You quite obviously need

I could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue Spanish that
are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary Even more I
could show you a lot of meanings that words in Spanish have different
from those in the dictionary

OK Tell me how many people in Zionist movements define a Jew in a 
different way and how many are who define Jew based on a religious way

I don't think that data exist on this directly

And guess why Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define 
in how many different ways the term Jew which is the basis of the movement 
itself
So the evidence shows that up to now Jew when considered in terms of Israel
the Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and
not of cultural identity even if  of those defined as Jews in Isreal
are not religious



In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do

That IS a problem I am saying that I do not support Zionism as it is
now I believe that among the people in the Soviet Communist Party some
might even had been inspired by noble ideals Does that change the
final results of what happened in the USSR
In the same way even if the Zionist movement is not homogeneous it
does not matter What matters is the result

I never said that Zionism is monolithic If you are going to attribute
me things present the quotes where I said that

You don't say it directly  You implied it and I showed explicitly
where and how you implied it  Now you're trying to wriggle out of it
Won't wash and you know it

I never said it directly nor indirectly I am not talking about individuals
who defined themselves as zionists here I am sure most of them are good
honest and caring people I am talking about the results of the Zionist
Movement I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a
Law of Return with a religious definition of Jew a country that defines
nationality based on religion I am talking about something I consider
a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief 
After all if Arabs in Israel cannot serve in the Army is becasue they 
were not born in the right religion


What you said is that Judaism is defined according to religious
standards  Now this can have several different meanings and you know

I had never heard the definition Only those who are religious are defined as Jews
I had always seen the definition A person is a Jew is hisher mother iswas
a Jew and if such person does not convert although I had seen people
argue about the last part


I am not talking about the debate I am talking about how things are right
now When the debate is over I'll see what happens

No you didn't  You had to twist the definition of the word  degrees
in order to do so and everyone else knows it  I'm not being touchy

You do not need to assume the representation of everybody else to 
make your points You should assume that you are just talking for yourself
About the other stuff I still believe that the example was a valid one
It would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and
then support Zionism and then disregard the Palestinian's right


 I never
said that someone in this net is guilty of it It was just an example Nothing

yes but not all of them A language is something that evolves all the time


It seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting

Not at all  What I cannot abide is utter bombast when you've been
proven completely wrong

Not really I posted in another post the definition of Zionism And in
this post you have showed for me what I was telling you from the 
begining Zionism is a form of racism even if most zionists are not
racist in their individual and private lifes A movement that ask
for a State and National rights for a people and then in practice
that people are defined according to religion is for me racistlike



I never put even one syllable in your mouth  You have tried to prove
this and you failed  

You did it Next time be more careful

Ha  There's nothing resembling fact in what you've said  I NEVER added
ANYTHING to what you said

Do you know the difference between opinion and fact

Well let's delve one level deeper Why is democracy better than tribalism or
other means of Govt The President of Georgia was elected with a thumping
majority and booted out later w no objections from the UN Similarly the
people of Algeria elected an Islamic Fundemantalist Party into power but the
junta declared it illegal In both cases I personally have no problems with
the outcome but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the 
world community claims to revere so why isn't it interfering there 

 the US or any other democracy wishes to they are in the perfect right to 
 help them without any whining from thir parties  After all if it turns out to 
 be colonialism and the poeple don't like it they' find a way to throw them out

Exactly My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way and we can save
ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their
problems on their own Colonial interventions even in Haiti haven't worked 
in the past They had a  coups from  The US invaded in  And left
in  almost  years after they had intended to Was it a success Well
look at Haiti today and of the past  years and decide for yourself It was
a success so long as the US was in from what I remember But it didn't last
long obviously

 There is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit
 in judgement of another people and to then act on it To me it is in there
 that the roots of old colonial attitudes lie Today the motives are noble
 Tomorrow they may not be
 
 Who ever said people who commit genocide have the right to commit genocide 

Nobody did People should have a right to selfdefense If the UN wants to arm
the Bosnians or Haitian revolutionaries or whoever I have no problems with
that I do when they cross that line and attempt to rearrange boundaries govts
etc the VanceOwen plan being one such piece of insanity
 
 I want a world where criminals agains humanity have no place to hide while you 
 want special sovereignties designed to protect them  Nobody has the right to 
 commit crimes against humanity and if they do they loose all right to self 
 determination  If this is classical colonialism then so be it

We finally have a clearlystated point of difference Colonialism can
have its good side which is as you stated above  removing thugs from being
able to lord it over powerless people I am worried that the bad side is what 
will assert itself and I am prepared to let natural forces take their course 
if that will mean we can avoid the bad side of colonialism

Thanks for posting the references I do not normally read tpm
and I posted my request for references because Jim's article
was crossposted to socculturejewish Allegations of Jewish
disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are
one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture and
rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms
than blood libel The stereotypes that pervade our culture create
cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes Therefore any
claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by
decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented
If such a claim is crossposted to a news group in which it has
not been documented before such as scj a reference should be
given the first time it appears  Now that the claim has been
documented I regard the whole episode as disgusting and
shameful Especially so because the official who failed to
provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians
was probably Jewish and as a Jew I know that he should have
known better

 If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been 
expelled  years ago but first I convert to any other religion can I 
apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I 
apply as someone whose mother is Jewish

I'm not sure about this but I hope the answer is that you can't apply under
the law of return  By conversion you've elected not to be a part of the
Jewish nation


Which was my point By converting to another religion I do not loose
my cultural identity I just loose my religious identification
I consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the 
right to have a State based on religious belief is a form of racism


 What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted
to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation

At the moment you converted you officially anounced to the world that you do not
consider yourself to be part of the Jewish Nation  So why should the Jewish Nation
consider you to be a member

To be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not
by my religion Actually if I am an atheist which is in fact like 
converting into a nonJewish in terms of religion I am still considered as
part of the Jewish Nation
I can be proud of my Jewish culture while not giving any importance to the
Jewish religion Or even more I can be proud of my Jewish culture while
still be convinced that the real god is another one
I do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the American nation 
because he changed of god


Suppose my father is Arab Suppose he was born in Palestine in some place 
which now is part of Israel Suppose that his father and his grandfather as
well as  or  generations before him were born in that place
Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father scared by all the
fighting going on tries to take his family to a place more secure among 
people he knows who speak a language he understands who worship the same
god Now suppose that that place is some other Arab country 
And now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created
where my father used to live and that that country is called Israel
And that in that country Jews from all over the world are received And
that people whose family left thet country  generation ago are recieved and
granted fullcitizenship
Should I if I decided to go back to my father's land where he was born as
 or  generations of my family were born have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 
years

No  As a result of wars brought by the Arabs against the Jews in an attempt to
annihilate Israel the Arabs have lost their claim to land there  Attacking Israel
iswas illegal and they now have to pay the price  Do I feel sorry for the
Palestinians  Yes I do  But I blame the Arab nations for their problems not
Israel

I still believe that we should never confusse the actions of States with
the individuals who happen to live there
In the same way that I do not think it is right to blame all Israelis for the
human rights violations of Israel I do not think that we should assume
that all Arabs are guilty of the actions of the Arab States
Some people fled their homes because they were scared Now they are in
there still suffering for what they are not responsible
And remember that we also were told the same at some point We ended in
the diaspora And of course I am not for doing to others what I did not
want done to me

Well I've been reading tpm for a while and here is what I saw
YOU write

In article EGGERTJMaymosesllmitedu you wrote

  For balance perhaps you should mention the mosques in Jerusalem that
  were razed after the Israeli victory in   An eye for an eye I guess

Your statment clearly tries to balance Arab atrocities by noting a
single incident by the Israelis in wartime at their most holy site
You even characterize it as an eye for an eye  

You also wrote

  That would be false  If you read your history you will learn that
  right after the  war the victorious Israelis decided to raze a
  section of the newly captured East Jerusalem near the Wailing Wall
  It is in this section that mosques were razed

so now you have to find some source that notes that more than  mosque
was razed  You then followed it with

  This episode is an example of a good government running amok with
  newly acquired power  

Really  Do you still feel that Israelis are comparable in the running
amok with power with say the Iraqis  Your eye for an eye
comparisons don't match the realities that most of us are familiar
with

Quoting from The West Bank Story pages 
On the night of June  an Israeli officer marched from door to door

This happened to be during a war  And a fierce and mighty war it was
too  Would you say that the Jordanians indiscriminately shot up
ancient structures as is their custom in describing bullet holes in
the walls of the city  This was war  It was certainly not any eye
for an eye characterstic  Israelis do not harbor the same feelings
of revenge as the Arabs generally do  This is one of the reasons that
the Peace Now movement exists in Israel and nowhere else in the ME

That's your opinion of course If we were to take your military
budget definition of Foreign Aid then the Foreign Aid we send
annually to Israel is easily multiplied beyond the three to six
depending on whose figures you believe million of hardearned US
taxpayer's dollars

Oh really  Let's see  It costs the US Armed forces roughly K in
salaries for the average man or woman in uniform  Normally it takes 
times the actual salary amount to support a worker  Thus for the
roughly K soldiers currently stationed in Germany we get nearly 
billion dollars  more than the annual cost of ALL aid to Israel  in
personnel not even counting what is spent on local workers and
equipment

You're just beginning to scratch the surface  Do you know how much
military equipment costs  When was the last time you tried to buy a
milspec hammer coffeepot or toilet seat  

Paying Israel to do the dirty work on it's own without putting
American soldiers's lives on the line is much much much cheaper than
Uncle Sam's arrangements with much of the rest of the world

It is important to note that there remains at least one mosque in the
Jewish quarter of the Old City at least according to my map  You
might be able to find it just north of the Hurva synagogue  Is this
mosque really still there  

Yes it is  I have taken photos of it's minaret

Was this mosque built by squatters too

Dunno

One should compare this treatment with the one given synagogues in the
Jewish quarter in  when it fell under Arab dominion   of the
 synagogues were burned down by mobs and the other  were razed by
the Jordanian army  I think that in comparison the Israelis have done
an excellent but certainly not perfect job at maintaining Arab
mosques

This doesn't sound like eye for an eye anymore  Changed your tune

When I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago our guide told
us the story of that mosque  not sure if it was true

Apparently it was built by a Jewish convert to Islam  He had
had a dispute with his neighbours and built the mosque davka to
annoy them  It's a cute story but not sure if it's true

If he gives you the same story explaining the presence of several
synagogues in the Moslem Quarter then the story becomes suspect

In reality the Old City was not as neighborhooded in the past as it
became after   In preIsrael Jerusalem there were many Jews in
what is now called the Moslem Quarter  There are postal and telephone
directories from that time to prove it  It's really rather
interesting to hear Arabs there claim that a house or store has been
in the family for centuries even when there are clear photos and
documents that show a Jewishowned business at the same location just
a few decades ago

Alberto you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings  You are now making the exact point
that I've made several times but with a different definition of religion  You don't not
have to believe in the religious aspects of Judaism to be a Jew this would confine
Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity  So by converting out of
Judaism I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism  I mean voluntarily
removing yourself from the Jewish nation  I am an agnostic but still consider myself
Jewish because of my cultural heritage  I admit that many religious jews would argue
that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith but Judaism is a religion of
dissent and debate isn't it  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by
converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the least racist and most
open nation  We have no quotas

So I will once again make my point  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion
not as you say religious belief is NOT racism  You come to your incorrect conclusion
because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and
when you define judaism

DEPOSITION OF KARINE BORISOVNA MELKUMIAN 

Born 
Teacher
Boarding School No 

Resident at Building B Apartment 
Block A
Sumgait Azerbaijan

This is my fate I had everything we were a happy family and now at 
I've become a widow I'm left to raise my three children alone the third not
yet two months old was born in Yerevan Igor and I had thought that if it was 
a girl we would call her Raisa after my motherinlaw and if it was a boy 
we'd call him Arsen after Igor's grandfather I had a girl and I without
Igor named her Raisa in honor of her dead grandmother

Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since  Igor and I grew 
up together we were friends from childhood on We got engaged when I was  
In  when I was  we were married Two children were born to us in 
Sumgait My daughter is now  years old her name is Kristina and my son
Seryozha is four and a half

First I shall tell what happened on February  That day on my way home from 
work I passed Lenin Square where about  people had gathered There were 
Komsomol members there and Pioneers Children's organization and there were 
both Party members and nonParty people there as well All of them were 
shouting There's no room for Christians here and When we finish with the 
Armenians we'll go after the Russians And some even cried Out Death to 
the Armenians Absurd rumors had been circulating about town I became 
frightened I came home breathless and told about everything I had seen 
downtown My family couldn't believe it My fatherinlaw Sogomon Markovich 
Melkumian wasn't home he was at an Azerbaijani wedding By eight o'clock he 
returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was 
smashed with a rock He got out of the car but there was no one there Well I 
was telling him everything too and he said What is there no longer any
government That same day Igor said Papa something terrible is happening 
in the city And he said We'll stay at home no one will drive us from our 
own home

The day passed On February  that was Sunday we didn't go out We called 
our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions and they all said the 
same thing Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an 
Armenian from the neighboring building Ira my brotherinlaw's wife and I 
called the police they're wrecking a car help We called and called and 
nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything

On February  on Monday even though there were troops in the city we were 
afraid to go to work I called the school I had the keys to the classroom I 
told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys I wouldn't 
be coming in He agreed and even said Fine don't come in we understand 
what's going on in town don't come in

Before that on the th the Ambartsumian family came over They came to my 
fatherinlaw and said Uncle Sergey they broke our windows bad things are 
happening in town Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said With my own eyes I 
saw them chasing naked girls through the streets I don't know he said we 
should leave town Well on the th we were already trying to decide where we 
should go thinking we'd go to our dacha We got a couple of bags together 
clothes food the bare essentials And then somewhere around  the 
building manager came by and said Uncle Sergey the situation in town is 
bad don't go out My father even opened up to him and said Maybe we'll 
drive to the dacha it'll be safer there No he said it'll be worse 
there you'll be safer at home He said don't be afraid if something happens 
I'll send people to save you

After he left about  minutes passed and about  people burst into our 
courtyard All of us were at home at the time Igor and I and our two 
children Ira and Edik and their daughter my sisterinlaw Ira and my 
motherand fatherinlaw And the Ambartsumian family there were three of 
them Uncle Misha Zhasmen and their daughter Marina Now when they started
breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us Go in that room
and close the door Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear
that there's anyone home The children started crying Suddenly Ira my 
brotherinlaw's wife suggested Let's run out onto the balcony We  the
two daughtersinlaw and the children and Zhasmen and Marina  raced out
onto the balcony My sisterinlaw and my motherinlaw ran in and said 
Quick over to the other balcony or they'll kill you all We lived on the
second floor We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's At
first we couldn't manage it The balcony looked onto the street At that time
people were coming home from work and many just stood there watching I 
pleaded and begged Please call someone have someone come I even started 
shouting I'll throw down the children I'll throw them down you catch them 
and take them somewhere so at least the children will survive Either they 
were afraid or    I don't know what They looked as though they were 
watching a movie Some of them started throwing stones at us I'll say it 
again these weren't the bandits these were people from the other part of the 
building and from our entryway they were just regular people passersby A 
bus even stopped I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing
over to the other balcony Ira my sisterinlaw helped us get the children 
over there I was pregnant about seven months pregnant No it wasn't yet 
seven it was six and a half I climbed over too I think Zhasmen went first 
you know I just don't remember it all that well Zhasmen went first I think 
and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children and they were all screaming and 
crying My Kristina said Mamma don't throw us over the balcony we're 
afraid Lilia was crying and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too Kristina 
didn't even want to climb over She shouted I'm staying with Grandmother
I'm staying with Grandma She loved her grandma more than she loved me And 
my motherinlaw shouted Oh no Kristina's still there she's still there 
save Kristina too Ira helped us climb over with Kristina coming last Ira 
helped us and went back inside

We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door I pounded with my fist 
Sevil open the door open it please She didn't open it No go away go 
anywhere go I'm not opening the door She was our neighbor we were 
friends we never refused her anything ever And apparently she thought we 
were going to break the windows and she opened the door She opened it and 
said Karina Karina go away go anywhere just don't stay here they'll 
kill us too because of you I begged Please at least take the children 
we'll leave we'll go back No she said you have to leave Her sons ran 
in one had a knife Sevil's brother he's around  shouted at us Get out 
of here leave I'll kill you with this knife I became terrified I took the 
children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs I went down 
and heard a loudspeaker It was in the courtyard The Armenians must be 
killed they've taken all the best places all the best apartments One of 
them said Let the Armenian blood flow none of them should survive When I 
heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors No one opened their 
door for me Not on the third floor or the fourth I couldn't see Zhasmen any 
longer Ira came upstairs later I even thought that they had let her stay 
that they would save her

My head was spinning They were killing my family and here I was in the next 
entryway with two children Seryozha was four and Kristina was five and a 
half They were crying Mamma we're scared They were so frightened that I 
didn't even know how to calm them should I try to calm them or myself It was 
awful But on the third floor a man did open his door I asked Open up let 
me inside He opened the door slightly and said No No and that was it 
He said it so sternly No I went up to the fifth floor I pounded my fists 
on the door with all my might He opened up the man of the house and stood 
there looking at me I was ready to get down on my knees I almost did get 
down on my knees Please I beg of you at least take the children He 
wasn't an Azerbaijani he was a Lezgin I don't even know how but he let me 
inside And when I went in Zhasmen was already there Two minutes hadn't 
passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs Lilia was crying He didn't want 
to open the door And again I started pleading Please open the door it's 
our Ira and Lilia Open the door And he said No I'm afraid I said again 
and again Please open the door please He looked at me He looked at me 
for a long time and then opened the door after all Ira came in with Lilia We 
threw ourselves into each other's arms crying Then the man locked us into 
the bathroom We sat there for a long time Through the door he told us Calm 
the children and calm yourselves down too

Calm down This man was hiding us but what of our family When I was still in 
our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive I 
said Igor Edik let's say farewell And Edik turned around and looked at 
me as if to say is that some kind of joke All the same I thought they would 
kill all of us Igor looked at me too    But it was already too late They 
started pounding on the door Igor was standing next to the door Before that 
he had told us Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight He thought we 
were in the room But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them 
Edik Igor let's say farewell Igor didn't think we could climb over to the 
other balcony And we did get over there and I myself can't believe we were 
able to save ourselves

Igor put on a helmet and Edik had his coat on and he put on a fur hat All 
the menIgor Edik their father and Misha Ambartsumianthey all stood next 
to the door They thought they would pound on it a while and leave But from 
the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani Open the door We 
were all silent waiting Someone outside the door said They're home
they're in there break down the door And I remember my fatherinlaw 
whispering They're going to break it down now it's coming down now    

He had something in his hands I think it was a knife if they got in we were 
going to defend ourselves In the hall near the door there were two metal 
chair legs From outside the door they said We're counting to five open 
up But we were all quiet we didn't answer them We made like no one was 
home We figured they'd leave they'd get tired and leave My fatherinlaw 
had said It's not possible they'd come into my home How can that be 
Everyone knows us all of Sumgait knows our family we are on good terms with 
everyone And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani 
guest at our table We had a nice dacha everyone would get together there 
often Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too But now we had to save 
ourselves we had to flee from our own home Ira I remember said I'm not 
leaving here my brothers and my parents are here I'm going to fight 
alongside them That's just what she said She picked up a knife and said 
If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight 
alongside my family I'm not going anywhere

We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment We heard fighting and 
shouting The noise was terrible And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor 
at the Lezgin's apartment you could hear everything up there too Even Ira's 
voice I remember her calling her mother several times She called her for a 
long time    I started pounding on the door in the bathroom Open the 
door what are they doing to Ira who's shouting that's Ira shouting that's 
her voice But the Lezgin said It's nothing calm down no it's not in 
your apartment He was lying to me so I'd calm down Two hours went by and 
the Lezgin opened the door and said Karina Igor got away calm down He ran 
away He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes They killed him 
outside next to the building

While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror The 
way Ira shouted She shouted Save me Mamma save me    Mamma Mamma 
She repeated it several times There was a wild din There were very many 
people there all of them shouting all of them bellowing howling 
whistlingyou just can't imagine what was going on what the roar was like

Apparently after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway 
where we were hiding and came upstairs all the way up to the fifth floor I 
don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in
particular but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed 
over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughtersinlaw 
were climbing over the balconies And after we heard Ira we heard them coming 
up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors I thought those were 
our last moments and started saying goodbye to my children kissing them 
They were sleeping I woke them up Kristina Seryozha wake up And I tell 
Ira Ira if something happens we'll throw ourselves off the balcony We 
were on the fifth floor Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door 
too because later he said I opened the door and told them there were no 
Armenians inside And after they all left our neighbor went out on the 
balcony himself to see they were gone

We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors we only knew each other from 
the building But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider 
hiding us

The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom They had a candle burning He said 
Karina there're no lights on in our block The whole block was dark the 
whole block It's a huge block too The Lezgin said I'm afraid to keep
you until morning I'm afraid of the neighbors they might kill me for saving
you I said What are you saying we'll leave now But we can't just leave
with the children in the middle of the night Give us time to find somewhere
else to hide He said Well OK go look I asked Ira Ira do you want to
go Ira said No I'll stay with the children Karina I said Fine then
I'll go Zhasmen and I went downstairs together It was very dark No one 
was in the courtyard It was dark pitch black l was afraid to go out at 
after seven Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home I never 
went out alone And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a
slaughter like that too It was probably after eleven Later I called the 
boarding school and my director answered He said Karina where are you I
didn't know I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I 
was I got confused and hung up the receiver From him I only found out what 
time it was I asked him What time is it He said  I think but I 
don't really remember So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard I 
look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment And there
was the smell of something burnt I became horrified I looked at the corpse 
for a long time It was either Ira or Edik I only saw one of them Zhasmen 
grabbed my hand and squeezed it Hurry up let's go    Hurry up come on 
what are you turning around for I turned around and saw a large truck it 
must have belonged to the bandits because they came to kill us in a truck 
like that We lived in the third entryway and that truck was next to the 
fourth We walked quickly holding hands I thought if I go to the police 
then they'll put me away I couldn't count on them Before I reached the 
police station I saw a military vehicle We went over and I said Soldier in 
Block  I don't know if they've killed people or injured themwe need to 
save them And he said Go to the police station and tell them everything 
I said I'm afraid to go there I'm afraid of them He said Don't be 
afraid

We went to the police and they wrote down the address and the military 
vehicle went to our building I didn't go with them they left me at the 
police station I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that 
they'd rescue them too I didn't know where they were or what had happened to
them

After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia First they took us 
to the KGB that was at two or three in the morning Then around five they 
took us to the City Party Committee and there were very many people there 
very many I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress Seryozha was 
only wearing a shirt and Kristina had a little dress on No coat no boots 
nothing And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee

The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped And I thought that he was probably 
alive But then after two and a half days they took us the Armenians of 
Sumgait to Nasosny On March  some people from the Central Committee came 
and told us Karina Ira we need you come with us to the City Party 
Committee My Mamma had come to Nasosny and she had been looking for me for 
six days Mama my brothers and my uncle We went to the City Party Committee 
and waited there in the courtyard I was wearing nothing but a dress and Ira 
had only a dress on as well There was a strong wind on March  An hour went 
by And then one of the functionaries told us Karina Ira gather your 
courage Would you like to go to the burial I said What did they really 
kill all of them He said Let's look He had a long list and he started 
reading them off Igor Melkumian my husband Eduard Melkumian my brotherin
law Irina Melkumian my sisterinlaw Sogomon Melkumian my fatherinlaw
and Raisa Melkumian my motherinlaw He read off all their names and said 
Get in the car let's go to the burial

We buried our family I couldn't believe it at the time I couldn't conceive
of it or imagine it    And even now I think how shall I explain it to my 
children when they're older

My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and
grandmother Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and
grandmother they spoiled her Kristina would always announce My grandma is 
better than anyone Now even though she is getting used to my mother it's 
difficult for her and once she told her You're a bad grandmother

I don't know why I asked her Kristina where's Papa and she said They 
killed him She knows she understands it all And recently I scolded
Seryozha severely for something and he started shouting at me When Papa 
comes I'm going to tell him everything

  I've read most of the history books dealing with this period
  good and bad and while it is possible that I missed one or two
  none of those I've read documents any razing of mosques So I
  think that this remarkable claim requires specific documentation
 
 For the forgetful newcomers here are the references
 
 The reference I based my posting on originally is the book The West
 Bank Story by Rafik Halabi New York Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
   Original title Die Westbank Story 
 
 Quoting from The West Bank Story pages 
 On the night of June  an Israeli officer marched from door to door
 through the Moghrabi Quarter of East Jerusalem giving the residents
 three hours' notice to evacuate their homes 
 
  The participants in a
 July   meeting of a group of Arab relgious and political
 figures protested the immodest dress of Israelis visiting the mosques
 and the destruction of two mosques in the Moghrabi Quarter adjacent to
 the Western Wall
 
 This issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of
 just one reference probably won't resolve this issue to those that
 oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed Even in your
 location of this one reference you spend most of your quote dealing
 with an incidence that while abhorrant has nothing to do with the 
 issue at hand here Then at the end of the quote there is an almost
 offhand comment that two mosques were destroyed

  Tim you're missing the big sleightofhand here  I can accept every
  word quoted from Halabi and still have ZERO evidence of any mosques
  being razed  Note that what Halabi refers to is not that mosques
  were razed but that people PROTESTED alleged razing  Too well we
  know that this is a common demagogic tactic or has anyone forgotten
  the Temple Mount riots when the Moslem crowd was led to believe
  that the Israeli Guards were there to cover for the TMF instead of
  stop them

I appeal to to all of you to show up in Washington DC this saturday to
participate in a peaceful demonstration for the sake of humanity This is a 
critical point in the history of world and we can make a change otherwise things
will not change there in Bosnia Rapeskillingsethnic cleansing will
go on as a norm in the days to follow The UN will get to the towns after the fall
of thousands of inocent civilians like in Zapa just the past weekend It happened
to the Jews in 's it's happening to the muslims today and who will be the next
victim

Since the Europeans want to remain indifferent in this issue time has come for US to
take a leadership role to stop these crimes against humanity Time is now and
this is for real folks the people of New England Bosnian Relief Committee seriously believe
that Clinton's Adminstration will stop supporting the Bosnian cause without sustained
public pressure I just called Democaratic Sen John Kerry's office and they are saying that 
he the senator is waiting for president to take a decision means that he will wait and 
join the bandwagon later if it ever moves 

Please don't rely on others to take part in this demonstration You as an individual
will make a big difference Bring your families too not only you will help a great
cause but also it will be fun for all I know of several families from Massachusetts
who are travelling friday night to participate there Contact the local Islamic center
or Bosnia relief agency if you want to travel by prearranged busses The best option 
for students is to rentacar and carpool Please spread the word around

I think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which
one can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute
racial discrimination These criteria are to be found for example in the
  International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial
    Discrimination ratified by most countries
   The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights
   The Human Rights Charter
   The European Convention of Human Rights

If one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these
legally binding instruments and does not resort to sophistry it is
obvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination


The people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion
by the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees some of whom live
under Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora

They are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole
reason that they are not Jews International law does not include any
provisions which permits such denial of rights under any circumstance
Israel's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral By allowing
the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of
the State of Israel the State would finally gain its legitimaty under
international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized It
would facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middleeast
and constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence 
in the area Any attempt to create a separation formal and human between the
Israeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab communities is fraught with
genociadal implications I hope that US Jews who sincerely wish that
peace prevail in IsraelPalestine will finally realize this fact

Elias Davidsson

Zionist racial discrimination are described

Subject Labour's enclaves policyIMPORTANT


Labour's enclaves policy in the occupied territories

by Israel Shahak
publ in Middle East International London 

It is not difficult to discover Israel's policy towards the 
Palestinians at any given time It can be easily inferred 
from the facts on the ground and from the information 
provided by the Hebrew press There is one condition 
though The torrents of claptrap about the peace 
process must be totally ignored as must Israel's official 
pronouncements whole sole purpose is to distort reality 
By concentrating only on the facts it was early apparent 
that Labour's policies were no different from those of 
Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their 
more effective implementation

Likud's policies were accurately described by Ariel 
Sharon in an article accompanied by a map in Yediot 
Aharonot last August The Sharon plan envisaged a 
division of the West Bank into seven and the Gaza Strip 
into four autonomous Palestinian enclaves all of them 
under Israeli supervision The total area of these 
enclaves amounted to about  per cent of the 
territories The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli 
settlements and the highways built around the enclaves 
The entire area around Jerusalem from the outskirts of 
Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem has already 
been turned into a Greater Jerusalem where the Arab
inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded 
by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for 
them

Judging from Labour's settlement policy it may be 
assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number 
of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had 
planned But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by 
settlements strategically dispersed along the highways 
remains unchanged Labour plans only four enclaves in 
the West Bank two in Samaria and two in Judea ie 
north and south of Jerusalem respectively and no more 
than two in the Gaza Strip In regard to Greater 
Jerusalem Labour's policies hardly deviate from 
Sharon's

A saner version of Likud policy

As some Israeli correspondents at once realised Labour 
policies were but a saner version of Sharon's 
extravaganza Last July Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot that while barely a few months ago Labour 
supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond 
the Green Line no specific decision to freeze 
construction in the territories has been taken And Uzi 
Benziman wrote in Ha'aretz that as far as can be judged 
on the basis of the internal political discussions in 
Jerusalem Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways

The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are 
located in Samaria Therefore the belt of settlements 
around the TransSamaria Highway designed to 
separate those enclaves from each other is of paramount 
importance According to the latest data the percentage 
of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population 
apart from East Jerusalem is a mere  per cent But 
for the area around the TransSamaria Highway the 
corresponding figure is almost  per cent and it is 
increasing steadily The situation in the settlements of 
the Efrat Block south of Jerusalem designed to sever 
the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around 
Hebron is pretty much the same The Efrat Block is now 
being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway

The project is costly in the extreme because the highway 
is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long 
tunnels The final decision to build this highway was 
suspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in 
March The subsequent decision to renew its construction 
can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a 
whole

Process of impoverishment

The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady 
impoverishment of the Palestinians This is well known 
in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be 
concerned including the PLO In regard to the Gaza Strip 
the whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in 
Ha'aretz in March He mentions having seen a pamphlet 
issued six years ago by the Civil Administration 
forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli 
rule in  His analysis deserves to be quoted 
extensively

We continue to steal the Strip's water even though its 
quality deteriorates from year to year We continue to 
steal the Strip's tiny land resources in order to found 
there more and more settlements as if we deliberately 
want to make the inhabitants despair and in their 
despair think in termws of having nothing to lose It is 
by our own doing that the Strip's workers must now 
spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time 
as they spend working From the military point of view 
we have kept control of no more than half the Strip's 
area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and 
resources About a year before Moshe Arens left the 
defence ministry I heard him saying that we should 
withdraw from the Strip come what may His argument 
was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and 
deeper He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak 
Shamir but he rejected it Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too

Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can 
also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being 
implemented The Qatif Block settlements founded by 
the first Rabin government of  are intended to 
divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves Efraim 
Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli 
this enterprise is The Qatif Block is now producing  
per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export and a 
substantial proportion of cut flowers He also deals with 
the subsidies the settlers receive considerably 
augmented by the present government Owing to them 
housing units are cheap The present government does 
not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block 
Any prospective settler will get a  per cent mortgage 
for his house on top of a grant of  shekels 


Such data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the 
Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to 
work in Israel The economic motivations were explained 
by Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March

From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be 
sealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could 
be barred from entering IsraelEven though accurate 
data is hard to come by it is indisputable that during the 
last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving 
daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased from 
 in the mid's to  today But the decrease 
is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel 
from Gaza It is also due to the drastic curtailment of 
demand for Gazan labour in Israel With unemployment 
in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments 
blocks virtually halted the workers from Gaza are no 
longer really needed

Gaza's total dependence

The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent 
on Israel In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has 
been an increase in subcontracted work for Israeli 
factories mostly footware and textiles Thousands of 
small workshops employing an average of four workers 
get their raw materials or unfinished products together 
with detailed working instructions from Israeli factories 
Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that 
the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely  per cent 
of that in the West Bank which in turn stands at half the 
average wage in Israel and besides the Gazan employer 
does not pay any social security for his employees If 
the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that 
in Israel the profits of Israeli factories and even of 
Palestinian subcontractors must be vast

They are higher still when a Gazan subcontractor 
provides labour to be performed at home with the 
family's help The livelihood of tens of thousands of 
Gazans depends on such subcontracted work Many of 
them are women and children paid about ten shekels 
 a day which can last  hours or more There can 
be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan 
labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition 
of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from 
the Strip

Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from 
what was created straight after Israel's conquest in 
 In this respect one should not be deluded by the 
talk nowadays fashionable about Israeli gestures 
intended to encourage economic development in the 
territories As Israeli journalists point out all permits 
for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval 
by the Shin Bet Behind all the professed goodwill there 
is no desire to solve problems just the attitude of a good 
colonialist willing to do something for the benefit of the 
natives but on condition that they behave nicely do not 
become rebellious and never do anything against the 
interests of the metropolis its economic interests 
included wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February The 
development of subcontracted work in the Gaza Strip 
accords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis

Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work 
In all branches of the economy lobbies have been set in 
motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from 
the threat of any Palestinian competition The method is 
simplicity itself As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds 
in persuading the government or even the trade and 
industry minister alone a military order is issued 
prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel If this 
does not suffice a Palestinian factory may be denied a 
licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse 
its production Among the most active of such lobbies is 
the agricultural one It has succeeded in limiting exports 
of Gazan vegetables except for those grown by settlers 
not only to Israel but also to Europe where they 
otherwise might compete with Israeli exports

Perpetuaring apartheid

Labour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in 
the territories The same goal is shared by the US which 
otherwise could not support the Labour government so 
firmly In my view one of the reasons the US feels 
happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its 
greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive This 
point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv who 
deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to 
Likud's inefficiency he showed that the peak yearly 
settlement growth occured during the term of office of 
the National Unity government ie  in which 
Rabin served throughout as the defence minister 
Likud's reputation for settling the territories better than 
Labour is false attributable to the many tiny settlements 
without strategic value founded under Shamir for 
symbolic reasons

To sum up Labour's policy unconditionally supported by 
the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the 
efficiency with which it is implemented According to 
that policy the territories are to be divided into two 
parts The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly 
and the minor part indirectly In my view this racist 
scheme is doomed to ultimately fail but at a horrifying 
price in human suffering The sooner its true nature is 
recognised the less suffering it may cause

Ethiopian Jews and notquite Jews

The Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian 
Jews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to 
Israel who are dying of starvation The following are 
excerpts from an interview with the former general 
director of the JDC project for development and welfare 
of Ethiopian Jews Kobi Friedman Hadashot  April 
 who has stated that there are people dying in 
Addis Ababa but they are converts to Christianity

Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after 
viewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa 
How do you know that they are actually converts to 
Chritianity 

If there are Jews on the tape then I don't know what to 
say I am speaking from experience when I say that those 
who remained in Ethiopia are Christians I know that 
there have previously been things published in the press 
by interesting parties and there is no connection 
between them and reality

What interested parties 

Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives 
to come here

What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel 
do when their parents and the rest of their relatives 
remain in Ethiopia 

I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the 
 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia Well my answer is 
that it is not It would be a better solution economically 
as well for that young man to buy a oneway ticket to 
Ethiopia and reunite with his family there

 In the NY Times on Sunday May  in an article on Somalia a
 reporter writes
 
     But last year Iran quietly took over four islands belonging
   to the United Arab Emirates and deported their people with hardly a
   protest from the United States 
 
 Does anyone know what this is referring to  I seem to have missed it
 Spiked no doubt 

 There was something in the NYT and other sources about this for a few
 days  It is an ongoing border disupute and when the Iranians kicked
 out the UAE people it was briefly reported this was many moons ago
 I don't recall reading of any public US comment if it were a strong
 protest I probably would have seen it

Those islands would be Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs I presume
I don't know about a fourth The latter two islands belong to Iran and so

According to the NY Times the  islands belong to the United Arab
Emirates 

could not be taken over The major row is over Abu Musa which has been 
jointly administered by Iran and UAE The dispute goes back to the early
's when Britain evacuated the island and Iran under the Shah reclaimed
the island which had historical ties to Iran No British objection was
raised at that time

It is my understanding that UAE residents of Abu Musa are currently free to
travel to and from the island and that Iran is desiring diplomatic resolution 
of the dispute 

Why is it then that when the British Iranians and UAE refer to
Occupied Territory they mean territory in dispute in Israel but not
in their own affairs

Allegations of Jewish
disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are
one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture and
rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms
than blood libel 

About  years ago there was a lot of noise about a Church in the Old
City of Jerusalem being taken over by a Jewish group  In fact the
building in question was a dormitory that belonged to a church and was 
not physically connected to any church  It had been leased to a
Palestinean Arab for  years and a Jewish group subleased it from
him  The church that owned the building disapproved and legal action
was started to revoke the sublease  The media however made it look
like Jewish vigilantes were stealing Church property in Jerusalem by
force 

The stereotypes that pervade our culture create
cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes Therefore any
claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by
decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented

The damage has already been done by the press in the above case  It
is not surprising by now of course that many decent people regard
the press with utmost suspicion

If such a claim is crossposted to a news group in which it has
not been documented before such as scj a reference should be
given the first time it appears  Now that the claim has been
documented I regard the whole episode as disgusting and
shameful Especially so because the official who failed to
provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians
was probably Jewish and as a Jew I know that he should have
known better

You appear to be referring to Moshe Dayan  How do you know that the
evicted Jordanians were not provided with something else  In fact
this thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did
not own but received compensation for their loss anyways  Woe to
Jews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them
by force with ethnic cleansing of any remaining Jews is
disgusting and shameful

FIGURE IN ADL SPY CASE ARRESTED AT SF AIRPORT

    ESPIONAGE Former police officer is taken into custody upon
    arriving from Philippines where he had fled after FBI
    interrogation

By Jenifer Warren Times staff writer

San Francisco  A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the
Philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law
enforcement information to an investigator for the AntiDefamation
League was arrested at the airport here on  felony charges police
said Friday

Thomas J Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after
the FBI questioned him about his activities was apprehended Thursday
night after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard
was returning home

Gerard  was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday
morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count
each of computer theft burglary and conspiracy

If convicted on all charges Gerard could face  years in prison and
 in fines  Bail was initially set at  after police
argued that he was a flight risk but it was later reduced to  
A friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon a
sheriff's spokeswoman said

Gerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child
with whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito and wanted to have
his day in court said Police Capt John Willett his former boss and
one of two arresting officers

Gerard an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from
 to  also feared that the CIA was out to kill him Willett
said  In an interview with The Times last month Gerard threatened to
disclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he
was indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges

Gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network
operated by the AntiDefamation League a prominent Jewish civil
rights organization  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave
criminal histories to Roy Bullock a San Francisco art dealer who said
he has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for  years

Investigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's
home computer  which contained entries on  people and 
groups  and in boxes in his apartment  Files have also been seized
under search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los
Angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents

Gerard could not be reached for comment Friday and his attorney
James Lassart did not return telephone calls seeking comment  In the
interview with The Times last month however Gerard acknowledged
snooping and sharing some information with Bullock but denied any
criminal wrongdoing

Bullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling
intelligence to South Africa

ADL officials have described Bullock as a aweek independent
contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal
activity  On Friday ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest
has nothing to do with ADL  Other than that we have no comment on
the case

ArabAmerican groups  which were a main target of the spying
according to police  applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to
pursue the investigation

We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly
disclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement said
James Zogby head of the Arab American Institute in Washington

Police meanwhile characterized Gerard's arrest  the first in the
inquiry into the spying scandal  as an unexpected breakthrough  A
former police colleague of Gerard Inspector Fred Mollat visited
Gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home

I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever but
we didn't think it would happen this quickly Capt Willett said 
This development really speeds up our timetable on the case

During his year career on the police force Gerard was a highly
regarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence
division  His last assignment was on the gang task force

After FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall he took early retirement
and fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan  miles south of
Manila

Gerard was arrested at  pm as he stepped from his Philippines
Airlines flight He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard
after his sixmonth hiatus police said

He was surprised when he saw us standing there and got a shocked
look on his face Willett said  Then he said 'Hello I'm back'

Yedi'ot Ahronot April    Excerpt

EACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO

 A reference to General Azri'el Nevo Shamir's Military Secretary 
Irrelevant to this excerpt

By Nahum Barne'a

  

In mid ' SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm  
A year and a half earlier Khaled Sheikh Ali  a member of the
Islamic Jihad died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison  The
two SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put
on trial In September ' the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and
sentenced them to  months in prison  As far as is known this was
the first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to
prison  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the
director of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the
effectiveness of other interrogators  The judges in the case
were  Barak Goldberg and Matza

When they realized that they were on their own the interrogators
agreed to talk  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkarsp was placed
in charge of investigating the affair  She  questioned the
directors of all SHABAK divisions  She investigated only the matter
of the death in Gaza prison  She discovered that not only torture
but also the culture of lies which Judge Landau had described in
his report of two years before were still very much in existence 
Nothing had changed

The report was classified and was seen by only some ten people among
them the Prime Minister the people at the top of the judicial system
and Judge Landau  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not
know  After all they were dealing only with a single jail and with
low ranking people  The system bit the bullet and accepted the
explanation  One of SHABAK's highranking officials was transfered
from his very high position to a less high position

  

The culture of lies referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators'
policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were
tortured in the course of interrogation  The Landau commission sought
to correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods 
thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those
methods were used to extract a confession  The fact that the need to
lie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking
to the approved torture methods  Yigal

I'm not sure about this but I hope the answer is that you can't apply under
the law of return  By conversion you've elected not to be a part of the
Jewish nation

Which was my point By converting to another religion I do not loose
my cultural identity I just loose my religious identification

	I disagree  By converting to another religion you certainly
do change your cultural identity and lose that part of you which was
Jewish


At the moment you converted you officially anounced to the world
that you do not consider yourself to be part of the Jewish Nation
So why should the Jewish Nation consider you to be a member

To be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not
by my religion Actually if I am an atheist which is in fact like 
converting into a nonJewish in terms of religion I am still considered as
part of the Jewish Nation

	No there is a serious cultural and religios difference
between renouncing the jewish god and accepting a new one  Thou
shall have no other gods before me  Conversion is a violation of
this atheism you might be able to wiggle around with

 There are Arabs in cabinet but look how long it took and to what
 insignificant positions they are assigned And this is based solely
 on race not political belief or security as Jewish members of the
 same party have always been welcome just not their fellow Arabs

First of all the arab standing in any party or as any party is solely
dependent upon the amount of political power they can wield effectively

It is not a question of an individuals standing When a party puts up an
Arab for a Cabinet post and that Arab is rejected but the position is given
to a Jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism
Would you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with Labour
coalitions

In the past they have not been effective at garnering votes and forming
a single bloc in the knesset  On the few occasions when this was done
some of the parties took stands that were extremist and ineffect precluded
themselves from forming a coalition and participating in the cabinet

Not their party  them as individuals Even when they belong to nice
peaceful Zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome Arabs are
excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse It
sure looks like racism to me

Arabs are excluded from cabinet even when they do the things you
suggest because they are Arabs Unless of course you have a better
reason I am happy to listen to any good reason why a leftist Jew
is less of a security risk than a leftist Arab from the same party
Look at the present cabinet

genocide of  million Muslim people by the Armenians between
 and  not a crookidiot like yourself


Source World Alive A Personal Story by Robert Dunn Crown Publishers 
Inc New York  
Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of  
 million Muslim people

p  seventh paragraph and p  first paragraph

 'The most are inside houses Come you and look'
 'No dammit My stomach isn't'
 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform Him you must see'
 We were under those trees by the mosque in an open space
 'I don't believe you I said but followed to a nailstudded door The 
  man pushed it ajar then spurred away leaving me to check on the corpse 
  I thought I should this charge was so constant so gritted my teeth and 
  went inside

 The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes and was dark at first for 
 its stone walls had only window slits Rags strewed the mud floor around an 
 iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black 
 with soot All looked bare and empty but in an inner room flies buzzed As 
 the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face 
 up naked but for its grimy turban He was about fifty years old by what 
 was left of his face  a rifle butt had bashed an eye The one left slanted 
 as with Tartars rather than with Turks Any uniform once on him was gone so 
 I'd no proof which he was and quickly went out gagging at the mess of his  
 slashed genitals

p  first paragraph 

 'How many people lived there'
 'Oh about eight hundred' He yawned
 'Did you see any Turk officers'
 'No sir I was in at dawn All were Tartar civilians in mufti'

 The lieutenant dozed off then I but in the small hours a voice woke me  
 Dro's He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer Anyone keelhauled
 so long and furiously I'd never heard Then abruptly Dro broke into 
 laughter quick and simple as child's Both were a cover for his sense
 of guilt I thought or hoped For somehow despite my boast of irreligion
 Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
 have been

 From daybreak on Armenian villagers poured in from miles around
 The women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over
 the carcass of Djul They hauled out every hovel's chattels the last 
 scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags 
 looms even spinningwheels

 'Thank you for a lot Dro' I said to him back in camp 'But now I must 
 leave'We shook hands the captain said 'A bientot mon camarade' And 
 for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains 
 Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in 
 a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran'

p 

At morning tea Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
 high region called the Karabakh Deep in tactics they spoke Russian
 but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
 of promises made by tribal chiefs A campaign shaped more raids on
 Moslem villages

p 

It will be three hours to take Dro told me We'd close in on three
 sides
The men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets Merrimanov
said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow
That is for morale Dro put in We must keep the Moslems in terror
Soldiers or civilians I asked
There is no difference said Dro All are armed in uniform or not
But the women and children
Will fly with the others as best they may

p 

The ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still Hundreds of feet 
 down the fog held solid as cotton flock 'Djul lies under that' said 
 Dro pointing 'Our men also attack from the other sides'

 Then 'Wheeee'  his whistle lined up all at the rock edge Bayonets
 clicked upon carbines Over plunged Archo his black haunches rippling
 then followed the staff the horde  nose to tail bellies taking the
 spur Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though 
 I heard our Utica brass roar

 As I watched from the height it took ages for Djul to show clear A tsing
 of machinegun fire took over from the thumping batteries cattle lowed
 dogs barked invisible while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
 puddle Mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly
 The came a shrill wailing

 Now among the cloudstreaks rose darker wisps  smoke Red glimmered about
 house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs A mosque stood in
 clump of trees thick and green Through crooked alleys on fire horsemen
 were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot

 'Tartarski' shouted the gunner by me Others pantomimed them in escape
 over the rocks while one twisted a bronze shellnose loaded and yanked
 breechcord firing again and again Shots wasted I thought when by
 afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body But these shots and
 the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries

 At length all shooting petered out I got on my horse and rode down toward
 Djul It burned still but little flame showed now The way was steep and 
 tough through dense scrub Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly
 through alders on smoldering houses Across trampled wheat my brothersin
 arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb

p  fourth paragraph

Corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair 
 large eyes She looked about twelve years old She lay in some stubble 
 where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting The bayonet 
 had gone through her back I judged for blood around was scant Between 
 the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun 
 dress

 The next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and kneepants He 
 lay face down in the path by several huts One arm reached out to the 
 pewter bowl he'd carried now upset upon its dough Steel had jabbed 
 just below his neck into the spine 

 There were grownups too I saw as I led the sorrel around Djul was 
 empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's Germanspeaking 
 colonel He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead

p 

 more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled

  Turkish troop shifts hidden arms spies  Christian Red or Tartar

  An Armenia without Armenians Turks under Christian rule His lips
  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache That's bloodshed  just

You are right to notice my assumptions I should have used Bosnian 
Serbs and Serbia and Bosnian Muslims in my post

How quaint of you to point this out and then to completely ignore
all of the blatant lies you've trotted out The scenario and genocide 
staged by the Armenians  years ago in Eastern Anatolia and xSoviet
Armenia is being reenacted again  this time in Azerbaijan There are 
remarkable similarities between the plots the perpetrators and the 
underdogs 

Remember in article BACDnewsserviceuciedu you have 
blatantly lied and still have not corrected yourself

The Goltz article was NOT published in the Sunday Times Magazine
on March   but in the Guardian Sunday Section The story WAS 
NOT filed frim Agdam but from London 

I'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits

Source 'The Sunday Times'  March  a British Weekly written by 
        Thomas Goltz from Agdam Azerbaijan

    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES

    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former
Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with coldblooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in warracked NagornoKarabakh
    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more
than   Azeris many of  them women and  children who were  fleeing an
attack  on their  town Hundreds  possibly thousands  were missing  and
feared dead
    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending
the women  and children  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified
refugees The few  survivors later described what  happened That's when
the real  slaughter began said  Azer Hajiev  one of three  soldiers to
survive The  Armenians just shot and  shot And then they  came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives
     They were shooting shooting shooting echoed Rasia Aslanova who
arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through
Armenian lines She said her husband Kayun and a soninlaw were killed
in front of her Her daughter was still missing
    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off

    The survivors  said   others some of  whom had  fled separately
were still missing in the gruelling terrain many could perish from their
wounds or the cold
    By late  yesterday  deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in
Agdam's morgue  and  bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery  Of the
seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial two  were children and  three were
women one shot through the chest at point blank range
    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror  Doctors said they
had  patients who escaped slaughter most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds
    Nor were they safe in Agdam On friday night rockets fell on the city
which  has a  population  of   destroying  several buildings  and
killing one person

Now wait there is more

           IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre

 year old Hatin Nine telling

''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes They told
me We won't kill you But the babies have to die in front of your eyes''

 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu

 ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours
  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said You are
  Turks you must die''

 year old Gulsum Huseyin

 ''They bayonetted my  year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes''

Are these stories lies Have the eyewitnesses been daydreaming
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists too Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article TheyBritish reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists What is more here are the pictures Pictures
of people who were bayonetted whose eyes were gouged ears cut off

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these lies They are saying
exaggeration That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in  hours instead of  Or Gulsum Huseyin's
 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word

Some of the western press' led by some French Newspapers ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed So were the
French TV channels The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCEConference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe and rules all designed to fight against human
rights violations International reactions must be made with international
cooperation With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty Where
is the cooperation Where are the reactions And the intellectuals
journalists writers TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of human rights
Where are you

A few thousand

Yup

Yes there are a few thousand left today after years of opression by 
Turkey

I expect better from you 'Mau' No I take that back I don't The 
treaty on the exchange of the Turkish and Greek minorities  left 
no Greek minority in Turkiye except a few thousand Greeks in istanbul 
Turkiye is no longer an obstacle for 'PanHellenism' Although the material 
basis of Greek policy is no longer visible there is a residue which 
seems to unite the Pelopenisians the Greeks who came from Asia Minor 
the Greeks who are originally from the islands of the Marmara Sea
or those who live in the numerous Aegean islands This residue is 
also recognizable in the contemporary Greek government

As far a Greek Turkish wars are conserned I find it funny that a 
so informed Turk like you forgot to mention the Balkan wars 

Not a chance Greece lost in each and every war conducted solely 
between Greece and Turkiye in the Morea in  in Thessaly in 
 and in Anatolia in  After the Ottoman Empire lost 
World War I the British landed in  a  Greek army in 
Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye Are you suffering 
from a severe case of amnesia The tired and defeated Turks rose up
formed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal and
on August   they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army

 Turkiye 
 is no longer an obstacle for 'PanHellenism' Besides Greece lost 
 in each and every war conducted solely between Greece and Turkiye in 
 the Morea in  in Thessaly in  and in Anatolia in  
 Especially the  Greek defeat referred to as 'the Tragedy of 
 Anatolia' by the Greeks had momentous effects on Greek mind and 
 behaviour

I find it curious that a historian like you forgot the wars that 
demolished the Ottoman Empire   

I love people who don't read and then spout myths as evidence Where
were Greeks in  and  I guess they were busy with

  Greek Efforts to Decimate the Jewish Population of Salonica
             Culminated in  and 

  Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled
  particularly to Salonica whose Jewish population increased substantially
  as a result from  in  to  in  more than half the
  total population though even there increased persecution by local Greeks
  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire particularly to
  the great port of Izmir

  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike the ritual
  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on Greek
  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 
  and  following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War
  when many of its Jews were either killed or terrorized into leaving

  Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow
  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to
  practice their religions without hindrance a law was issued in 
  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday stimulating a new
  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do Between  and  there was a
  series of antiSemitic riots in Salonica with the Cambel quarter where
  most of the remaining Jews lived being burned to the ground This
  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting
  Hebrew and JudeaSpanish in the Jewish schools A start was made also
  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica
  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out  By
  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews the Greeks left a
  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time and starting
  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the
  occupation of Greece starting in 

  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for
  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence
  Istanbul Edirne and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received
  thousands more Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by
  the government of the Sultan Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in
  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained
  independence or expanded The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the
  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century and particularly during
  and after the Crimean War combined with the same independence movements
  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among
  its Jews caused thousands of helpless ill and povertystricken Muslim
  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the
  Ottoman Empire with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly
  to house and feed them as best it could From  to  as many as
   Crimean Tatars Circassians and other Muslims from north and
  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone as many as  more
  came during the next twenty years while  refugees entered in 
   as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states
  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the
  Empire

tried to complete its centuriesold policy of annihilation against

Quotations from Zionist leaders

 There was no such thing as Palestinians
Golda Meir Prime Minister of Israel London Sunday 
Times  June 

They certainly never CALLED themselves Palestinians

 When we have settled the land all the Arabs will be 
able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged 
cockroaches in a bottle
Raphael Eitan Israeli Chief of Staff New York Times  
April 

Coming from a soldier that can't surprise you  Eitan is now in
charge of Tsomet and there's a reason why he only gets a few votes
every year  They only elect him because he is squeaky clean no 
corruption

 The Palestinians are beasts walking on two legs
Menachem Begin Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to 
the Knesset
quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk 'Begin and the Beasts New 
Statesman  June 

I'm ignorant  What's New Statesman

 Both the process of expropriation of the Palestinians 
and the removal of the poor must be carried out 
discreetly and circumspectly
Dr Theodor Herzl The Complete Diaries Herzl Press 
 I p

Oh those Crafty Jews again  When will you learn antiSemite from 
Iceland

 Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no 
room for both people together in this countryThe only 
solution is a Palestinewithout Arabs And there is no 
other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the 
neighboring countries to transfer all of them not one 
village not one tribe should be left
Joseph Weitz Jewish National Fund administrator 
responsible for Zionist colonization Davar  September 


Let's face it in  what other view was there

We shall try to spirit the penniless population the 
Palestinians across the border by procuring employment 
for it in the transit countries while denying it any 
employment in our own country
Theodor Herzl The Complete Diaries Herzl Press  
I p

The penniless could mean anyone big guy  Grow up  I hate
your brackets  

 Zionistslooked for meansto cause the tens of 
thousands of sulky Arabs who remained in the Galilee to 
fleeI gathered all the Jewish muktars who have contact 
with Arabs in different villages and asked them to 
whisper in the ears of some Arabs that a great Jewish 
reinforcement has arrived in Galilee and that it is going 
to burn all of the villages of the Huleh They should 
suggest to these Arabs as their friends to escape while 
there is still timeThe tactic reached its goalwide 
areas were cleaned

Yig'al Alon Sepher Ha Palmach in Hebrew II p 
quoted in Khalidi From Haven to Conquest IPS 

They gave them advance warning  Not like the PLO eh

 Jews must expel Arabs and take their place 
David Ben Gurion  quoted in Shabtai Teveth Ben 
Gurion and the Palestine Arabs Oxford University Press 
 p 

Yeah yeah  More brackets  Am I too picky


 We must do everything to ensure they the 
Palestinian refugees never do return
David Ben Gurion in his diary  July  quoted in 
Michael Bar Zohar Ben Gurion The Armed Prophet 
PrenticeHall  p

Bracket man

 The country was mostly an empty desert with only 
a few islands of Arab settlement
Shimon Peres Minister of Defense quoted in David's 
Sling The Arming of Israel Weidenfeld and Nicholson 
 p

That was the truth  Were you there Elias

 All this story about the danger of extermination of 
Jews has been blown upto justify the annexation of 
new Arab territories
Mordechai Bentov Israeli Cabinet Minister Al 
Hamishmar  April 

So the Holocaust never happened eh Naziman Elias


 Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can 
disqualify terrorism as a means of combat
Yitzhak Shamir Hehazit Summer  Journal of the 
LEHI the Stern Gang translated from the Israeli daily 
AlHamishmar  December 

Lehi always warned in advance  Not the PLO buddy boy

 The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab 
workers is a cancer in our body
A Uzan Israeli Minister of Agriculture Ha'aretz  
December 

It was true  Why should Jews be unemployed  We say that in
America Jerky

 There can be only one national home in Palestine 
and that a Jewish one and no equality in the partnership 
between Jews and Arabs
Montague David Eder President of the Zionist 
Federation of Great Britain 
in Doreen Ingrams comp Palestine Papers  
Seeds of Conflict George Braziller  p 

I firmly believe that today

 I hope that the Jewish frontiers of Palestine will be 
as great as Jewish energy for getting Palestine
Dr Chaim Weizmann first President of the State of 
Israel Excerpts from His Historic Statements Writings 
and Addresses Jewish Agency for Palestine  p

You don't understand metaphor Naziman
And your quotes lead nowhere  Not only do I doubt there actuality
but I guarantee they were compiled by some neoNazi group

But I love your pseudointellectual approach  It makes you
sound even dumber than your conclusions

RTw     GULF ARABS DEMAND IRAN WITHDRAWAL FROM ISLANDS 

 Eds updates with end of summit details quotes 
    By Youssef Azmeh 
    ABU DHABI Dec  Reuter  Gulf Arab states emerging from a summit
that restored 
their unity after almost three months of crisis piled pressure on Iran
on Wednesday to 
reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic Gulf island 
    They issued a statement after a threeday Gulf Cooperation Council
summit saying Iran 
had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding
measures that rocked 
Gulf stability and security 
    The leaders avoided the antiIranian rhetoric of recent statements
by Egypt which 
engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia
and Qatar that 
allowed all members to attend the summit 
    Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and
Tehran's alleged 
encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind
President Hosni 
Mubarak's mediation 
    The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the
Gulf Arab states and 
Iran is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take
in line with its 
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and 
territorial integrity of the region's states 
    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa which it
shares with the 
United Arab Emirates and the continued occupation of the Greater and
Lesser Tumbs 
islands 
    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a
small garrison it 
established there in  under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah 
    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the 
UAE government But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority
over the whole 
island which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation 
    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in  and the
UAE has since the 
Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part
of a general 
settlement 
    The GCC leaders called on the UN to maintain sanctions against
Iraq for not fully 
implementing Security Council resolutions following its  invasion of
Kuwait 
    They endorsed once again the Damascus Declaration a pact signed
with Egypt and 
Syria after their troops took part in the US led alliance that drove
Iraqi troops out of 
Kuwait 
    But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a
fund they 
announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year
which would have 
helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme 
    They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of
contributions from each state 
although the total amount had been scaled down to  billion from the
 billion agreed 
last year 
    The fact that the leaders of all GCC states  Saudi Arabia
Bahrain Kuwait Oman and 
Qatar  attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although
their unity was only 
maintained with outside help 
    Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow
progress of the 
conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the
region that boasts 
the bulk of global oil and gas reserves 
    The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals 
    One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos
to create a 
man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member
against external 
aggression such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
    Another was a Saudisupported plan to expand the existing man
Peninsula 
Shield force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is
commanded by a Saudi 
general 
    Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market
although the summit 
called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due
to be held in 
Saudi Arabia next December 
 REUTER YA DYA DJG 



RTw     GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT 

    ABU DHABI Dec  Reuter  Gulf Arab states ended a threeday
annual summit on 
Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three
strategic Gulf islands as 
a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf 
    A joint statement issued after the summit marked by relief over the
settlement of a 
row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members also called for
continued UN sanctions 
against Iraq 
    It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council
decisions following the 
expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year 
    The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common
market but called on 
officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six
members to the next 
summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December  
    The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf
Arab states and Iran 
is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in
line with its 
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and 
territorial integrity of the region's states 
    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa which it
shares with the 
United Arab Emirates and the continued occupation of the smaller
islands the Greater and 
Lesser Tumbs 
    It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified
Iranian measures 
which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on
Iran to rescind 
those measures and end the occupation which it said was shaking peace
and stability in 
the area 
    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a
small garrison it 
established there in  under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah 
    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the 
UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces
continue to 
exercise their authority over the whole island 
    The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation 
    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in  and the
UAE has since the 
Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part
of a general 
settlement

RTw     IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS 

 Eds updates with SNSC statement 
    NICOSIA Dec  Reuter  Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on
Saturday it was ready 
to defend militarily three disputed islands reminding them of its
eightyear war with 
Iraq 
    Our eightyear defence in the  IranIraq war has proved to
the world that 
our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and
safeguard the 
territorial integrity of Iran Iran's Supreme National Security Council
SNSC said 
    A meeting of the heads of the sixnation Gulf Cooperation Council
voiced full support 
on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates UAE in its dispute with Iran
over the Gulf 
islands of Abu Musa Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb 
    The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings
Besides the UAE the GCC 
also groups Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar and Saudi Arabia 
    Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani who chaired the SNSC's
meeting on 
Saturday said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University
Iran is surely 
stronger than the likes of you To reach these islands one has to cross
a sea of blood 
    The SNSC quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received
in Cyprus also 
criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as irresponsible 
   No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil
said the SNSC 
    Earlier on Saturday the English language Tehran Times believed to
be close to the 
Foreign Ministry said the UAE should be aware that Iran's
selfrestraint had certain 
limits 
    It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 
agreement to 
share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied 
    The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain
from responding to 
the blows inflicted by them was childish Tehran Times said 
    IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which
urged Iran to 
reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull
out of the two other 
islands 
    Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have
historically belonged to it 
The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa 
 REUTER AF JCH 

RTw     TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN 

    TEHRAN Dec  Reuter  Radical Iranian newspapers angered by Gulf
Arab claims to 
three disputed islands are hitting back with demands that Tehran revive
its claim to 
Bahrain and consider improving ties with Iraq 
    President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and senior officials strongly
condemned a statement 
last week by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC backing the
United Arab 
Emirates UAE in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands 
    But the newspapers Salam and Jomhuri Eslami demanded that Tehran go
further than 
restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of Abu
Musa Greater Tumb 
and Lesser Tumb 
    It is not very clear why the Sheikh of Bahrain has joined the
others Jomhuri Eslami 
said The GCC groups Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the UAE 
    If historical records are to be the criterion the sheikh of
Bahrain should go about 
his own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain which
belonged to Iran until 
 should be reestablished the paper said 
    It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of
Iran's sovereignty 
over Bahrainand start a serious and effective drive to end the
separation of Bahrain 
from Iran it added 
    The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 
a year before the 
island became an independent state 
    Iranian leaders since the  Islamic revolution have carefully
avoided raising the 
Bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during
periods of 
tension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf 
    Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy of
appeasing proWestern 
Gulf Arab rulers had backfired 
    No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of
the Persian Gulf it 
is the United States and the West which speak the last word it said 
    They the sheikhs are nobody Salam said adding that Iran should
revise its policy 
towards its neighbours especially its former war enemy Iraq 
    Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with
Iraqand going along with 
some Saudibacked trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a role
in the formation of 
the current situation the paper said 
    Ties between Iran and Iraq which fought a war from  to 
improved briefly 
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in  
    But Tehran which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the
ensuing war 
again called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppressed
a Shi'ite Moslem 
revolt which swept southern Iraq after his  defeat in Kuwait

In article spammathsadelaideeduau jaskewspammathsadelaideeduau Joseph Askew writes

 There are Arabs in cabinet but look how long it took and to what
 insignificant positions they are assigned And this is based solely
 on race not political belief or security as Jewish members of the
 same party have always been welcome just not their fellow Arabs

First of all the arab standing in any party or as any party is solely
dependent upon the amount of political power they can wield effectively

It is not a question of an individuals standing When a party puts up
an Arab for a Cabinet post and that Arab is rejected but the position
is given to a Jew from the same party we are not talking about power
but racism 

	Not necessarily  As Shai points out political appointments are
based on power  They are also based on favors owed coalition
building and deal making  While this may have a racist element to
it I think that its much more fair to attribute it to the old boy
nature of politics  Now I'll freely admit that the old boy system
has racist and sexist effects but I don't think that those are its
purpose whether in the US Israel or elsewhere

In the past they have not been effective at garnering votes and forming
a single bloc in the knesset  On the few occasions when this was done
some of the parties took stands that were extremist and ineffect precluded
themselves from forming a coalition and participating in the cabinet

Not their party  them as individuals Even when they belong to nice
peaceful Zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome Arabs are
excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse It
sure looks like racism to me

	Here again you miss out on the old boy nature of politics
and the existance of backroom deals  As individuals these arabs may
not be as well connected as the Jew who gets the job  I don't like
this aspect of politics but I understand it exists

   You appear to be referring to Moshe Dayan  How do you know that the
   evicted Jordanians were not provided with something else  In fact
   this thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did
   not own but received compensation for their loss anyways  Woe to
   Jews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them
   by force with ethnic cleansing of any remaining Jews is
   disgusting and shameful  

Does anyone have a reference to the claim that the Arabs in the
Moghrabi district were squatters  I haven't seen this in the books
I have read  I haven't seen the opposite either

 This issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of
 just one reference probably won't resolve this issue to those that
 oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed Even in your
 location of this one reference you spend most of your quote dealing
 with an incidence that while abhorrant has nothing to do with the 
 issue at hand here Then at the end of the quote there is an almost
 offhand comment that two mosques were destroyed
 
 To support a claim of this nature what other authors support this
 incident If identifiable mosques were destroyed they are certainly
 identifiable they have names and addresses steet location The
 comment by one reporter does make us wonder if this happened but
 by no means proves it
 
 There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of
 mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall That does not mean
 however that once can generalize from this to any other points  The
 entire plaza mosques and all was cleared to make it possible for Jews
 to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of
 them and which had been denied to them for millenia
 
 On the other hand throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel to the
 best of my knowledge Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided
 damage to any Islamic religious sites This contrasts with the policies
 of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and
 bigotry

  Or for that matter with the USA  Around here nobody reroutes
  freeways to avoid churches synagogues and so forth  They just
  get condemned paid off and the road goes through  The same is
  standard policy for any number of other public projects schools
  and sports arenas being only two examples

  Anticipating the objection that the cases aren't comparable how
  not  The Wall has to count as the  tourist attraction in that
  part of the world making room for the traffic would be a twenty
  second decision for any city council I ever heard of

I consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the
right to have a State based on religious belief is a form of racism

Although I don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree Any
discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the
sole qualification for religious membership is racial This is not the
case for Israel although it might get a little closer than say Islam
This of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism Jews
have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in
many Christian countries If we take Russia as an example Jews were
seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the Church
and State stopped at the baptismal font Officially anyway If a Jew
converted there were no legal barriers in his way that I know of anyway
Peter the Great's Interior Minister came from such a convert background
Can we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism
and was not AntiSemitic Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church I
suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief
and AS is after all a form of racism Well maybe not What is
AntiSemitism then if not something racially based I wonder if Hitler
killed converts of 'pure' German blood Does anyone know one way or
the other

  Does anyone know what this is referring to  I seem to have missed it
  Spiked no doubt 
 
  There was something in the NYT and other sources about this for a few
  days  It is an ongoing border disupute and when the Iranians kicked
  out the UAE people it was briefly reported this was many moons ago
  I don't recall reading of any public US comment if it were a strong
  protest I probably would have seen it
 
 Those islands would be Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs I presume
 I don't know about a fourth The latter two islands belong to Iran and so
 
 According to the NY Times the  islands belong to the United Arab
 Emirates

The NY Times is in error This is not simply my opinion even the Arab sources
that I use do not make this claim This of course is assuming that the NY
Times was refering to the islands that I named above Of those islands only
Abu Musa has been in dispute and Iranian occupation of that island predates
the existence of the UAE

	UNITED NATIONS UPI  The Muslimdominated government in Bosnia
Herzegovina asked the UN Security Council Tuesday to withdraw all UN
personnel from Bosnian territory as a first step toward lifting the
international arms embargo against the former Yugoslav republic
	The Bosnian government saying the presence of UN personnel had
become an impediment to critical decisions by the international
community'' indicated the withdrawal of the peacekeepers and relief
workers would persuade Western governments to lift the arms embargo so
Muslims could defend themselves against Bosnian Serbs

	The Security Council imposed the arms embargo on the whole of the
former Yugoslavia in  when fighting erupted between Serb

The imposed it knowing that Serbia has a stockpile of weapons and that
Bosnia will have next to nothing to defend itself Many experts predicted
a Massacre as early as March  but the Security Coucil knew what it
was doing


	France and Britain have opposed US proposals for military air
strikes against Bosnian Serbs saying such strong action would lead to
retaliation against their troops and personnel

	The Bosnian move Tuesday was in part a bid to undermine the British
and French opposition to military intervention based on fears for the
safety of European peacekeeping troops and humanitarian personnel

	Silajdzic's ambassador to the United Nations Mohamed Sacirbey who
conveyed the letter to the Security Council members told reporters that
the peacekeepers' mandate should be modified or they should withdraw

	He said if the Security Council refuses to accede to the request his
government will take another step'' He did not elaborate on what
other steps the government might take

	In his letter to the council Silajdzic said President Clinton
understood well the Muslims' commitment and desperate plight'' because
the United States has been seeking support for lifting of the arms
embargo
	Silajdzic said the international community has not realized that the
war in BosniaHerzegovina was a war of fascist aggression'' and the
maintenance of the arms embargo was an act of arrogant indifference to
the fate of hundreds of thousands of loyal Bosnian citizens who plead
only for the right to defend themselves''
	We beseech the Security Council to cease an arms embargo that has
in practice constituted an international intervention against our
legitimate rights as a member of the United Nations'' Silajdzic said

Now read this Tim Clock co
	The request to the Security Council took some members by surprise
even though the complaints have been aired by the Bosnian government for
some time The only allies the Muslims could find in the council are
            
nonaligned and Islamic countries which have been calling for the

Muslims' right to selfdefense a provision enshrined in the UN
Charter

Let's check it out On page  of this Turkishsuggested reference under
subtitle Deportation and Massacre of Turkish Armenians it states

 Several authors assert that Armenian resistance at Van constituted a key
  factor in the Turkish evacuation of Persia and motivated the Ittihadist
  Young Turk leaders to annihilate the Turkish Armenians The question of
  responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all Ottoman
  Armenians has evolved into a polemic Hundreds of books articles and
  documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence
  and death Many writers such as the British Bryce and Toynbee French Pinon
  German Lepsius American Morganthau and Gibbons have insisted that the
  massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed The have refuted the
  Ottoman government's official publications and justifications by
  substantiating that antiArmenian measures were deliberated by the 
  Ittihadists even before the outbreak of war The fact remains than an 
  estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million Armenians perished within
  a few months and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following
  years to the ravages of disease famine and refugee life Unknown numbers
  of women and children were converted forcibly to Islam possessed by
  Turkish men or adopted by Moslem families

Stanford Shaw is a paid liarrevisionist for the Turkish government and has
been exposed as a plagiarizer For example

Experts from an interview in Greek with Professor Spyros Vryonis from NYC's
National Herald  Thanks Mr GB

 Few people know of the problem I faced at UCLA when Professor Stanford
  Shaw was due for promotion I knew him to be Turkey's man due to my
  reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him I was a member
  of the promotion committee For that case I sat down and read his entire
  treatise History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey It took me
  three months and I found out from volume I that he had plagiarized 
  Uzun Jarsoglu an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history Shaw
  himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome 
  of a year search through the Ottoman Archives Well I went on leave  
  and managed to show  of Volume I containing around  sentences 
  to be the result of plagiarism matching each sentence with passages    
  from the original work He had even reproduced the errors So I produced a
  pages manuscript and submitted a pages report on Shaw's plagiarism 

  The University however rejected my report and after a closed meeting
  promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor I paid a price for 
  all this upset by the whole process I confronted the entire University
  structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman I asked for
  permission to run a seminar on Shaw's book that was denied by the President
  of the University While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me
  permission the President was depriving me of my academic freedom Luckily
  the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar attended by more 
  than  academic people in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw who refused
  to attend As a punishment the University froze all my raises

I dont think you're correct here There have been no reports of the Bosnians
Muslims supporting the Nazis in their genocide against the Serbians The fact is
that the Croat govt using their secret police called the Ustache I think
were the prime agents of the Nazis in Yugoslavia against the Serbs

I like what Mr Joseph Biden had to say yesterday  in the senate

Condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans 
and calling that moral rape

He went on to say that the reason for that is out right religious BIGOTRY

Parts of Sen Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today

   Let me put it plainly Mr Secretary  You are required to speak
   diplomatically I am not  I cannot even begin to express to you
   my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to 
   participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory
   
   What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference
   timidity selfdelusion and hypocrisy
   
   After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia they are asking us
   to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the
   right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe
   havens' for the Bosnians
   Let's not mince words  European policy is based on cultural and
   religious indifference if not bigotry  And I think it's fair to say
   that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims
   were doing what the Serbs have done if this was Muslim aggression
   instead of Serbian aggression

Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence which 
pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger
within the Islamic world the consequences of which we cannot begin
to predict  Later Biden told a reporter why he spoke out

   I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear
   this is a big deal so they will understand

and it IS a big deal  By refusing the fundamental human right of
selfdefense to BosniaHerzegovina Europe and the world have 
aided the Serbian aggression  Moreover the arms embargo has
forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have  times more heavy
weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined  Under such
conditions it is very easy for Serbs to play a divideandconquer
game and to get the Muslims and Croats who have strong common
interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression 
to start fighting each other which leads to their mutual catastrophe

One final quote  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher has
said in Rome last week that In practice the embargo had the opposite
effect intended  It made aggression certain

All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace
while enforcing a  imbalance of power on the ground have contributed
to this tragedy


Sincerely
Josip

  There are Arabs in cabinet but look how long it took and to what
  insignificant positions they are assigned And this is based solely
  on race not political belief or security as Jewish members of the
  same party have always been welcome just not their fellow Arabs
 
 First of all the arab standing in any party or as any party is solely
 dependent upon the amount of political power they can wield effectively
 
 It is not a question of an individuals standing When a party puts up an
 Arab for a Cabinet post and that Arab is rejected but the position is given
 to a Jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism
 Would you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with Labour
 coalitions

Please cite specific examples where an Arab party member was rejected
while a Jewish party member was accepted  If you examine these I am
sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power
base that his Jewish counterpart had  The party structure in Israel
has changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go  Knesset
members for most parties are now elected via primaries  The top standing
members end up with cabinet posts  This is purely a political power
issue  Check the ranking of Arab labor party members as opposed
to Jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by Jews that
ranked lower in the party than their Arab fellow electees

Once again if for arguments sake all the Arab Israelis were to vote
for Labor at the next election you can rest assured that the number of
Arab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the
power shift

 Not their party  them as individuals Even when they belong to nice
 peaceful Zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome Arabs are
 excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse It
 sure looks like racism to me

You are overlooking the fact that they wield political power
as individuals based upon a wider collective power base

 Arabs are excluded from cabinet even when they do the things you
 suggest because they are Arabs Unless of course you have a better
 reason I am happy to listen to any good reason why a leftist Jew
 is less of a security risk than a leftist Arab from the same party
 Look at the present cabinet

The reasoning I see at work is purely political  As far as security
goes I think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing Jews
as well  eg Sharon

Mohamed

Biden spoke well  Then there was John Major the architect of the
betrayal of Bosnian Muslims to genocide  

He basically has given yet another green light to HVO Ustashe and
MladicChetnik serial killers rapists and plunderers to continue their
genocide against Bosnian Muslims

But Major met with Mr Rushdie and said it was unacceptable that Iran
should have a death decree on him  While I disagree personally with
Fetwas against hack writers like Rushdie it only helps them sell more
books I find it interesting that Mr Major finds the genocide of two
million Muslims in Bosnia acceptable but a threat against one single
popular British writer unacceptable

Actually just after the FIRST world war many Muslims were killed by Serbs
Under Serbianled regime between the two world wars many Croats were
also killed especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan  
Some Croats formed a resistance movement Ustashas Insurgents and
were forced into exile to fascist Italy which sheltered them  In exile
they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia while Croats in
Croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership
of Vladko Macek  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world
war Vladko Macek refused to collaborate so Ustashas were brought in 
to run the newly formed puppet state  This state included both Croatia and
BosniaHerzegovina and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats
flowers of Croatian people  Some Muslims in BosniaHerzegovina
therefore joined Ustashas  However even more others did not they
joined Tito's Partisans    The Ustashas membership peaked at 
less than  of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time

After WWII Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended
from Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago  But in 
it was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as
either Serbs or Croats is not a good policy  Dobrica Cosic the current
president of the rump Yugoslavia was strongly opposed and sought to
prevent the category Muslim in an ethnic sense from appearing on the
next census  He was criticized and expelled from the party  So since
that time Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality although
some still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat
nationality

Sincerely
Josip

My recollection of HistoryDocumentary books is slitely different
It is my understanding that Croats were allies of Germany during
WWII while Serbs had sided with Russia  As a result Serbs did
take a beating from Croats NOT Bosnian Moslems while Germany
had the upper hand

Even today Russians considercall Serbs as their Slovac brothers
This is one of the issues involved in the UN's lack of active
intervention against Serbs

As for the Bosnian Moslems I have not heard of any alliance with
Germany or Russia in recent history  Therefore I am curious
if they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict
with same brutallity as they are getting it today in the past
history

do change your cultural identity and lose that part of you which was
Jewish


I would change one of the many parts that define my cultural identity
If I loose a leg it might change my personality but I do not
stop being a human being 
Even more when someone gets a baboon heart that person is still
human


To be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not
by my religion Actually if I am an atheist which is in fact like 
converting into a nonJewish in terms of religion I am still considered as
part of the Jewish Nation

	No there is a serious cultural and religios difference
between renouncing the jewish god and accepting a new one  Thou
shall have no other gods before me  Conversion is a violation of
this atheism you might be able to wiggle around with

Not really That is what differenciates agnostics from atheists
As an atheist I do not believe there is a god nor do I believe that
there ever was one
So those commandments have no meaning to me Also there are a lot
of ideas that have no meaning to me The idea of a chosen people
the idea of a given right to the land of Israel the idea of keeping
kosher the idea of opposing intermarriage the idea of having a 
Torah that was inspired by god etc 
By being an atheist I cannot support the idea of the Jewish Nation
as defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity
For me religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural
identity of the Jewish people I believe that as a people with a 
cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as
any other people in the world to have their own State The same right
as the Armenians have as the Palestinians have as the French have
and as anybody else have
I cannot say that by accepting a different god someone has lost all 
cultural identification

I consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the
right to have a State based on religious belief is a form of racism

Although I don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree Any
discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the
sole qualification for religious membership is racial 

In the same way in which antisemite means antiJewish and not antiall
personsofwhoaresemite a form of racism means A form of segregation
against all those who are different based on the religious identification

I like what Mr Joseph Biden had to say yesterday  in the senate

Condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans 
and calling that moral rape


It is easy for Sen Biden to say that when there are no US troops in
Zepa or Srebinica or Sarejevo

The existing UN policy may certaining be wrong but the US wants
to dictate policy and make Europe responsible for the consequences
of that policy

Bosnia is a big enough problem for the US to preach about what
other countries should be doing with their forcesbut its forces
are safely tucked away at home in the US

  Under such
conditions it is very easy for Serbs to play a divideandconquer
game and to get the Muslims and Croats who have strong common


It is the Serbs who were divided when Croatia and BosniaHercegovina 
attempted to secede from Yugoslavia ripping more than  Serbs
and their property out of Yugoslavia  

The Croatian and Muslim nations had the right to secede not the Republics
Additionally the secessions were to be negotiated which would probably
have required international mediation instead the secessions were illegal
unilateral and acts of war against Yugoslavia and those who did not
want to be ripped out of Yugoslavia by the secessions

                           THE ENEMY WITHIN
                           
                        By Robert I Friedman
         The Village Voice May   Vol XXXVIII No 

         How The  AntiDefamation League  Turned the Notion 
         of Human Rights on Its Head Spying  on  Progress 
         ives and  Funneling Information to Law Enforcement 


Roy Bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in Indiana and
read I Led Three Lives Herbert Philbrick's Cold War saga of
penetrating the Communist Party for the FBI  Philbrick had become an
American folk hero in the s for building dossiers on unsuspecting
colleagues  It was a time when Hollywood produced more than  films
portraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot  In
Boston where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant Communist
Party member and private citizen the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert
Philbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque

For Bullock a shy young man who was coming to terms with his
homosexuality in the straightarrow 's the life of a double agent
was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist
menace

I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick Bullock recently told
federal investigators and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the
Communist Part  In  I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student
Festival in Moscow with the American delegation  I gave them the FBI
a full report on it when I returned along with some photos I took of
some Soviet military vehicles

Bullock was hooked  For the next two years he worked as an unpaid
informant for the FBI  But he found his true calling when he became a
paid spy for the AntiDefamation League in   Now his activities
are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent
American history  a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminal
indictment in San Francisco

Over a year period he compiled computer files for the ADL on 
individuals and more than  groups of all political stripes
including the NAACP the Rainbow Coalition ACLU the American Indian
Movement the Center for Investigative Reporting Pacifica ACT UP
Palestinian and Arab groups Sandinista solidarity groups Americans
for Peace Now and antiapartheid organizations  Bullock who even
spied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when
he visited the Bay Area in April  sold many of his ADL files on
antiapartheid activists to South African intelligence  Meanwhile
between  and  the ADL paid him nearly  using a
prominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its
financial relationship with Bullock

Last month police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San
Francisco as well as Bullock's home confiscating computer files and
boxes of documents  According to court records Bullock's files
contained the driver's license and vehicle registration information
in addition to criminal histories on individuals  much of which was
allegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers  Bullock  told
the FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base
had been given to the San Francisco ADL office  Based on the
evidence says Inspector Ron Roth in a police affidavit I believe
that Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them
with confidential criminal and DMV information

What's more the San Francisco DA is investigating Bullock for
tapping phones accessing answering machines and assuming false
identities to infiltrate organizations  Documents seized from
Bullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area
trash cans He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the
Christic Institute in San Francisco as well as telephone message
slips to staff members including names and phone numbers of callers
office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the
senders and interoffice memos  He also had receipts from Christic
Institute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings
as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees the
dates and amounts  Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic
Institute's checking account

Investigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed
that the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material
with Israeli government officials  What's more Israel apparently used
tips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there

                                      

The ADL was established in New York City in  to defend Jews and
later other minority groups from discrimination  It led the fight
against racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the
American Nazi Party and in the s championed the civil rights
movement

But there was also a darker side  In the late s the ADL spied on
leftists and Communists and shared investigative files with the House
Committee on UnAmerican Activities and the FBI  The ADL swung
sharply to the right during the Reagan administration becoming a
bastion of neoconservatism  To Irwin Suall a repentant Trotskyite
who heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department the real danger
to Jews is posed not by the right  but by a coalition of leftists
blacks and Arabs who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in
America as well as the state of Israel  In the tradition of his
ideological soulmate William Casey Suall directed the ADL's vast
network of informants who were given code names like Scumbag
Ironside and  for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta
 Flipper

For years journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community
knew the ADL spied on rightwing hate groups  As long as the targets
were antiSemitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon
Larouche no one seemed to be particularly troubled  But the Bullock
case reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent
and progressive orientation  This apparent massive violation of civil
liberties may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco
where the investigation began  The human rights group faces possible
criminal prosecution on as many as  felony counts including an
indictment for gaining illegal access to police computers  Says one
source close to the West Coast investigation It is  per cent
certain that the ADL will be indicted

In the wake of the San Francisco investigation police probes of ADL
spying are spreading to other parts of the country  We have received
numerous complaints about ADL spying says Sam Adams a
spokesperson for the mayor's office in Portland Oregon

On April  the Harlembased Black United Fund of New York and
African American selfhelp group that Bullock allegedly spied on
wrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau requesting an immediate
investigation of the ADL  The ADL's actions cause great concern as
it is a direct and flagrant violation  at minimum  of our civil
rightsWe call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San
Francisco tobring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism

Gerald McKelvey a spokesperson for Morgenthau's office says We
have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation
McKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San
Francisco DA's office on their pending investigation  They have
not so far asked for our assistance

The ADL acknowledges sharing information on violenceprone groups with
law enforcement officials  It also admits to maintaining extensive
files on a wide variety of organizations but says in a twopage
press release The vast majority of ADL's files are composed of news
clips magazine articles books journals and other documents

ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance
violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency
and the process by which the League gathers information is presently
under review to insure that no laws are being violated

That's what the ADL says for public consumption  But morale is so low
that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits  And
even as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show
of solidarity many do so holding their noses  More than a few Jewish
officials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human
rights group or a secret police agency

The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the
Jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti
Semitism and extremist groups says Daniel Levitas the former
executive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal an Atlanta
based group that monitors antiSemitism racism and hate groups
One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely
tainted the ADL's credibility and reputation with regard to its
objectivity  This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the
Jewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous
with American Jewry

                                      

Bullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well
with the ADL's Cold War worldview  In  he moved to Southern
California where he became an ADL spy for  a week  Bullock
almost always used his real name when snooping although he once
called himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of
Alabama governor George Wallace  Bullock provided the ADL's office in
Los Angeles with written reports which were transmitted to Fact
Finding Department head Irwin Suall according to court records
Under Suall's stewardship Fact Finding Department had become the
ADL's heart and soul  Located at ADL national headquarters across
from the United Nations the department had assembled a vast library
on hate groups culling material from publications speeches and
informants reports

Bullock was more than adept at leading a double life  Not long after
moving to California he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John
Birch Society who helped him gain access to the group's Boston office
There he found a file the rightwingers were keeping on the ADL  The
discovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that
they had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers

Bullock focused almost exclusively on rightwing extremist groups
until the early s when ADL LA head Milton Sinn was replaced by
Harvey Schechter who encouraged him to target the left as well  A
few years later Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco
where he posed as an art dealer  And ADL fact finder who had
infiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed  When the
ensuing scandal died down Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate
the Arabs

The ADL was especially concerned about the AmericanArab Anti
Discrimination Committee founded by the former South Dakota senator
James Abourezk to combat Arabbashing  In a page out of the CIA's
dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization Bullock
joined the ADC and then recruited Nazis into the group apparently
trying to discredit it according to published reports

In  the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of
Arab Americans annual congress in Washington  According to court
documents Bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds
Bullock was unable to follow the money  But he did such a good job
at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA
delegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi

It's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations  But
only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP  As
far as Bullock was concerned gay groups in San Francisco were heavily
infiltrated by what he called gay left revolutionaries prompting
him to write about their activities for the ADL

Bullock soon expanded his horizons moving into the shadowy realm of
foreign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut the head of ADL's San
Francisco office introduced him to Thomas Gerard in   Gerard was
then a detective with the San Francisco Police Department's
Intelligence Unit  Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the
CIA in El Salvador in the early s where he apparently had more
than a passing interest in rightwing death squads  Police searching
Gerard's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and
interrogation photos of blindfolded and chained men as well as
passports made out to Gerard in  different names including Thomas
Clouseau  From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines
where he fled last November Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he
will blow the lid off the CIA's involvement with Latin American death
squads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case

After their very first encounter in the ADL office Gerard and Bullock
had lunch at McDonald's I liked Tom right off Bullock later told a
San Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation
was obtained by the Voice  Tom is a very charming roguish
character with a great deal of integrity  Let me say here I
consider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I've ever worked
with absolutely  Honest capable intelligent and  percent
American

Before long Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL
reports on various groups and individuals  In turn Gerard gave
Bullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans
skinheads and others  Bullock told the FBI that Gerard's material
ended up in his ADL reports  I would say  percent of the data that
I got was name address and sometimes physical description  Criminal
history very rarely Bullock told investigators  Gerard also gave
Bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American
businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East
terror groups as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans
receiving weapons training overseas  Bullock claims that US Customs
in New York gave Gerard the photos  It was understood that Bullock
would be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard
gave him and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or
other law enforcement officers says an FBI report

There was nothing unusual about Bullock's cozy relationship with law
enforcement  By the mids the ADL was swapping files with
hundreds of official friends the organization's euphemism for US
law enforcement and intelligence sources  The ADL's relationship with
the FBI's counterterrorism office was so close that ADL's reports on
Arab American group's covert ties to Middle East terrorists were must
reading

It's no accident that police found a  classified FBI report
entitled Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine PFLPNew
York Area while searching the ADL's San Francisco office  In 
ADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in
California universities on student visas  When the ADL discovered
they were disseminating PFLP literature it informed the FBI which in
turn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
After the INS ordered the students deported as subversives ADL
regional director David Lehrer gloated in the Los Angeles Times
about his office's cooperation with law enforcement although he's
backpedaling now  The Los Angeles  deportation is still under
appeal

                                      

While the ADL worked quietly with America's top cops it enjoyed
similar ties with Israel's spy agencies  a charge that ADL leaders
vehemently deny  But as early as July   ADL director Benjamin
Epstein wrote to B'nai B'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes
requesting  for his investigators  Our information he
boasted to Joftes in addition to being essential for our own
operations has been of great value and service to both the United
States Department and the Israeli Government  All data have been made
available to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are
the source

In  the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard
spy scandal  While assigned to the Navy's AntiTerrorist Alert
Center where he had access to the most closely guarded US secrets
Jonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for
Israel which according to federal prosecutors could fill a room
the size of a large closetten feet by six feet by six feet
Pollard's handler was Avi Sella an Israeli air force colonel whose
wife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer  Pollard later wrote to
friends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli
spy operation

While there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was
involved with Pollard there is evidence that the ADL freely passes
information to Israeli intelligence  In March  the FBI
interrogated David Gurvitz an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until
 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police
information to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center
The FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information
to Israel  Gurvitz admitted that in  he had learned from a law
enforcement contact that Michael Elias allegedly a member of a
radical PLO faction was scheduled to travel from San Francisco
International Airport en route to Haifa  Gurvitz phoned the deputy
Israeli consul general in LA with the information  Later the same
day according to a page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the
Voice Gurvitz was called back by another man who said he was from
the Israeli Consulate and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information
about Elias  Gurvitz did not get this man's name but their
conversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was
actually an Israeli Consulate official

Among the  names of private citizens that police found in ADL
files in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad a yearold Chicago
resident who was arrested in Israel on January  for allegedly
distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas the large
Islamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories  The
Chicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work
with official friends in local law enforcement according to
documents released by the San Francisco DA and sources close to the
ADL  Given these facts Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has
passed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence

One technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American
community in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral
notices  According to sources familiar with the practice ADL
investigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals
which sometimes turned into PLO rallies  Palestinians have been
detained at BenGurion Airport simply on the basis of having been
filmed attending a funeral in Chicago according to Suhail Miari the
executive director of the United Holy Land Fund whose cousin was an
Arab member of Israel's Knesset

Shortly after Jarad was arrested the Israeli government announced
that Hamas was being run from America with money and operational
instructions relayed by courier or fax  Israel's charges were played
up on the front page of The New York Times  According to well
placed sources Yehudit Barsky an ADL fact finder in New York worked
closely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification
introducing friendly reporters to official friends in Chicago law
enforcement

Barsky who is fluent in Arabic prepared an ADL report about how
Hamas is funded in America  She identified the Dallasbased Islamic
association for Palestine in North America as the front organization
for Hamas in the USA  Its infrastructure functions as an
interlocking network of organizations small businesses and
individual activists says the February  ADL report which
outlines the organization's development its activities on US
college campuses and its metamorphosis during the Gulf War It
also traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front
groups from Plainfield Indiana to Culver City California  It is
doubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data
without the help of official friends and ADL spies

Barsky refused to comment  But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as
many as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for
AIPAC whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the Voice
The level of cooperation was very close Slabodkin said during a
recent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school
If we felt our files were lacking we contacted the ADL

When Sha'wan Jabarin a yearold Palestinian human rights worker in
the Occupied Territories won a  Reebok Human Rights Award in
 Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man's entire
police file which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy  Jabarin
had been arrested numerous times in Israel and once confessed to
being a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured
Jabarin who received a short jail term became an Amnesty
International Prisoner of Conscience  Of course to AIPAC and the
ADL Jabarin was a terrorist  Slabodkin who was ordered to keep tabs
on him when he was in the US to receive his award called a
representative of Al Haq the Palestinian human rights group that
employed Jabarin to obtain his itinerary  AIPAC even opened a file
on musician Jackson Browne who presented Jabarin with the Reebok
award

While the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of
Arabs and even leftwing gay revolutionaries it has a far harder
time explaining its obsession with spying on antiapartheid activists
David Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact
finder for the ADL in LA in March  ADL files already bulged
with information about the IsraelSouth African connection and anti
apartheid groups  Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely
collect information on persons engaged in antiapartheid activities in
the United States says the FBI report  While Gurvitz said there
were files in the LA ADL office dating to the s he estimated
the oldest material on antiapartheid activities dates back to the
late s paralleling Begin's rise to power in Israel and a
deepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa In
about August  says the report of the FBI's March  
interview with Gurvitz an antiapartheid demonstration was held at
the South African Consulate in Los Angeles  Participating in the
demonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist
Workers Party  Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions
and a subsequent demonstration  He wrote a report for the ADL on each
of the planning sessions and on the demonstration  Copies of the
reports were disseminated to Bullock among others in care of the San
Francisco ADL office

In  Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African
Consulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting
organized by Willis Carto the head of the antiSemitic Liberty Lobby
Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is
says the FBI report Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want
to warn the South Africans  Gerard agreed and informed the Consul
General who canceled his appearance

A few months later Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African
intelligence officer wanted to meet them  During a rendezvous in a
hotel near Fisherman's Wharf the South African said he was interested
in acquiring information on American antiapartheid activists  The
South African who called himself Mr Humphries also asked for
information about groups that were advocating divestments  Gerard
who was present throughout the meeting says the FBI report told
Humphries that he Gerard had been employed by the CIAHumphries
offered to pay Bullock  per month in exchange for information
Bullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted
was already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL

Between  and  Bullock sold information to South African
intelligence receiving steady raises which he split evenly with
Gerard  Bullock said it was his impression though Gerard never
explicitly told him so and Bullock never asked that Gerard may have
been telling the CIA about his and Bullock's contacts with the South
Africans says the FBI report  Gerard had said he knew the CIA
'resident agent' in San FranciscoOnce after Gerard dropped
Bullock off at Bullock's residence following a meeting with Louie who
replaced Humphries as their handler Gerard said he was going to go
to the San Francisco CIA office

Al the while Gerard may have been tasking Bullock for the CIA
Bullock recalled that once after he had met Gerard Bullock went to
Chicago Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL
says the FBI report  The target of the investigation was a group
called the Palestine Human Rights Campaign  Bullock learned that a
woman name deleted was transporting money between the PLO or the
PFLP and the United States  Bullock told this to Gerard  Gerard
later told Bullock that Gerard's 'guy at the CIA' would like to know
more  Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to
gather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign
Bullock however never did go back

Gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad which
may have started in  when he went on an ADL junket to Israel  The
ADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials
to Israel where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts
in various intelligence agencies  According to an affidavit by San
Francisco police inspector Roth the allexpense paid trip to
Israel was more or less a thankyou gift and a liaison gesture by the
ADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law
enforcement officers from the United States

Gerard may have liked what he saw in Israel  A short time after
travelling there he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad's
rescue of Ethiopian Jews

As Gerard's relationship with South Africa deepened he talked more
openly about his exploits in the CIA  Bullock recalled Gerard
mentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business and that
Gerard discussed the PLO and 'safehouses' says the FBI report To
this Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined
that the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating
Gerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan
Louie also told Gerard and Bullock about his adventures inside South
Africa as an intelligence officer  Both Gerard and Louie traded 'war
stories' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of 'narrow
scrapes'

Although there is still much mystery about what triggered law
enforcement's investigation of the ADL it was probably the theft of
a classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI's San
Francisco office  Police armed with search warrants recovered the
report in the ADL San Francisco office  Gurvitz says he had sent a
copy of it to Mira Boland the director of the ADL's fact finding
division in Washington DC  Boland was preparing an oped piece for
The Washington Times in which she argued that the Nation of Islam
should not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of LA
because the group is antiSemitic and violenceprone  Boland who
had arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard
testified in a  criminal trial in Roanoke Virginia that she had
worked for the CIA for  months and later was a subcontractor for the
Defense Department before joining the ADL  During the trial Boland
admitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation
only ADL conference

After he was questioned by the FBI last fall Gerard fled to the
Philippines which has no extradition treaty with America  Gerard is
believed to have supplied information from police computers not only
to the ADL but to Israel and South Africa as well  The San
Francisco Examiner reported that Gerard may be charged with violating
federal espionage laws

Although Bullock worked for the ADL for  years and Irwin Suall
praised him in a July  memo as our number one investigator the
ADL now argues that he was a rogue agent  In its own defense the ADL
also asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than
journalists  After all ask ADL officials don't journalists keep
files

But the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL's
method of gathering information couldn't be more striking
Journalists place information in the public domain where they are held
accountable for falsehoods distortions and libel  And for the most
part journalists don't share their investigative files with foreign
and domestic police agencies  The ADL has no such inhibition
Because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny false
information collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be
corrected  Once a proud human rights group the ADL has become the
Jewish thought police

The ADL says it's a human rights group not just for Jews but for
everyone says Chip Berlet a highly respected researcher at the
Massachusettsbased Political Research Associates which monitors
rightwing extremist groups  That's fine but it can't do that and
spy on Palestinians  It's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral

My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats  Each of the
hats independently is appropriate  It is a broadbased human rights
group that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination
It is a group that defends Jews against defamation  Entirely noble
Nothing wrong with that hat  It is a group whose leaders at least
consistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics which
again is entirely appropriate  And it is a group that maintains an
informationsharing arrangement with law enforcement  Again there is
nothing wrong for a group to do that

But you can't do all four  It is impossible to do all four and not
violate the bounds of ethics  There's a builtin conflict of interest
if you wear all four hats

ADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict
In a September   letter to the Voice Foxman complained ADL
has a proud year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil
rights and constitutional freedoms  Any imputation of an effort or
motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is
false and baseless

Throughout his pieces on AIPAC's spying Friedman describes the
dissemination of information as if it were slander and the existence
of files as a token of McCarthyite inclination  The depiction is
misleading in several ways  Virtually every journalist academic
politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem
relevant tracing the logic of Friedman's reckless charges the
Library of Congress is tantamount to the KGB  Moreover disseminating
the public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor
McCarthyism

But many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business
Ask Jesse Jackson James Abourezk or the leaders of the New Jewish
Agenda  all past targets of ADL smears  At the same time the ADL
exonerated the fascist World AntiCommunist League which assisted
Ronald Reagan's covert war against Nicaragua a policy endorsed by ADL
leaders

In the early s researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet
fact finding head Irwin Suall to discuss their work on antiSemite
Lyndon LaRouche  Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this
really terrific investigator says Berlet  So we introduce
ourselves say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and
basically runs down a dossier on each of us about what our political
activities are who we work with what organizations we belong to
Obviously he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds
admirably  We were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling
very uncomfortable

And then he leans forward and says 'The rightwing isn't the
problem  The leftwing is the problem  The Soviet Union is the
biggest problem in the world for Jews  It's the American left that is
the biggest threat to American Jews  You're on the wrong track
You're part of the problem'  We were stunned  I was virtually in
tears  This is not how I perceived myself  We basically stumbled out
of there in a daze



               Letters response to Friedman's article

         The Village Voice May   Vol XXXVIII No 

A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN

Robert I Friedman's assault on the AntiDefamation League The Anti
Defamation League Is Spying On You May  demonstrates that he has
an axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote
It also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down
on his list  The story is replete with inaccuracies innuendos and
outright falsehoods and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from
reality as to be farcical  Friedman is even wrong on such basic
easily determined facts as where ADL was founded Chicago not New
York and the building in which ADL'S San Francisco office is located
not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured

ADL has done the work of fighting haters for  years without
spying on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for
the law  Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti
Jewish racist antidemocratic and violenceprone and we monitor
them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings
Through the years we have published scores of reports on anti
Semitism emanating from both the left and the right  In fact
although Friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary ADL's
primary concern is still the far right

Because extremist organizations are highly secretive sometimes ADL
can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources
Friedman's hyperbole notwithstanding these sources function in a
manner directly analogous to investigative journalists  Some have
performed great service to the American people  for example by
uncovering the existence of rightwing extremist paramilitary training
camps  with no recognition and at considerable personal risk  The
information ADL obtains is placed in the public domain and through
the years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting

Friedman's article by contrast contains so much misinformation that
it would take an article equally as long to set the record straight
A few examples  He states that an ADL leader was deeply involved in
the Jonathan Pollard Israeli spy operation and that Pollard's
handler's wife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer  Not true
Friedman also states  ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped
Palestinian funerals  Not true  Elsewhere he asserts that ADL was
obsessed with spying on antiapartheid activists  Again not true
We could go on and on  and of course Friedman does not reveal
his sources

The distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further
reveal his lack of objectivity  When it comes to how much ADL paid
Roy Bullock a week  as an independent contractor not an employee
an important distinction Friedman also fails to make  he includes
the zeros   inviting the reader to see a large
number  By contrast when he observes that ADL paid Bullock nearly
 between  and  he chooses not to point out that
amounts to little more than  a year  hardly an excessive sum

What is accurate about Friedman's story is Chip Berlet's description
of ADL's four hats  Yes ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and
discrimination  Yes ADL defends Israel against critics  And yes
ADL maintains an informationsharing relationship with law enforcement
regarding extremist activities and hate crimes  We see no conflict in
these four activities and we believe most Voice readers won't
either

ROBERT I FRIEDMAN REPLIES

For the ADL to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd
Journalists don't spy on Arabs and antiapartheid activists and then
freely pass their files to South African and Israeli intelligence
But according to police the confessions of two paid ADL investigators
buttressed by  pages of court documents and interviews the ADL
does  Indeed the ADL spies on groups that are neither antiSemitic
nor violent  Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstream
groups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Now  Respected intellectuals and
Middle East scholars who disagree with the ADL's political views have
ended up on ADL blacklists their reputations smeared  Private
organizations have no business paying operatives inside police
departments or having spies says an April  editorial in the St
Louis PostDispatch condemning ADL spying  On April  police
armed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco and
LA after concluding that ADL employees were apparently less than
truthful in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier
search according to San Francisco police inspector Ron Roth's sworn
affidavit  Roth also asserts that Bullock was a paid employee for
the ADL  If so by failing to pay taxes on  of income paid
to Bullock the ADL could face a total of  felony counts according
to court papers  The ADL may also face felony charges for illegally
obtaining confidential information from police computers  As for
errors  The ADL was founded in Chicago and moved to New York in
  But it was an original tenant in the San Francisco building
shown in the Voice photo moving out a few months ago  I never
wrote that an ADL leader was deeply involved in the Pollard
Israeli spy operation  I reported that Pollard himself made the
charge  And in court papers Pollard's own lawyer said that the wife
of Pollard's handler worked for the ADL  If I have a bias it is on
the side of the First and Fourth Amendments

Gerald


Look nobody asked those countries about their UN forces
to be on the ground  They can take their forces which are
incomponent and ineffective at the first place  And let whoever are
willing to do the job what it takes  How anyone can defend this
stinking UN force on the ground who let the Bosnnian PM
yanked out from the UN vehicle and being shot by the Serbian
military  How anyone can defend this UN force who are just watching
the shelling on cities and towns everyday  How anyone can
defend and say those stinking UN forces being effective
when Bosnian had almost  children casualties between  age 
groups  I think talking about the current UN forces to Bosnian
muslims is just an insult to their casualties   

I think Senator Biden said it all what has to be said on this issue
Europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this 
world  Like Biden said they are the bigots when it comes to 
cultural difference and minorty closer to their home
Because they get rid of their minorities long long time
ago starting in th centuries  And they let Adolph
to take care of the rest in th Century  But he was much more 
naughty than they expected because he dared to step many 
toes  So why spoil the good thing now when Serbs doing today what 
they were thinking the same yesterday

	As the the peace talks resume in the Middle East I would humbly
like to make some personal observations as to their prospects of success
or failure and what's at stake

	The present talks were suspended for over  months after the
Israeli expulsion of more the  palestinians for alleged links with
the extremist Islamic organisation Hamas  The future of the talks was
in the balance and their continuance was only guaranteed after some
concessions by Israel  Now that all the parties are back to the
negotiating table the stakes as I see is are indeed high and the future
stability of the region and perhaps the world is in the balance

	The resumption of the talks was followed by a goodwill gesture
by Israel involving the return of  exiled Palestinians from Jordan to
the Occupied Territories  These however were not the Palestinians
expelled in December  The group constituted intellectuals and
professionals who had been exiled after the ' war for the political
stand which was then regarded as dangerous

	The choice of these Arabs who support the peace talks
illustrates the dilemma now faced by Israel  Its erstwhile arch
enemies ie PLO and its backers now seem willing to talk peace while a
new wave of Islamic fundamantalism sweeping the Middle East has seen the
rise of an even more implacable foe under the banner of Hamas  

	While Israel continues to refuse to talk to the PLO labelling
it a terrorist organisation the window of opportunity for peace is
narrowing by the day  If the present talks are allowed to deadlock
without agreement for a long term and lasting peace that taken into
account the interest of all involved the chances of peace will indeed
receed  The PLO by its decision to rejoin the talks has staked its
reputation on the success of the talks  The longer the talks continue
and they started  and half years ago without any tangible progress
the further will the PLO support in the territories erode

	What is urgently needed is some dramatic gesture worked out by
Israel with US approval that could spur the peace process and force the
Arabs and Palestinians to reciprocate  Vague promises as to interim
government and return of territories is evidently too little too late to
be any good  You might ask why must the Israelis and not the Arabs make
the first substantive moves  The answer must lie in the tenous support
at best that the talks receive among the mass of Arab people and the
fact the Israel holds the most important cards namely land  

If a land for peace agreement can be reached and real soon the chances
of a comprehensive peace treaty is good  The Arabs once and for all
recognise Israel's right to exist inside secure borders and Isreal
would in turn recognise the legitimate right of the Palestinians to self
deternimation and statehood  With peace guarantee by air tight
treaties the region can then hope to dwell on the economic and social
well being of its population rather than prepare for the next war

Ram Vikash Tiwary                      

As we see right now the position of influence enjoyed by parties favoring
the negotiation process is tenuous at best The local elections in Hebron
that the PLO was expected to win perhaps adding a bit to its flagging
position of legitimacy in the eyes of Palestinians and the Middle East
have been disrupted by Hamas actions overtly directed towards
undermining those and all West Bank elections The present ruling Israeli 
Labor coalition seems to be one rather thin political ice The Palestinian
delegation has been reduced from  to three to protest Israel lack of
seriousness in the talks and refusal to reverse all the deportations
immediately

Hopefully however each of the parties will begin to learn that just
the fact that negotiations are taking place does not mean they are giving 
anything away to the other side which wasis the favorite argument of 
the rejectionists Let's hope that discusion and inevitable disagreement
on major issues leads at the same time to some agreement on smaller
interim phase whatever term we prefer steps to be taken

       Not necessarily  As Shai points out political appointments are
based on power  They are also based on favors owed coalition
building and deal making

Actually I am not sure you have understood what I have said On several
occasions a minor party has put up an Arab for a Cabinet position That
is the major party Labour in this case has agreed that a minor party
can have so many seats and that party nominates an Arab for one This is
not acceptable to the major party which insists on the minor party
appointing a Jew The favours owed deals done have all been settled
What remains is exactly who is going to sit in Cabinet The party that
gets the seat wants an Arab but that is not acceptable This is racism
It has nothing to do with politics at all

any case a fascinating piece of analysis Here are the facts


Source Walker Christopher Armenia The Survival of a Nation
        New York St Martin's Press 

This generally proArmenian work contains the following information
of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust 

a Dro the butcher the former dictator of xSoviet Armenia and the 
architect of the genocide of  million Muslims the most respected 
of Nazi Armenian leaders established an Armenian Provisional Republic 
in Berlin during World War II 

b this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social 
theories of the Nazis declared themselves and all Armenians to be members 
of the Aryan 'SuperRace' 

c they published an AntiSemitic racist journal thereby aligning themselves 
with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews and 

d they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to  members which fought side 
by side with the Wehrmacht

 
In fact by  Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast 
network of proGerman collaborators that extended over two continents 
Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and WaffenSS in 
Russia and Western Europe Armenians were involved in espionage and 
fifthcolumn activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula 
They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in 
an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council' A copy of 
this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record' November  
 see Document  On this side of the Atlantic Nazi Armenians 
were aware of their brethrens alliance They had often expressed 
proNazi sentiments until America entered the war


In  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi
concentration camps the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first
Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis In  this battalion 
had grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of Dro 
the butcher who was the former dictator of xSoviet Armenia and the 
architect of the coldblooded genocide of  million Turks and Kurds 
between  An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious 
Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis Encouraged 
by this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of 
extermination of the Jews

This ArmenianNazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they backstabbed and
exterminated  million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army

  and who copied the months of the Armenians

Come again The imageconscious Armenians sorely feel a missing 
glory in their background Armenians have never achieved statehood 
and independence they have always been subservient and engaged 
in undermining schemes against their rulers They committed 
genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia 
and xSoviet Armenia before and during World War I and fully 
participated in the extermination of the European Jewry 
during World War II Belligerence genocide backstabbing 
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the 
Armenian history To obliterate these episodes the Armenians 
engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims In this zeal 
they tried to cover up the coldblooded genocide of  million 
Turks and Kurds before and during World War I

And the justice is long overdue

As almost all Russian units opposite our front have been withdrawn the
 population loyal to us in regions behind the Russian positions are
 facing an everincreasing threat and suppression as well as cruelties
 and abuses by Armenians who have decided to systematically annihilate
 the Moslem population in regions under their occupation I have 
 regularly informed the Russian Command of these atrocities and
 cruelties and I have gained the impression that the above authority
 seems to be failing in restoring order

th SS Divison made primerily of Bosnian Muslim volunteers did 
quite a job in the former Yugoslavia during WWII  These folks are now 
in their 's's  Makes me wonder how many of them occupy positions

That is the result of watching antiMuslim 'SDPA' Naziscrooksidiots 
too much Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents 
and Nazi Armenian parents Not a chance As early as  K S Papazian 
asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians

        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism'

At that time he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would
actively assume a proGerman stance and even collaborate in World
War II His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim
population of Eastern Anatolia However extreme rightwing ideological
tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before
the outbreak of the Second World War

In  for example O Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted
in the 'Hairenik Weekly' 

The race is force it is treasure If we follow history we shall 
 see that races due to their innate force have created the nations
 and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to
 the race after becoming a nation Today Germany and Italy are
 strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race
 On the other hand Russia is comparatively weak because she is
 bereft of social sanctities

 K S Papazian 'Patriotism Perverted' Boston Baikar Press
    Preface
 'Hairenik Weekly' Friday April   'The Race is our
   Refuge' by O Zarmooni

In April  Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus
A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German
officials in spring and summer  One of them was Souren Begzadian
Paikhar son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku
Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler asking for German support to his
Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the
creation of an Armenian SS formation in order 

to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the 
 spirit of the Nazi ideas

He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories
of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish
homeland Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels
Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian and Frenchlanguage
radio broadcastings The Armenianlanguage broadcastings were
produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored
by General Dro the Butcher He played an important role in the
establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any 
official position His views were represented by his men in the
respective organs An interesting meeting took place between Dro
and ReichsfuehrerSS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 
Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after
a long conversation asked if he could visit POW camp close to
Berlin Himmler provided Dro with his private car 

A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not
'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy
As such they were subject to German racism However Armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged In August 
 Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of
Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs

please don't be offended at this question Who are the Muslims in the
Bosnian context i know that a moslemmuslim is a believer in Islam Islam 
is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world But it is not
 yes definitely not an ethinic group ok so these Bosnian Muslims who
are they to which ethnic group do they belong what languages do they
speak do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats 
the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has 
kept me wondering when the meaning of muslimmoslem i knew from childhood was 
changed in the dictionary this is just a question no flames intended

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH

ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES 
TO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS

As we swooped low over the snowcovered hills of NagornoKarabagh we saw 
the scattered corpses Apparently the refugees had been shot down as 
they ran An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over shown to 
journalists afterwards showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts 
of the hills

The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS  have died in a MASS KILLING 
of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly seized by Armenians 
last week A further  are believed to be wounded frozen to death 
or missing 

Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M attack helicopter 
as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings Suddenly there 
was a thump against the underside of the aircraft a red flash of tracer 
ripped past the starboard wing and the helicopter rocked sharply We 
swung round and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon 
under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire

We had been fired on from an Armenian antiaircraft post We swung round 
again tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a 
valley The brown earth swooped around our heads the helicopter swung 
round again and followed the contours of the ground Our cannon fired 
repeated blasts

Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting 
had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed 
enclave of NagornoKarabakh to pick up some of the dead We had in 
fact been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter 
I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window 
its cannons firing but had thought  mistakenly  that it was on 
our side Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a 
searchandrescue flight that had become a combat mission

Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two 
M Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service nicknamed 
flying crocodiles for their armour Our party was in the second 
crocodile The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains 
and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings The attack helicopters 
were there to give covering fire if necessary

The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet 
armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer An Azerbaijani 
official told us that there were now five former Soviet military 
helicopters and their pilots fighting for Azerbaijan They have 
signed contracts to fly for us he said The helicopter we engaged 
in combat was most probably flown by a brotherofficer of our Russian 
pilot but fighting for the Armenians

We had taken off just before pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield an 
heated for the Armeniancontrolled mountains of Karabakh a sheer 
white wall in the distance The civilian helicopter picked up four 
corpses and it was during this and a previous mission that an 
Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies 
on the hillsides We then took off again in a hurry and speed back 
towards Azerbaijani lines Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before 
the plain  and safety  gazed up at us as we passed

Back at the airfield in Agdam we took a look the bodies the 
civilian helicopter had picked up Two old men a small girl were 
covered with blood their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor 
mortis They had been shot

What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy our close shave 
and the war in NagornoKarabakh He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN POLITELY 
DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER

The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time
 against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been 
 confirmed with very accurate information and the observations made by
 Rawlinson the British representative in Erzurum have confirmed that
 these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians The United States
 delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came 
 to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers hungry and miserable 
 their children and wives their properties destroyed and the delegation
 was a witness to the cruelties Many Muslim villages have been destroyed
 by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns
 before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people When it was hoped
 that this operation would end unfortunately since the beginning of 
 February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region
 of Shuraghel Akpazar Zarshad and Childir have increased According
 to documented information  Muslim villages have been destroyed in the
 aforementioned region more than  people have been slaughtered
 many possessions and livestock have been seized young Muslim women
 have been taken to Kars and Gumru thousands of women and children who
 were able to flee their villages were beaten raped and massacred in the
 mountains and this aggression against the properties lives chastity 
 and honour of the Muslims continued It was the responsibility of the
 Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order 
 to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities 
 committed by the Armenians that the possessions taken from the Muslims
 be returned and that indemnities be paid that the properties lives
 and honour of the Muslims be protected

In those Moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for
 arms by the Armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such
 search and not only had many Moslems been killed but horrible tortures 
 had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where
 valuables had been hidden of which the Armenians were aware of the 
 existence although they had been unable to find them

Actually this strife in Yugoslavia goes back a long way Bosinan Muslims
in collaboration with the Nazis did to Serbians after the first world
war what Serbs are doing to Muslims now This is not a fresh case of
ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga
of intense mutual hatred destruction Not taking sides in this
perpetual war does not amount to religious bigotry It could just
be helplessness with regards to bringing peace to a region that does

Muslims helping the Nazis  Where on earth do you come up with such
accuusation  Do you have proofs  If not you should publically apologize
for such a statement  Last time I heard the nazis prided themselves in
needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies  And if your statment
were true don't you think Israel would of used it to point to what a Muslim
neighbor PALESTINE could do to them if they allowed it to be  The jewish
lobby and power is very strong and if what you said is true we would of
heard it from them before you could come up with it
And you dare say that you are taking no sides

What a dope  There is no value for Mohammed Elabdellaoui to be here

The history of the efforts of the Mufti of Jerusalem to serve the
Nazis in the South Balkans and set up Muslim SS Divisions is
welldocumented  In general Nazism and the leaderprinciple
resonated well among Muslim peoples  Khomeini's concept of the faqih
is a recent example of such resonance  In fact totalitarianism is
etymologically a reasonable translation Islam

To be fair the Mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of
Muslims to join the SS  But the rather small Muslim SS unit did
manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size  There were
also Muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt
of Muslim leaders to entice Muslim people to serve the Nazi cause
actively  And the Turkish government ignored practically all Nazi
overtures even though an alliance with the Nazis against the Soviet
government would have made a great deal of tactical sense

needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies  And if your statment
were true don't you think Israel would of used it to point to what a Muslim

lobby and power is very strong and if what you said is true we would of

about the Jews  What a jerk

Look nobody asked those countries about their UN forces
to be on the ground  They can take their forces which are
incomponent and ineffective at the first place  And let whoever are
willing to do the job what it takes  How anyone can defend this
stinking UN force on the ground who let the Bosnnian PM
yanked out from the UN vehicle and being shot by the Serbian
military  How anyone can defend this UN force who are just watching
the shelling on cities and towns everyday  How anyone can
defend and say those stinking UN forces being effective
when Bosnian had almost  children casualties between  age 
groups  I think talking about the current UN forces to Bosnian
muslims is just an insult to their casualties   

I think Senator Biden said it all what has to be said on this issue
Europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this 
world  Like Biden said they are the bigots when it comes to 
cultural difference and minorty closer to their home
Because they get rid of their minorities long long time
ago starting in th centuries  And they let Adolph
to take care of the rest in th Century  But he was much more 
naughty than they expected because he dared to step many 
toes  So why spoil the good thing now when Serbs doing today what 
they were thinking the same yesterday

C Akgun


Infact on tuesday the Bosnian foreign minister asked formally the UN to leave Bosnia
just to show how much hypocracy is there in Europe These so called UN is actually
helping Serbs carry out their etnicclensingmurdersrapes In Zepa the UN effectively
helped the Serbs carry out their heinous crimes by spreading conflicting reports that
nothing was going on there The cowards or so called UN peacemakers only attempted to 
go out there for a fact finding mission as if with all the hamradio operators were lying
and all the US war planes out there have no means of flying over there This is the biggest
farce in the history of the world and the same act has been repeated over and over again in
different beseiged Bosnian towns

Yes I heard today that the president of Bosnia under pressure from the civilized nations
has appealed to the UN to stay there in Bosnia He should know better

These hypocrates Sadly it includes Clinton administration too all came out and said
that the call for a referendum from bosnian serbian perliment or a bunch of
rapistscriminals is a farce and yet they have to wait for the result of this referendum
to act 

For those of you who are against US to commit ground troops fine just lift the armsembargo on BOTH
sides since we know that serbs always got the heavy weapons form federal army 

Wake up West and admit that you are the most uncivilized the most hypocratic and the most violent
bunch on this earth

I like what Mr Joseph Biden had to say yesterday  in the senate
Condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans 
and calling that moral rape


It is easy for Sen Biden to say that when there are no US troops in
Zepa or Srebinica or Sarejevo

this is true

The existing UN policy may certaining be wrong but the US wants
to dictate policy and make Europe responsible for the consequences
of that policy

this has merit but is not entirely true

Bosnia is a big enough problem for the US to preach about what
other countries should be doing with their forcesbut its forces
are safely tucked away at home in the US

Gerald

this last statement is not true  According to the CBO the United States
has a force of about  US Army personel in Europe I do not know
if this includes a USMC division in Norway  They have available
a little more than  USAF attack aircraft including various models
of the F A FAB  and a few Fs there are about 
more of these available SAFELY TUCKED AWAY AT HOME At one time the
US maintained  MBTs about half were MA but some of these were
relocated to the Persian Gulf  I know the US has at LEAST one 
aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault
brigade  Does anyone know if there are any BBBs in England

The point is although there are no US ground troops in Bosnia
it is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped
outside of St Louis    

I also understand that the administration is planning to position
troops in Macedonia  Any reaction out there to this

Question  day before yesterday I heard that Serbia  Montenegro
had imposed additional trade sanctions against the Bosnian Serb Rebels
This morning a NPR reported at a bridge on the Drina sp verified
that only a bread truck was allowed to pass through to Bosnia
A Serbian who happened to be muslim stated that just a few months
ago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station Now everyone
is stopped and searched many are turned back  Of course all I
heard was a translators version I do not speak SerboCroatian

If this is a effort on the part of Serbia  Montenegro for whatever reason
to push the Boserbs into accepting the VO is this not a good thing

Peace

	CAIRO Egypt UPI  Despite reports and evidence to the contrary a
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wednesday denied knowledge of any measures
taken by Egyptian authorities to restrict telephone contacts with states
linked to Muslim militants

Any state that the CIA does not control is called state that is linked
to terrorismmilitantsfundamentalists etc
Meanwhile Even Egyptian experts who hate The Islamic movement admit
that what is happening in Egypt is spontaneous and most of the time a
reaction to what the government does

	Reports such as one by Israeli Radio and the Iranian official news
agency IRNA said this week Cairo has disconnected telephone lines with
Iran Sudan Pakistan and Afhganistan

	When asked if the telephone communication restrictions represented a
new measure by Egyptian authorities Ibrahim agreed

Can anybody see any contradiction between the above and the first
paragraph 
Does anybody know what the UPI original article's title was

When it comes to Egypt all human rights ethics principles can
be ignored by the western media I wonder why

Macedonia said yesterday it had neither requested or needs such
forces  

This is sort of like sending the National Guard to Bel Air when
the riot is in South Central

Obviously Clinton is again trying to make policy for image purposes
in America rather than to try to deal with the real problem and
assume a share of responsibility for the problem  He obviously
didn't even consult with the Macedonianshe was just looking at
the map of the former Yugoslavia for the safest place to put 
American troops so he could say to the Europeanshey look we
have troops on the ground in the former Yugoslavia toonow let
me bomb so I can make it look like I am doing something in the
American media 

The problem is that the blue berets in Bosnia are dead meat if
Clinton starts bombing but Clinton doesn't have the courage to
ask that the blue berets leave because then he becomes primarily
responsible to the Bosnian policy of the UN and the allies
Clinton wants to have his cake and eat it toohe wants to feel
free to use American military power for the sake of domestic
US politics and his domestic image but he doesn't want to assume
the primary international leadership role in the UN and among
the allies like Bush for all his faults did in the Gulf War
because with leadership comes responsibility and Clinton seems
to want to retain the Europeans as scapegoats

Clinton wants to leave the Europeans in charge and responsible
but wants to freelance on the sideand if his freelancing gets
too hot he wants to be able to cut and runthe American public may
be easily fooledEuropean leaders aren't

Let me remind all of those Muslimhaters out there who like to
mention the Mufti's cooperation with Germany as a reason to let Muslims
be slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts

Why blame the Muslims for what the Nazis did and FORGIVE ITALY THE CROATS
AND MANY OTHER EUROPEANS FOR BEING REAL ALLIES TO HITLER

Why blame Muslims for supporting Germany the enemy of their enemy
at the time Britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible
for most atrocities against Muslims in the region and FORGIVE GERMANY ITSELF
EVENTHOUGH IT IS THE ONE WHO CREATED NAZISM

As far as Muslims are concerned  THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
NAZI GERMANY AND ANTIMUSLIM COLONIALIST BRITAINFRANCE IN  They were
all racist antiarab and full of arrogance and hate WWII and the wars 
in ALgeria Sudan and other places proved that very clearly Even anti
semitism was not more spread in Germany than in France or Britain it just
happened to be official policy in Germany

And we will forgive you just set our countries free

So any arguments about WWII behaviour coming from the people who
killed millions in that war from either side is just plain laughable
Enough said

To All Muslim netters This is the same guy who gave a Fatwah that
Saudi Arabia can be used by the United Ststes to attack Iraq  That
Fatwah is as legitimate as this one With that kind of Clergy it might
be an Islamic duty to separate religion and politics if religion
means official Clergy


  	CAIRO Egypt UPI  The Cairobased Arab Organization for Human
  Rights AOHR Thursday welcomed the establishement last week of the
  Committee for Defense of Legal Rights in Saudi Arabia and said it was
  necessary to have such groups operating in all Arab countries
  	The Londonbased and Saudiowned Al Sharq Al Awsat daily newspaper
  reported Thursday in a dispatch from Riyadh that the Higher Council of
  Ulema Muslim scholars on Wednesday had unanimously proclaimed the
  formation of the group illegitimate and unacceptable
  	In a statement issued in the Saudi capital the council Saudi
  Arabia's highest religious authority said it unanimously proclaims
  illegitimate the creation of this committee and the inadmissibility of
  endorsing it because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is guided by God's
  sharia law and the Islamic courts are widespread nationwide''
  	The statement said no one in the kingdom is prevented from taking
  grievances to those courts or to other concerned authorities and that 
  the authors of the bulletin announcing the founding of the committee
  are well aware of this''
  	The council of  senior clergymen which ended its th session
  Tuesday under chairmanship of Sheikh Abdel Aziz Ben Baz warned that the
  formation of the group will have serious consequences'' but did not
  elaborate

 please don't be offended at this question Who are the Muslims in the
 Bosnian context i know that a moslemmuslim is a believer in Islam Islam 
 is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world But it is not
  yes definitely not an ethinic group ok so these Bosnian Muslims who
 are they to which ethnic group do they belong what languages do they
 speak do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats 
 the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has 
 kept me wondering when the meaning of muslimmoslem i knew from childhood was 
 changed in the dictionary this is just a question no flames intended
 
 oguocha
 

   It is indeed different usage of the word Muslim  In Bosnia  it is more or
less used as an ethnic term not as religious one  There are people in Bosnia
who refer to themselves as Christian Bosnian Muslims if you can make sense
of that  Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims have the same language 
Bosnian Muslims are mainly beleivers of Islam I got this from Bosnian Muslim
friend of mine who goes to University of Texas in Austin

chapter in a  year history of attacks on Jews in Europe  That didn't
make it acceptable and Balkan history does not make the genocide against
Bosnian Muslims acceptable

I guess that it was not acceptable because Germany also chose
a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of
other countries in peril I wonder whether US or other countries
would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and
Hitler had no imperialist ambitions I am no student of history
and I am just asking questions

If even for a moment you think that I am condoing ethnically
motivated violence and killings you are dead wrong Let me
assure I am not My only question is this Do powerful countries
have a moral obligation to interefere in other countries if
their own interests are not threatened I cite an essay by
Charles Krauthammer in the Time this week that discusses
this issue eloquently

For example did US and other European countries abandon their
moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops
to Bombay when Hindus in a rare fit of impassioned rage killed
many Muslims recently I think not

Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries
is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious
accusations of religious bigotry and such

Actually the record of the Allies activities in the face of
incontrovertible evidence as to what the Nazis may they rot in hell
were doing clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done
nothing  The railways to the camps were not bombed despite the ease
of doing so  The US the place of refuge allowed in a bare pittance
of Jews from Europe primarily for public relations so that the
government could say it was doing something  Many ships with
refugees were turned away from US shores some found refuge in Cuba or
South America many others sunk or had to return to Europe with
predictable consequences  The hope today is that we have
collectively learned a lesson and are less complacent to ignore other
countries' internal affairs  The sad reality is that this does not
seem to be the case

It is the Croats that were divided at least  were left in Serbian

  I find it interesting that Mr Major finds the genocide of two
million Muslims in Bosnia acceptable   


Now you are actually claiming that  Muslims have been killed
in BH

Please substantiate this utterly ridiculous claim

No I'm not claiming  have been killed  We are in the middle of
the genocide process that Mr Major has given yet another green light
to  Mladic seems to have most of what he wants but Boban is just
getting his appetite whetted Because Mladic refuses to allow
international observers to inspect massgrave sites and killing centers
in places like Foca Brcko and Visegrad it will be years before we have
an accurate account of the number killed 

In practical terms it would be impossible to kill all   There
just isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and
transportation lines that the Nazis took  YEARS to develop  And
remember the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied  To
actually kill  of the population requires extreme genocidal
organization   

But I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic
annihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture by killing as many as is
feasible by rape by torture by the demolition of mosques libraries
and culture artificts the burning and renaming of villages the shelling
of civilians  So that there won't be any of the  or so Muslims
whose lives have not been shattered by the genocide though they still
may be alive

And Mr Major not only finds this acceptable he helps it along by making
sure that the victims don't have arms to defend themselves

The problem is that the blue berets in Bosnia are dead meat if
Clinton starts bombing but Clinton doesn't have the courage to
ask that the blue berets leave because then he becomes primarily
responsible to the Bosnian policy of the UN and the allies
Clinton wants to have his cake and eat it toohe wants to feel
free to use American military power for the sake of domestic
US politics and his domestic image but he doesn't want to assume
the primary international leadership role in the UN and among
the allies like Bush for all his faults did in the Gulf War
because with leadership comes responsibility and Clinton seems
to want to retain the Europeans as scapegoats


This is one of the most ridiculous arguments I have heard from the 
Europeans Let's let the Serbs massacre rape and ethnically clean
 Bosnians because we don't want our pretty blue berets there
to get scratched  Well I say get them the hell out of there if you're
worried for them but don't deny Bosnians their basic right to self
defense Lift the embargo against Bosnia and let them defend themselves
What makes the UN troops more valuable than the Bosnian people  They
are letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive when
if anything it should be the other way around  Idiots like Owen 
expect Bosnians to swallow a forced plan and just hope this problem
will go away  Well they're wrong  If they had got their butts in gear
that is if Bosnia had oil a year ago much of this could be prevented
Now however the results of this tragedy will last for generations
That's like forcing the jews to make peace with Hitler Yeah right
This as senator Biden said reeks of bigotry and makes me and any 
decent human being for that matter quite sick  It should be the
Europeans not the Americans who take the inititiative and ask the
other for support  This is their backyard not the Americans
Today it's Bosnia tomorrow it will be Kosovo and Macedonia Greece
and then Turkey and the damn thing will spread  Not to mention 
European muslims who weren't even practicing before will rally to
fundamentalism Good luck handling that your majesty  Owen was
upset at the question which compared him to Chamberlain who hoped
to appease Hitler  He said that Chamberlain had been in Munich  years
before any war I have been here during a blazing war for the last
 months  Well that makes him even worse because Chamberlain could
have at least argued I'm giving Germany the benefit of the doubt
whereas Owen can't even do that  What the west is doing is aiding the
Serbs by tying the Bosnians' hands and making the stupid excuse of their
powerless troops on the ground who can't even protect the Bosnian foreign
minister in their own armored vehicle and watch the killers just walk
away  What kind of peace is this  What kind of civilization is this

Clinton wants to leave the Europeans in charge and responsible
but wants to freelance on the sideand if his freelancing gets
too hot he wants to be able to cut and runthe American public may
be easily fooledEuropean leaders aren't

European leaders are PATHETIC and are helping a genocide which even they
will not be able to forget  Yeah they'll go to Africa and fight for some
damn dictator in their former colony they'll go to Kuwait and fight for
oil but in Bosnia not only they won't fight aggression they'll even
tie the hands of the victim  Now you tell me who is fooling whom

You've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide 
Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity They speak SerboCroatian But
there is a ChristoSlavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian
and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by
changing religion  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric
who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls
the people ie Christian slavs  For this reason the warcriminals
call all the Bosnian Muslims Turks even though they are not ethnically
Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language  For this reason
what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically
identical but religiously other is called paradoxically ethnic
cleansing rather than religious cleansing

Thus while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of
WWII and older agenda the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from
Bosnian is being carried out under the cover of the SerboCroat war

please don't be offended at this question Who are the Muslims in the
Bosnian context 

Bosnian Muslims are citizens od BosniaHerzegovina who identify themselves
with Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition

i know that a moslemmuslim is a believer in Islam Islam 
is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world But it is not
 yes definitely not an ethinic group ok so these Bosnian Muslims who
are they to which ethnic group do they belong what languages do they
speak do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats 

In Bosnia Muslim is not merely a religious category but an ethnic
one as well  Actually here are the two contradictory arguments
made by people on this subject

 There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality and Bosnian Muslims
    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith

 Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel
    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs

In  argument  was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid
and  was soundly rejected  The reasons are pragmatic even if
Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under
Turkish rule centuries ago none of the present generation has any
clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality  In fact although
Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national
allegiance most of them feel they have a separate cultural and
historic identity  So arguments like yes but your ancestors were
Croats or Serbs carry very little weight  Regardless of what
their ancestors might have been as long as Bosnian Muslims feel
that they are a separate national group that ends the debate
What outsiders say is simply not relevant

the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has 
kept me wondering when the meaning of muslimmoslem i knew from childhood was 
changed in the dictionary this is just a question no flames intended

In the case of former Yugoslavia the date is  when Muslim nationality
appeared as a census category for the first time  This was the result
of a sequence of decisions over the past decade from recognizing
Bosniaks as an ethnic group  to February  resolution in BH
declaring that Muslims are a separate nation to formal endorsement 
of this in January  and eventually to the  inclusion of
Muslim nationality choice in census forms

For comparison in  census there were three national categories
available to Muslims in BosniaHerzegovina

SerbMuslims                        
CroatMuslims                       
Muslims ethnically undeclared     

This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own
nationality  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat
nationality  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have
consistently opted for a third category in  they chose undeclared
in  they chose Yugoslavs in  both Yugoslavs and Bosniak 
ethnic group and in   and  they chose Muslim nationality

Perhaps the term Bosnian Muslim nationality is too confusing for
the rest of the world  But in the present context we ARE talking
about Muslims as nationality not as a religous group within some
separate national identity  The reasons are mostly historical and
cultural  Religion plays a smaller role as a part of culture in general
because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism  Political
fanaticism yes religious fanaticism no  Group security and survival
dominate people's thinking not fine points of theology  In fact
BosniaHerzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime
as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime

Josip

It is also so easy to blame the West for their indiffernce to

How about them ha  What they are doing to stop this
massacre  Why the oil rich Arab states make the Bosnian crises 
a national interest of the West especially for Europeans  We all

Thus while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of
WWII and older agenda the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from
Bosnian is being carried out under the cover of the SerboCroat war


The annihilation of Islam Turks is an older Serbian agenda   But
I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda
in fact for the past century or two Croats and Muslims have seen
themselves as having a lot in common and they generally had friendly
relations  Your suggestion that CroatMuslim relationship is 
anything like SerbMuslim relationship is completely wrong

To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply
they are not separate peoples  The events of the past two years
clearly show Muslim determination to remain separate in their alliance
with Croats they maintained this separation  Croats would have
accepted a much closer relationship I think  This century plus
of building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at
risk because of the inexorable logic of war  

Since Bosnian Serbs  of population have  times more heavy
weapons than Bosnian Muslims  and Croats  combined they
have squeezed Muslims and Croats into only  of the territory
Muslims lost more territory than Croats who built defenses early on

Under these conditions any alliance is bound to fall apart since
it is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs
The only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of
fortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the
arms embargo  Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading
the Europeans to go along with this this hope was dashed  Having
no prospect of outside help the former allies turned on each other
like two starved animals in a tight cage

This inexorable logic of course got plenty of help from Serbian
intelligence operatives who were doing everything to build
mistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year  A timely
intervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this

Sadly nothing was done to create a balance of power on the
ground  As long as the Serbs enjoy  advantage they can 
break any alliance even among friends  This is tragic but
hardly new divide et impera was used by ancient Romans
with success  In my view Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed
to resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May  
when the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost  

I have a question for the distinguished diplomats do they
believe Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder  I'd like to know
what did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which
solidified Serbian  advantage in heavy weapons how did they expect
to prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces  and how
on Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice

The implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict
but I am filled with foreboding

Sincerely
Josip

am partisan  by definition However this does give me the license to lie 
coverup or revise events under question as we have read on UseNet in postings 
by agents of the Turkish government I understand both sides of the issue but 
this does not mean I will advocate both sides when it suits me Such a 
position would make me a hypocrite I am also not being paid by agents of 
Turkey nor Azerbaijan as are many proponents of the Azeri side I refer to 
agents such as Captioline International Group Ltd being paid in excess of 
month by Azerbaijan I state my case unencumbered by such advocacy or 
prostitution 

A You do not have to change your mind for that  
A just as if you are playing chess ask yourself 
A what if 
A What if your tone is so offensive that one type of
A people loose control and start to erratically insult
A you and others emotionally detach themselves from
A you writings and are not engaging in the discussion 
A with you

My tone is not offensive If people are offended by what I say than I just
may be too bad This conflict as is human conflict in general is rather 
bleak and is surrounded by the most barbaric actions of man Given such 
conditions dispassion is rather difficult and artificial at best This does 
not mean that discussion is out of the question No conflict is ever resolved 
without discussion

A I'll try first Recently I received a message from
A a Russian guy who frequently visited Baku that 
A approximately after  the old situation when 
A there were no antiArmenian press had changed and
A the press became very antiArmenian and average
A Azeri became an Armenianhater This is devastation 
A news for me because one of my cornerstones was the fact
A that I MYSELF SAW ARMENIANS IN BAKU AMONG OTHER ETHNIC
A GROUPS AND SAW OR HEARD OR READ NOTHING THAT WOULD
A SEEM LIKE HATRED You might say that an outsider never 
A sees but by that time I was myself victimized as a member
A of a minority by Russians and knew what to look for and
A what innocent sign or remark might signify

I am sure The Soviet Union effectively froze in time all ethnic problems it
created or was brewing just after WWI During the Soviet reign officials 
tended to shape the frozen conflicts in such a way so when thawed they 
would serve the purposes of the internal policies of the Soviet Union or
successor states

A Again  one of my cornerstones show cracks I will investigate
A Another cornerstone of my thought is that Armenia started
A hostilities against Azeris in Armenia before anything happened
A in Sumgait not at all I am trying to justify violence in Sumgait
A or anywhere else  I bow my head with grief and respect and 
A did demand and will laways demand that criminals be severely
A punished according to the law of the land
A I would like you to supply me with the information about that
A Does or does not the hostilities began in Armenia Was thousands
A od Azeris thrown out of their homes and forced to leave Armeina
A before Sumgait or not 

Sumgait took place in February of  The Azeris of Armenia were expelled
in the late fall of  It took the entire summer of  for the
situation to get so bad for Azeris in Armenian that the Russians had to
evacuate them I refer specifically to Human Rights Violations in Armenia
and Azerbaijan A report of Pax Christi Netherlands  September  Also
one need only read the newspaper to verify this 

You do realize perhaps unknowingly  perhaps not  you are mirroring 
Turkish propaganda and lies regarding what took place when and where first

A Second  in your last message you used a very terrifying
A phrase  Artificial borders when you were talking about 
A Armenian Do you believe that Armenia have righteous territorial
A claims Do you believe that Armenia has rights to the lands that
A currently belong to other countries 
A Do you believe that this is stricktly Armenian priviledge or
A everybody should start reclaiming what once was theirs

I had addressed this issue several time before  perhaps I was not clear The
current borders of Armenia were not set as a result of the consolidation of
a high Armenian culture Today's Armenia is about  the land mass that
sustained Armenians for nearly three millennia It was the natural Armenian
boundaries that sustained Armenians  not the current boundaries The current
borders of Armenia would never support a society nor sustain its growth Does 
this mean that Armenia should expand It might if Armenia is not allowed to 
integrate into the region If this past winter is any indication of the future 
status of Armenia then Armenia must do what it will to survive 
Unfortunately in my opinion and you can quote me on this as I am sure you 
and others will the combined forces of both Armenia and Karabakh should have 
taken Karabakh and the land in between in a matter of weeks in late  This 
would avoided all the pain and suffering both sides endured and would remove a 
tool of Russian influence in the Caucasus You may call me a warmonger  so 
be it If Armenians don't defend their right to live on the land they live on 
those rights will be taken away The Azeris should not have the right to 
remove these Armenians but given the first chance to they will as was 
proven throughout all of Azerbaijan If the Soviet Union didn't break apart 
today Karabakh would be emptied of Armenians Operation Ring started in early 
 emptied the northern  of Karabakh of Armenians but the operation was 
suspended by the disillusionment of the Soviet Union Lucky for the Armenians 
If the Azeris feel as though they can expel all the Armenians of Karabakh the 
Armenians will resist if the Armenians can't live under Azeri oppression 
then they will fight for the right to live their lives free from such 
oppression If this means these Armenian demand independence I support such a 
move If you can't understand this as an Azeri that is truly unfortunate 
Until this is understood by the Gray Wolves in Baku more young Azeri men will 
die in the pursuit of the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Karabakh 
Armenians
 
A Third thing  you keep saying about  years of Armenian presence
A in Karabakh What exactly you mean by that That there were Armenians
A  years ago in Karabah Only Armenians Or among other nations
A I saw SAW a Russian tax map of Karabah with all the landowners and
A occupant names on it the map was surveyed by Russian Army in 
A Would you believe that there were almost exclusivly Achmeds and Hu
A sseins I also saw Armenian names but the absolute majority of the
A population was Muslim If I am wrong  give me your sources but
A please let us keep the rule that we only pay attention to third
A party sources
A There are Russian diplomatic documents about the mission of the
A Russian famous writer and diplomat Griboedov whose mission in Iran
A was protection of Armenians that were persecuted by Persians and
A RELOCATION these Armenians inside Russian Empire According to
A the Russian tax documents that was the time when the population of
A Karabakh became predominantly in some places Armenian

Karabakh or Artsakh as it is known in Armenian and Urartian is the only
piece of Armenia that has a continuous Armenian occupation from the
transformation of the Urartians to Armenians nearly  years ago You
refer to Russian and Muslim rulers over Karabakh not the population You
surely must know the rules of Muslim landownership over nonMuslims

A You write in your letter that Azeris were shelling Stepanakert which
A now is almost completely destroyed  David  is it fair to say that 
A Stepanakert was destroyed by Azeris There is that fine line between
A propaganda and personal view however bizzarre that view is  YOU KNOW
A AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO SAW TV IN THE TIMES OF THE EARTHQUAKE  that 
A Stepanakert was almost completely devastated by the quake 
A But may be you believe that the damage from Azeri shelling is greater
A than the damage from the quake OK no problem AS LONG AS YOU MENTION
A THE QUAKE 

As I wrote in a short response to you regarding this earlier You may be
confusing Spitak with Stepanakert There were no effects of the earthquake 
in Karabakh

If you think I am intellectually dishonest please demonstrate it As I stated
above I am partisan on this issue thus expect me to take a stand in the
interest of the Armenians not against Armenians This stance should not seem 
strange to you I am not here to generate excuses for Armenians wanting to 
live on the land they live on and wanting to live in peace If Armenians must 
die for what they believe in and make ultimate sacrifice you had better 
listen to them No amount of rhetoric  not from Yerevan Baku the CSCE nor

A We can go throwing flames at each other 
A nothing is easier Why do not you just try to
A see the situation from a different prospective

Not taking sides leaves one in a state of perpetual indecision because both 
sides in this issue have their own logic at any given time As an Armenian I 
am partisan  by definition However this does give me the license to lie 
coverup or revise events under question as we have read on UseNet in postings 
by agents of the Turkish government I understand both sides of the issue but 
this does not mean I will advocate both sides when it suits me Such a 
position would make me a hypocrite I am also not being paid by agents of 
Turkey nor Azerbaijan as are many proponents of the Azeri side I refer to 
agents such as Captioline International Group Ltd being paid in excess of 
month by Azerbaijan I state my case unencumbered by such advocacy or 
prostitution 

A You do not have to change your mind for that  
A just as if you are playing chess ask yourself 
A what if 
A What if your tone is so offensive that one type of
A people loose control and start to erratically insult
A you and others emotionally detach themselves from
A you writings and are not engaging in the discussion 
A with you

My tone is not offensive If people are offended by what I say than I just
may be too bad This conflict as is human conflict in general is rather 
bleak and is surrounded by the most barbaric actions of man Given such 
conditions dispassion is rather difficult and artificial at best This does 
not mean that discussion is out of the question No conflict is ever resolved 
without discussion

A I'll try first Recently I received a message from
A a Russian guy who frequently visited Baku that 
A approximately after  the old situation when 
A there were no antiArmenian press had changed and
A the press became very antiArmenian and average
A Azeri became an Armenianhater This is devastation 
A news for me because one of my cornerstones was the fact
A that I MYSELF SAW ARMENIANS IN BAKU AMONG OTHER ETHNIC
A GROUPS AND SAW OR HEARD OR READ NOTHING THAT WOULD
A SEEM LIKE HATRED You might say that an outsider never 
A sees but by that time I was myself victimized as a member
A of a minority by Russians and knew what to look for and
A what innocent sign or remark might signify

I am sure The Soviet Union effectively froze in time all ethnic problems it
created or was brewing just after WWI During the Soviet reign officials 
tended to shape the frozen conflicts in such a way so when thawed they 
would serve the purposes of the internal policies of the Soviet Union or
successor states

A Again  one of my cornerstones show cracks I will investigate
A Another cornerstone of my thought is that Armenia started
A hostilities against Azeris in Armenia before anything happened
A in Sumgait not at all I am trying to justify violence in Sumgait
A or anywhere else  I bow my head with grief and respect and 
A did demand and will laways demand that criminals be severely
A punished according to the law of the land
A I would like you to supply me with the information about that
A Does or does not the hostilities began in Armenia Was thousands
A od Azeris thrown out of their homes and forced to leave Armeina
A before Sumgait or not 

Sumgait took place in February of  The Azeris of Armenia were expelled
in the late fall of  It took the entire summer of  for the
situation to get so bad for Azeris in Armenian that the Russians had to
evacuate them I refer specifically to Human Rights Violations in Armenia
and Azerbaijan A report of Pax Christi Netherlands  September  Also
one need only read the newspaper to verify this 

You do realize perhaps unknowingly  perhaps not  you are mirroring 
Turkish propaganda and lies regarding what took place when and where first

A Second  in your last message you used a very terrifying
A phrase  Artificial borders when you were talking about 
A Armenian Do you believe that Armenia have righteous territorial
A claims Do you believe that Armenia has rights to the lands that
A currently belong to other countries 
A Do you believe that this is stricktly Armenian priviledge or
A everybody should start reclaiming what once was theirs

I had addressed this issue several time before  perhaps I was not clear The
current borders of Armenia were not set as a result of the consolidation of
a high Armenian culture Today's Armenia is about  the land mass that
sustained Armenians for nearly three millennia It was the natural Armenian
boundaries that sustained Armenians  not the current boundaries The current
borders of Armenia would never support a society nor sustain its growth Does 
this mean that Armenia should expand It might if Armenia is not allowed to 
integrate into the region If this past winter is any indication of the future 
status of Armenia then Armenia must do what it will to survive 
Unfortunately in my opinion and you can quote me on this as I am sure you 
and others will the combined forces of both Armenia and Karabakh should have 
taken Karabakh and the land in between in a matter of weeks in late  This 
would avoided all the pain and suffering both sides endured and would remove a 
tool of Russian influence in the Caucasus You may call me a warmonger  so 
be it If Armenians don't defend their right to live on the land they live on 
those rights will be taken away The Azeris should not have the right to 
remove these Armenians but given the first chance to they will as was 
proven throughout all of Azerbaijan If the Soviet Union didn't break apart 
today Karabakh would be emptied of Armenians Operation Ring started in early 
 emptied the northern  of Karabakh of Armenians but the operation was 
suspended by the disillusionment of the Soviet Union Lucky for the Armenians 
If the Azeris feel as though they can expel all the Armenians of Karabakh the 
Armenians will resist if the Armenians can't live under Azeri oppression 
then they will fight for the right to live their lives free from such 
oppression If this means these Armenian demand independence I support such a 
move If you can't understand this as an Azeri that is truly unfortunate 
Until this is understood by the Gray Wolves in Baku more young Azeri men will 
die in the pursuit of the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Karabakh 
Armenians
 
A Third thing  you keep saying about  years of Armenian presence
A in Karabakh What exactly you mean by that That there were Armenians
A  years ago in Karabah Only Armenians Or among other nations
A I saw SAW a Russian tax map of Karabah with all the landowners and
A occupant names on it the map was surveyed by Russian Army in 
A Would you believe that there were almost exclusivly Achmeds and Hu
A sseins I also saw Armenian names but the absolute majority of the
A population was Muslim If I am wrong  give me your sources but
A please let us keep the rule that we only pay attention to third
A party sources
A There are Russian diplomatic documents about the mission of the
A Russian famous writer and diplomat Griboedov whose mission in Iran
A was protection of Armenians that were persecuted by Persians and
A RELOCATION these Armenians inside Russian Empire According to
A the Russian tax documents that was the time when the population of
A Karabakh became predominantly in some places Armenian

Karabakh or Artsakh as it is known in Armenian and Urartian is the only
piece of Armenia that has a continuous Armenian occupation from the
transformation of the Urartians to Armenians nearly  years ago You
refer to Russian and Muslim rulers over Karabakh not the population You
surely must know the rules of Muslim landownership over nonMuslims

A You write in your letter that Azeris were shelling Stepanakert which
A now is almost completely destroyed  David  is it fair to say that 
A Stepanakert was destroyed by Azeris There is that fine line between
A propaganda and personal view however bizzarre that view is  YOU KNOW
A AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO SAW TV IN THE TIMES OF THE EARTHQUAKE  that 
A Stepanakert was almost completely devastated by the quake 
A But may be you believe that the damage from Azeri shelling is greater
A than the damage from the quake OK no problem AS LONG AS YOU MENTION
A THE QUAKE 

As I wrote in a short response to you regarding this earlier You may be
confusing Spitak with Stepanakert There were no effects of the earthquake 
in Karabakh

A I want dialog I am not interested in mudthrowing And in dialog I want
A honest opinions one might be wrong but one MUST be honest Honest 
A opinions may be based on emotions but in this case one should indicate

Fine I stated my opinions and the reasons for them If you put into action 
what you just stated above you would understand my outrage at the posting of

it  yet does not display the courage be responsible for what he posts One 
can always stand behind the facade of claiming what I write is polemic

That Croats and Muslims in Yugoslavia decided to divide themselves does

please don't be offended at this question Who are the Muslims in the
Bosnian context i know that a moslemmuslim is a believer in Islam Islam 
is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world But it is not
 yes definitely not an ethinic group ok so these Bosnian Muslims who
are they to which ethnic group do they belong what languages do they
speak do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats 
the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has 
kept me wondering when the meaning of muslimmoslem i knew from childhood was 
changed in the dictionary this is just a question no flames intended

oguocha


Mr Oguocha
  Muslims in the Bosnian context are in fact Turks In fact correct
  me if I am wrong Serbs are attacking Bosnians with their battle cries
  Death to the Turks 

  Is this so shocking Years of communism apparently suppressed their 
  hatred and anger towards the Turks But such hatred is obviously one that
  dies hard 
  
  Serbs must understand Turks are no longer the good old barbarians world
  has come to know by propaganda after propaganda 
  
  Serbs must further understand that barbarism does not work 
  
  Serbs must even further understand that barbarism would one day have
  to face counterbarbarism So I urge those people Serbs to stop
  killing Bosnian women and children And they must never forget that
  Turks in the motherland are watchingpatiently

You've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide 
Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity They speak SerboCroatian But
there is a ChristoSlavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian
and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by
changing religion  


Muslim in exYugoslavia was a nation not a religion  In fact not
all Muslims in BH are followers of Islam  Therefore there do did
exist in exYugoslavia Christian Muslims  Tito defined the Muslim 
nation constitutionally adding Muslims to Serbs Croats and Slovenes
the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the
end of WWI  In addition Tito added two other nations constitutionally
Montenegrins and Makedonijans 

Nations had the right of secession but republics did not  So Muslim
is much more a political term than a religious term for those who 
differentiate between religion and politics that is in BH  It was not 
a ChristoSlavic ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia it
was the Atheist Communist ideology of Tito  Before Tito there was
no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia  

The war is not a religious war and it is not an ethnic war  It is a
civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
instead of pens  The Croat Muslim and Serb political leaders all
chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements

Don't forget the Davidian Muslims 

Islam is not a race  It's a religion  You can be white black

difficult for you to comprehend given your staunch beliefs in Serbian
ethnic cleansing but give it a try it's really not that difficult

 The war is not a religious war and it is not an ethnic war  

That's right it's a Disneyland war  all a setup for the TV cameras

Terms of secession  You are of course joking right Nick  Nobody
chose to fight  Bosnia and Croatia were internationally
recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their
welldocumented genocide  That makes them an outside aggressor  It's
a simple genocide a classical example of ethnic cleansing  There is

Government troops 'steal women children'


WASHINGTON  Government troops in Sudan are involved in massacres
kidnapping and the transporting of forced labor into Libya according
to a State Department document declassified Wednesday

    The report compiled by the US embassy in Khartoum said government
forces particularly Arab militias organized as the Popular Defense
Forces routinely steal women and children in southern Sudan

    Some women and girls are kept as wives the others are shipped
north where they perform forces labor on Kordofan central Sudan 
farms or are exproted notably to Libya it said

MOSCOW UPI  Five soldiers who served in Russia's th army stationed in

said the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal the 
Russian state news agency Itartass reported 

But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed
over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment 

This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have
committed crimes the statement reads 

The five men together with another soldier who received a year prison
sentence were captured in September  by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar
district of Azerbaijan between NagornoKarabakh and Armenia 

The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a
company of the Russian th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan after which
they were sent across the ArmenianAzeri border into NagornoKarabakh to 
carry out diversions against Azeri troops 

However the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the
Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in
the battle zone round Karabakh 

NagornoKarabakh is an Armenianpopulated enclave within Azerbaijan which for
five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has
left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes 

Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed
in these Caucasian republics who were left behind after the breakup of the 
Soviet Union are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war 

The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the
Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the
six men and to hand them over to the Russian authorities 

It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request 
to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey Itartass said that the soldiers' defense
attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency

    The report below shows that the Sudanese are acting in the finest
traditions of Islamic law as expounded by some diehard people on the 
net who shall remain nameless 

WASHINGTON  Government troops in Sudan are involved in massacres
kidnapping and the transporting of forced labor into Libya according
to a State Department document declassified Wednesday

    The report compiled by the US embassy in Khartoum said government
forces particularly Arab militias organized as the Popular Defense
Forces routinely steal women and children in southern Sudan

    Some women and girls are kept as wives the others are shipped
north where they perform forces labor on Kordofan central Sudan 
farms or are exproted notably to Libya it said

While the people here may be claim to be Muslim the actions reported here

 Muslim in exYugoslavia was a nation not a religion  In fact not
 all Muslims in BH are followers of Islam  Therefore there do did
 exist in exYugoslavia Christian Muslims  

Yeah  That's it   You've really outdone yourself this time Nick
Don't forget the Davidian Muslims 

Islam is not a race  It's a religion  You can be white black
Fijian or Alaskan  I guess you didn't absorb too much of the Malcolm
X interest circulating  You see the whole point of Islam is that it
stresses equality amongst all peoples  Now I do realize this is
difficult for you to comprehend given your staunch beliefs in Serbian
ethnic cleansing but give it a try it's really not that difficult


     Our white knight for Islam rides in again Our instant expert
on religion race and ethnicity is at the door Stand back all Let 
him through He's going to singlehandedly rescue Islam from all these
dastardly mistakes misquotes misconceptions

 The war is not a religious war and it is not an ethnic war  

That's right it's a Disneyland war  all a setup for the TV cameras
There are also people who believe man never landed on the moon that
the whole Apollo story was done in TV studios

 It is a
 civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
 instead of pens  The Croat Muslim and Serb political leaders all
 chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
 peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements 

Terms of secession  You are of course joking right Nick  Nobody
chose to fight  Bosnia and Croatia were internationally
recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their
welldocumented genocide  That makes them an outside aggressor  It's
a simple genocide a classical example of ethnic cleansing  There is
no question of civil war

 Shakil

     Did it occur to you that there is such a thing as Bosnian Serbs
who aren't necessarily outsiders And while you're at it could you
please pontificate a little bit about your Islamic pals in the Sudan
who are running amuck in the South kidnapping women and children
and in essence doing the same thing How come we don't hear your 
wonderful treatises on what's happening

I suppose for the same reason Jews call the Occupied Territory Judea and

My reference is a  page essay in our local Star Tribute newspaper
putting the whole conflict in perspective I will readily admit
that I am no authority in this area however other posteers 
asserted that some Muslims did join hands with Croats and
Nazis in persecuting Serbs In any case past actions do not

And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from
an unnamed source You may indeed be confusing some Muslims 
with Nazi Armenians Altogether  Nazi Armenians served in 
various units in the German Wehrmacht according to Ara J Berkian 
 in predominantly Armenian army units  in German army 
units  in various working units and  in the WaffenSS

A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France
Greece Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit
themselves to the German war effort Derounian says that

Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion 
Armenienne'

That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sided
with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of
Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service

In fall  the Armenian infantry battalions  and  were formed
to be followed by battalions   and  in spring  In the 
second half of  infantry battalions   and  were created
These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were
attached to the infantry division  Also attached to ID  were
the field battalions II I and I which were formed between
May  and May  Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the
Nazi army if battalion II which was not employed at any time is to be
included Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers
Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours

While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the
Second World War Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's
defeat They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces
hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim 
population would be exterminated Stalin played on Armenian national
sentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America
for his imperial ambitions Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish
government led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine

and  was soundly rejected  The reasons are pragmatic even if
Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under
Turkish rule centuries ago none of the present generation has any
clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality  In fact although

I am forced to disagree with you First of all one may have been 
born from a nonTurkish nonMuslim parent outside the Turkish land 
yet still can be a Turk provided this person calls himself or herself 
a Turk Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature
not a racial or religious feature It is a matter of identifying
with the Turkish values Secondly the following observations by 
Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat 

If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the
nations which they brought under their power to which no one could have
opposed today there would be no Eastern problem But Turks did not do so 
They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody to worship in their own
way centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum Thus
in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when 
people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs
differed from theirs the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the
inquisition did not exist where deaths at the stake were unheard of and 
where accusations of witchcraft were not made And the barbarian  Turkey
was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere
by the Christians could find asylum These facts demonstrate that Muslim
countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian
countries

The Turks who are a conquering nation did not Turkify the nations that came
under their rule instead they respected their religions and traditions It
was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of
Russian or Austrian rule Because otherwise there would not have been a
Romanian nation today Popescu Ciocanel

Turks rule over people under their administration only externally without
interfering with their internal structures On account of this the autonomy
of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most
advanced European countries

human beings hate each other on account of religious differences This flaw
is older than Islam and Christianity But there has never been any examples
of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account
of his religion If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of
simple contempt among us too or if it did not keep translating itself into
action many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves
happy A de Mortraye

Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the
inquisition On the contrary it served as an asylum for the unfortunate
victims of Christian fanaticism If you look into history you will see that
in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and
Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been
living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years
and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the
cruelty of Christians especially that of the Orthodoxes No Jew is able to
appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens even today In Turkey
however if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities
local courts immediately take them under their protection

In that vast and calm country of the sultan all religions and nations are
living together peacefully Although the mosque is superior to the church and
the synagogue it does not replace them Because of this the Catholic sect is
more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon In addition 
to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the openair ceremonies of this 
sect neither does any law imprison its cross in the church While the
dead are being taken to the graves a long line of priests bear processional
candles and chant Catholic hymns When all the priests in all the churches in
the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical
processions during the Eucharist celebrations chanting hymns and bearing
their crosses and religious banners a detachment of soldiers escorts them
which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of 
priests A Ubicini

Pardon me History shows that within the last  years Greeks played 
that game twice They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in  to

the Muslim people Again the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V

 pages 

  In  immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the
  Jewish community and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning
  to have an effect in Istanbul local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom
  against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa terminus
  of the Anatolia railroad with three hundred Jews massacred and many more
  beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent
  his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews 

  In later years ritual murder attacks against Jews carried out mostly
  by native Greeks Armenians and in Arab provinces by Maronites and
  other Arab Christians often with the assistance of the local European
  consuls took place throughout the empire There were literally thousands
  of incidents continuously until World War I in Southeastern Europe as far
  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla in Istanbul at Gallipoli and
  the Dardanelles at Salonica and in all the Arab provinces as far south
  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria These
  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians
  by word of mouth or published in their newspapers often by Christian
  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of
  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian
  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia resulting
  in individual and mob attacks on Jews and the burning of their shops
  and homes

  Individual experiences were horrible Jews constantly went in fear of
  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities In Egypt
  and Syria it was usually the Greeks who led the way in many cases
  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians whose
  Greek Arabic and Frenchlanguage newspapers often printed all the
  rumors they could find regarding Jews evidently with the desire of
  instigating violence The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread
  their longstanding antiSemitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt where
  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes
  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule enabled
  them to spread their antiJewish message among the Muslim masses with
  little question or opposition

  On  June  thus Sir Evelyn Baring later Lord Cromer British
  High Commissioner in Egypt received the following report from David
  and Nissim Ades in Cairo

    ''Sir

      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which
      has sic appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which
      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews
      especially those the issues of the th th and th instant
      Now Sir are we to have here an antiSemitic party amidst fanaticism
      Greeks Armenians etc or is he to be allowed to continue to poison
      the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words In an article
      he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover of course
      this has caused a deal of excitement'' 

  Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent
  Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence
  or reduce tension they invariably indicated their cooperation and then
  failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated
  or led them 

  The leader of the Ashkenazi community of Corlu complained to the
  president of AIU Alliance Israelite Universelle in  about
  persistent Greek attacks against its Jewish quarter

The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over  square miles The estimated population
 of the entire region in  was  of whom   percent were
 Armenian   percent Georgian and   percent Moslem
 Of the latter group  were Tatars Paradoxically barely onethird
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds Erevan
 uezd the administrative center of the province had only  Armenians
 as compared to  Moslems By the time of the Russian Census of 
 however the Armenians had established a scant majority  percent in the
 guberniia it had risen by  to  percent or  of the 
 inhabitants This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic a solid block of  Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village 
 Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead

Greeks do not like Turks not because of what they did to us but because of
what they plan to do to us

Let me improve this one for you then For nearly one thousand years 
the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland  the last 
one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation The 
persecutions culminated in  The Armenian Government planned and 
carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects  million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland 
After one thousand years Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks
and Kurds 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye

Today xSoviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by xSoviet Armenia

Today xSoviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity

xSoviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds

Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland

On this occasion we once again reiterate the unquestioned 
justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and

 We demand that the xSoviet Armenian Government admit its 
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide render 
reparations to the Muslim people and return the land to its 
rightful owners The recognition of the Genocide has become an 
issue which cannot be delayed further and it is imperative that 
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed

 We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States 
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide adopts 
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures 
to the contrary

 As taxpayers of the United States we express our vehement 
protest to the present US Government policy of continued 
coddling protection and unqualified assistance towards xSoviet
Armenia

 Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at xSoviet Armenia's

 destruction of  villages

p  fifth paragraph

Yes of course I repeat until this massacre of the Tartars is stopped
 and the three chiefs are not removed from your military leadership I
 hardly think we can supply you arms and ammunition

it is the armed bands led by Dro Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian who
 during the past months have raided and destroyed many Tartar villages in
 the regions of Surmali Etchmiadzin Zangezour and Zangibasar There are
 official charges of massacres

Please cite specific examples where an Arab party member was rejected
while a Jewish party member was accepted

If you look at the bottom of this article you will see that I have very
kindly dug up one of Yigal Arens previous postings entirely without his
permission I hope he doesn't mind containing translations from Ha'arezt
detailing just such a case Perhaps you think that Ha'arezt lies Would
you like to provide me with an assurance that this practise never occurs

If you examine these I am
sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power
base that his Jewish counterpart had

Right Arabs have been voting in Israel for how long And in all that time
NOT ONE Arab EVER gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow
party members to put in a Ministry This is about as likely as sprouting
wings and flying to Rio What basis do you have for explaining this odd
failure You seem very confident that you are right exactly how do you
know why are you sure

Once again if for arguments sake all the Arab Israelis were to vote
for Labor at the next election you can rest assured that the number of
Arab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the
power shift

Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party
has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition
members do the same Why and on what basis are you reassuring me in
the face of  years of discriminatory practise

You are overlooking the fact that they wield political power
as individuals based upon a wider collective power base

Hey what As I said even when their party puts them up they get knocked
back It surely couldn't be because they are Arabs is it

The reasoning I see at work is purely political  As far as security
goes I think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing Jews
as well  eg Sharon

Well yes but Security is the reason most often given by people who
want to make excuses I merely thought it would crop up and so
preempted it

Start of Article All commets in  are mine not Dr Arens

Comments in square brackets are mine  Yigal

From The OTHER Front July    Translation of Ha'aretz article

Racism in the Knesset


Coalition requirements on one hand and the presence of progressive MKs
from Meretz in the coalition on the other have compelled Rabin and
his friends to change to some extent their attitude towards the Arab
public and their representatives in the Knesset  Although he did refuse
to view them as partners taking part in the coalition and joining the
government he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document
of intentions which included a commitment to work towards a decrease in
the discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens  Decrease WHAT
But posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does
not exist at all  Is Rabin too a closet selfhater  Yigal

However racism has not disappeared  When the Knesset sat to consider
who would staff its various committees a request was made to put an MK
from Hadash the Communist party one of the Arab parties  Yigal on
the State Comptroller's Committee  And oh did that ever stir up a
storm  including in the ranks of Labor  since many Knesset members
find it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house
committees  Security secrets are liable to fall into their hands

This attitude  which until recently had not even aroused criticism
being so natural and so deeplyembossed upon people's hearts  holds
that there are Knesset members who despite having been elected by tens
of thousands of votes are not entitled to be full partners in the body
which represents the people of Israel  We are not speaking here of
political discrimination  which would be bad enough in itself  but
of racial discrimination  The proof one of the compromises proposed
was that MK Mahamid an Arab  Yigal should be replaced by Tamar
Gojanski a Jew  Yigal from the same party  It was not the member's
party which was considered unfit but his race

 Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper 

It is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding a
public debate has arisen on this subject as witness the following
article


A TEST OF SELFCONFIDENCE

By Gid'on Levi Ha'aretz July  

Revelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral
part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal
with them  Do you hear that   Please contact this Levi fellow
and explain to him how little he knows about Israel  Please  Yigal
Except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's
window dressing and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious

Last week provided two more such examples the Israeli Knesset is
finding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more
important committees and Israel Television is finding it no less
difficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories  Seemingly
two entirely different matters but in fact they are one and the same

The th Knesset proved last week that even though one third of its
members are new faces it has not renewed its own face at all at least
on one issue  Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and
parliamentary traditions may become obsolete and only one tradition
endures forever no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees
of the house  There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the
External Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee
Worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not to
give Arabs for the first time a place on the State Comptroller's
Committee

The arguments are old and wellknown In all three of the above
committees innumerable secrets are revealed  and woe unto us if an
Arab should hear them  One must not make light of such arguments but
their significance should also not be exaggerated  Every Arab MK is not
spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over
information from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther
headquarters in Jenin and not all the aforementioned committees are
continually occupied in the discussion of topsecret matters which
could safely be revealed for example to MKs supportive of the Jewish
Underground but not to an Arab MK from the Likud Labor or even from
Hadash

The Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee
on Secret Service Matters but what would happen one may ask if MK
Nawaf Masalha were to hear God forbid a review of the Foreign Minister
in an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee or even
a review of the Army Chief of Staff which in any case are regularly
leaked to the next edition of the news  And what would happen if MK
Hashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at
alNajah

Their nonparticipation in important committees and that of their
colleagues creates an intolerable situation where Arab members of the
elected house have only semipositions  They are good enough for
addressing plenary sessions and for voting for or against the
government and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and
Absorption Committee  But they must not for example participate in
the process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or
in the allocation of resources to local authorities  In any case they
have little part in that

Labor's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about
some improvement MK Hashem Mahamid will it seems participate in the
State Comptroller's Committee  Earlier there had been a ridiculous
attempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be
and thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holyofholies
but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional
backing for such a step

But not to worry even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices  The
new Committee Chair Roni Milo has already announced that he will set up
subcommittees aplenty for his committee  Thus he will decide where it
is permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not  A solution
such as this could by the way also have been adopted for the rest of
the committees thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets
being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from
the Knesset

What a dope  There is no value for Mohammed Elabdellaoui to be here

made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately

And is there a reason or value for such a brainless shit for brains asshole
to be haer  You are a self hating bastard  Neither your name nor your
ideas which I've come across before and thought were too stupid and 
uncivlized to respond to prove your firstworldist claim and civility


The history of the efforts of the Mufti of Jerusalem to serve the
Nazis in the South Balkans and set up Muslim SS Divisions is
welldocumented  In general Nazism and the leaderprinciple
resonated well among Muslim peoples  Khomeini's concept of the faqih
is a recent example of such resonance  In fact totalitarianism is
etymologically a reasonable translation Islam

To be fair the Mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of
Muslims to join the SS  But the rather small Muslim SS unit did
manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size  There were
also Muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt
of Muslim leaders to entice Muslim people to serve the Nazi cause
actively  And the Turkish government ignored practically all Nazi
overtures even though an alliance with the Nazis against the Soviet
government would have made a great deal of tactical sense

Give me sources to read it or shut up  You think I will take such an
ignorant as yourself on his words


			Last time I heard the nazis prided themselves in
needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies  And if your statment
were true don't you think Israel would of used it to point to what a Muslim
neighbor PALESTINE could do to them if they allowed it to be  The jewish

Yes the typical primitive Muslim psychopathological psychotic
behavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact  start whining
about the Jews  What a jerk


There is nothing primitive about Islam except in your mind  I do read and
live daily with disagreable facts and I only ask them to prove themselves
The last time I checked this was truly a stworldist civilized approach to
facts and figures  I did not whine about  the jews I merely stated a fact
thet is strange to nobody  As far as me being jerk FUCK YOU  Sorry to
other people that read this

It seems that to keep the peace talks going Israel has to keep
making goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture while Palestinian
Arabs continue to go around hunting Jews

If the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success
the Arabs are going to have to start reciprocating especially since
they are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return
for giving up only intangibles  If they keep trying to change the
already agreed upon rules which seems to be one of their favorite
games the Israelis are not likely to be very confident that the
intangibles they will receive at the bargaining table will be worth
the parchment they're written on

It takes two to negotiate a peace  It's time for the Arabs to start

putting the whole conflict in perspective I will readily admit
that I am no authority in this area however other posteers 
asserted that some Muslims did join hands with Croats and
Nazis in persecuting Serbs In any case past actions do not
in any way validate or legitimize what is happending there now

I sincerely do apologize to the extent the author of the essay

You know that putting something like this out on the newsgroup is only

What is it you feel that Israel has offered as a gesture What would

For those of you who are against US to commit ground troops fine just lift the armsembargo on BOTH
sides since we know that serbs always got the heavy weapons form federal army 

Wake up West and admit that you are the most uncivilized the most hypocratic and the most violent
bunch on this earth

C Akgun Writes

It is also so easy to blame the West for their indiffernce to
real Bosnian suffering  How about the moslem world about  billion
How about them ha  What they are doing to stop this
massacre  Why the oil rich Arab states make the Bosnian crises 
a national interest of the West especially for Europeans  We all 
know they can do it over night don't we Blaming West and asking 
why they don't put their life into danger seems to be the choice of 
muslims too  I think who is sleeping is not the West  They are wide 
awake  They are trying to save the face  


Please read my post carefully I am saying that lift the arms emargo
and let the MUSLIMS defend themselves The point is these Europians 
civilized countries neither want to get intervene militarily themselves
and nor they like to see the muslims of the world to help the oppressed
Remember what happened almost one year ago when the so called UN discovered
some riffles in an Iranian jet in Bosnia The west is not indifferent
in this matter they are siding with Serbs by keeping this embargo on only
muslim side okay onpaper on both sides

responding to a discussion about a mosque in Jerusalem allegedly 
having been destroyed by Israel

BC In today's Jerusalem Post Magazine there is a feature story about the
BC ongoing restoration of synagogues in the Jewish Quarter  The author
BC Leah Abramowitz writes that there were FIFTYSEVEN synagogues in the
BC quarter in  ALL of which were destroyed some she says used as

BC 
BC I still find it really really hard to understand why the demolition
BC of the buildings in front of the Kotel continues to evoke more outrage
BC than this  Everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the Jews
BC 
BC Why
 
    The double standard of human behavior regarding the Jews must
    be manitained

    A perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of
     men who advocated murdering Jews and destroying the State
    of Israel compared to the deafening silence over the abusive
    treatment of Jews in Arab countries during the past  years

    Compare the tacit appoval that the world gives to Muslims who
    randomly murder Jewish civilians to the righteous indignation
    expressed if people in the occupied territories are kept from
    working in Israel in an effort to reduce these random murders
    from occuring while everyone knows that no country is at all
    required to accept foreign workers except Israel of course

    Jewish blood has always been cheap  The nonJewish world ha
    never regarded any form of Jewish suffering important except
    when the Jews were the models of the powerless victim holding
    the high moral ground as it had been just after World War   
    However as soon as the Jewish people started to take care of 
    themselves the ancient hatred of Jews was unleashed again  
    
    I doubt if the nonJewish world is even capable of having any
    compassion towards Jews as antisemitism is so ancient and so
    basic to both Christianity and Islam  
    
    Golda Meir said that there would be peace when the Arabs love
    their own children more than they hate the Jews  And while I
    know that there are more Arab parents who love their children 
    than those who would send their children out into the streets 
    to throw rocks at men trained to defend themselves with guns
    the world is so obsessed by a hatred of Jews trying to defend 
    themselves that they have yet to even question the actions of 
    those parents who not simply allow their children to do this 
    but encourage them to throw themselves into harm's way  Even 
    Arab children are expendable if their tragic deaths are used 
    in the neverending propoganda battle to blame Israel and the  
    Jews for any misfortune befalling Arabs in the middle east



                                                            
   Who is a Jew  A person whose integrity decays when unmoved by
   the knowledge of wrong done to other people    A J Heschel

 Muslim in exYugoslavia was a nation not a religion  In fact not
 all Muslims in BH are followers of Islam  Therefore there do did
 exist in exYugoslavia Christian Muslims  

Yeah  That's it   You've really outdone yourself this time Nick
Don't forget the Davidian Muslims 

Islam is not a race  It's a religion  You can be white black
Fijian or Alaskan 

This does not change the fact that Muslim is a legal and political
term defined constitutionally in former Yugoslavia and therefore has
meaning and consequences entirely independent and immaterial of
any religious considerations
 

 It is a
 civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
 instead of pens  The Croat Muslim and Serb political leaders all
 chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
 peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements 

Terms of secession  You are of course joking right Nick  Nobody
chose to fight  Bosnia and Croatia were internationally
recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their
welldocumented genocide  That makes them an outside aggressor  It's
a simple genocide a classical example of ethnic cleansing  There is
no question of civil war

You only wish it were so

More than  residents of Croatia and BH have not accepted the
terms of secession which Tudjman and Izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon
them  Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but
they do not have a right to grab the entire territories of the former
Yugoslav republics of Croatia and BH

Oh BTW Yugoslavia was internationally recognized when it was 
destroyed by Tudjman Izetbegovic Milosevic and the international
community led by Germany  If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed
against its will then certainly Croatia's borders and BH's borders
can be changed as well  

As I have stated many times the civil war in exYugoslavia will end
when the terms of secession borders etc for Croatia and BH are
finally agreed upon  Serbs Croats and Muslims will all have to
make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement

In article CzrAHnewscisumnedu prabhakgigacsumnedu Satya Prabhakar writes

   I guess that it was not acceptable because Germany also chose
   a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of
   other countries in peril I wonder whether US or other countries
   would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and
   Hitler had no imperialist ambitions I am no student of history
   and I am just asking questions

I don't think they would have  After all the US was one of the
countries that turned away Jewish refugees when there was still time
to get them out  Considered and rejected at the Cabinet level then

   
   Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries
   is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious
   accusations of religious bigotry and such

As I understand it International law provides the right of any
country to intervene to prevent genocide  I think once the World
Court has ruled that genocide is being committed 

If a Human Rights Czar is appointed at the UN we could have
international monitors recording events and responses of local
officials and develop an objective basis  This could be backed by
adjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcement
through a Rapid Deployment Force under the UN Secretary General's
command  I would like to see the UN  directly impose ICJ rulings
whenever feasible without the possibility of vetos at the UN Security
Council much as the President can't veto a US Supreme Court
ruling 
 
The US is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar  the
third world opposition is led by three countries China Iran and
Pakistan What company is Pakistan keeping  

The US is also reconsidering its opposition to the UN force
initially envisaged in the Charter although under the control of the
Security Council  The UN SC is quite a flawed body  Rogue
governments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the last
few months to block the move to place UN troops in Bosnia under
Chapter  instead of  if I have the numbers straight where they
could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force
without requiring further SC action  The PRC even continues to
threaten using its veto on UN action despite the ICJ ruling  The
current setup requires the SC to enforce ICJ rulings

Peace

 Why is it then that when the British Iranians and UAE refer to
 Occupied Territory they mean territory in dispute in Israel but not
 in their own affairs
 
 I suppose for the same reason Jews call the Occupied Territory Judea and
 Sumaria  It's called propaganda 

    Actually Judea and Samaria are proper geographical names just like 
    Asia Minor or Lake Michigan Judea and Samaria are even used in 
    an atlas published in what used to be USSR circa  that I have at
    home The government of the USSR was of course quite hostile towards
    Israel and would hardly engage in a proIsrael propaganda I would be
    willing to mail a photocopy of the relevant page to Mr Schmidling 
    with relevant words underlined to simplify his search if he promises
    to report to the net afterwards
                                   and if you repeat lies often enough
 people start to believe it

Mr Schmidling is to be congtatualted for being living exception to this
general rule For although he is almost without peer in both the number
of lies posted and in the number of times he repeats them  he hasn't 
found many people who believe his lies yet

 If you examine these I am
 sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power
 base that his Jewish counterpart had
 
 Right Arabs have been voting in Israel for how long And in all that time
 NOT ONE Arab EVER gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow
 party members to put in a Ministry This is about as likely as sprouting
 wings and flying to Rio What basis do you have for explaining this odd
 failure You seem very confident that you are right exactly how do you
 know why are you sure

It has nothing to do with how long they have been voting as much as HOW
they have been voting  Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals
for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order  Correlate this
with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections
Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas

Lo and behold you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members
did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of
Arab candidates  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts
between Israeli Arabs  Some claim membership to right wing parties
while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff

I worked within the labor party during the late 's elections not this
last one as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that
were returned from the local delegates elected  At the time the system
was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there
was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps by their own delegates

 Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party
 has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition
 members do the same Why and on what basis are you reassuring me in
 the face of  years of discriminatory practise

Quite simply if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor
party and voted they would be able to command more than  of
the delegates  This is a power base that can not be ignored
Especially when they are not ranked high in the party once again
due to lack of political power  I have seen how the labor party
works from the inside and my experience has been that as in most
political situations the MKs act out of their own selfinterest

And to answer your question I broke with labor because I felt
that they were heeding too much to the rightwing and ultraorthodox
coalition members

 From The OTHER Front July    Translation of Ha'aretz article
 
 Racism in the Knesset
 
 
 This attitude  which until recently had not even aroused criticism
 being so natural and so deeplyembossed upon people's hearts  holds
 that there are Knesset members who despite having been elected by tens
 of thousands of votes are not entitled to be full partners in the body
 which represents the people of Israel  We are not speaking here of
 political discrimination  which would be bad enough in itself  but
 of racial discrimination  The proof one of the compromises proposed
 was that MK Mahamid an Arab  Yigal should be replaced by Tamar
 Gojanski a Jew  Yigal from the same party  It was not the member's
 party which was considered unfit but his race

Fair enough  My take on the matter and I will admit to the possibility
that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument
If he was sitting on the committee then someone else obviously would not
be  In drumming up support for his seat MK  would not be averse to
using this argument or it could be used on his behalf

As to the proof presented in this article I would find it very
interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup
describing how the matter standswas resolved

Let me just take this opportunity to say that I deplore such actions
and groundless justifications

 A TEST OF SELFCONFIDENCE
 
 By Gid'on Levi Ha'aretz July  
 
 But not to worry even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices  The
 new Committee Chair Roni Milo has already announced that he will set up
 subcommittees aplenty for his committee  Thus he will decide where it
 is permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not  A solution
 such as this could by the way also have been adopted for the rest of
 the committees thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets
 being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from
 the Knesset

For the record Roni Milo is a brash MK self described from the Likud
note NOT LABOR  Quite frankly I don't think anything he would say could
surprise me  Annoy and aggravate yes surprise  no

 Do you accept that as documentation

Yes I do and thank you for providing it  I would be most interested
in knowing how things turned out  Anyone

Joachim Martillo writes

What a dope  There is no value for Mohammed Elabdellaoui to be here
at a Western University  Thirdworldist and Islamic brainrot has
made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately


Yes the typical primitive Muslim psychopathological psychotic
behavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact  start whining
about the Jews  What a jerk

You should go back to your mindlessly stupid rd world country  Your
brain has no business in a civilized first world country

Joachim Carlo Santos Martillo Ajami

If you were to substitute the word JewJewish in this posting where you  
see the word MuslimIslamic switch Joachim and Mohammed's names around  
and then repost this you would get a flood of messages attacking the author  
as an antisemite And rightly so The author of this crap is a racist pure  
and simple He obviously has no qualms about being open with it either  
unlike some other Arab and Mulsimbashers on the Net 

Now I for one am not going to look at Joachim's posting and infer from it  
that all Jews think this way Sure there might be some but this view is not  
a part of Judaism and it is stupid to believe that all Jews' minds are this  
twisted However some Muslims might look at Joachim's flame as a  
reaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews that they all hate Arabs and  
are racists

For this reason I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out  
against what Joachim has said They have the chance to possibly change the  
antisemitic views of some people on the net to show them that all Jews do  
not hate all Arabs and Muslims just like all Muslims do not hate all  
Jews Yet they are missing that chance Remember to many people silence  
implies consent

As I have stated many times the civil war in exYugoslavia will end
when the terms of secession borders etc for Croatia and BH are
finally agreed upon  Serbs Croats and Muslims will all have to
make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement  

Muslims already have they accepted the Vance Owen plan that gives
 of the population Serbian statistics put it at  only 
of the territory They gave some totally Muslim villages and areas
to Croatia and Serbia they in effect gave the Serbs the land they grabbed 
while slaughtering the Muslims anbd raping their women and expelling
the survivors

Still the Serbs NOT BOSNIAN SERBS because the real Bosnian Serbs are
fighting with Muslims to defend Bosnia from Serbs those so called 
Bosnian Serbs refused to be part of Bosnia and wanted a greater Serbia
still those Serbs refused they have the necessary weapons to kill
more Muslims and grab more territory

UPI and the newspapers who are reporting this being all owned by Saudis
I wonder how secure they are feeling by reporting all of these things
maybe Saudi Arabia is allowed to have all the human rights violations
it can have nobody is including them in any list those are designed
for independent states

	CAIRO Egypt UPI  The Saudi government ordered the firing and

why is this reported from Cairo

disbarment of six Saudi human rights activists one week after they
formed the country's first human rights group which has been condemned
by the kingdom's highest religious authorities Saudi media reported
Friday
	Two Saudiowned Londonbased daily newspapers reported the dismissal
of five of the activists who last week formed the Committee for the
Protection of Legal Rights in the kingdom to hear allegations of human
rights abuses
	The newspapers said orders were issued to dismiss Abdallah alJabreen
from his job with the Iftaa Department Saudi Arabia's highest religious
advisory body Hamad alSeleifeh from the Eduaction Ministry and
Mohamed alMuss'eri Abdallah alHamed and Abdallah alTuwaijri from two
universities in Riyadh the Saudi capital
	Licenses to practice as law attorneys were also ordered revoked for
Suleiman alMarshoudi and alMuss'eri and their law offices and any
national branches were ordered closed for the same reason

	Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Ben Abdel Aziz a member of the
royal family rejected criticism of human rights violations in the
kingdom
	In an interview broadcast Friday he said nations and organizations
 say they protect human rights or demand respect of human rights''
but at the same time refuse to intervene in BosniaHerzegovina where
people are being killed raped and destroyed while even barred from
carrying arms''
	Where is the humanity and human rights of which those are talking''
the prince said in the interview broadcast by the Saudiowned London
based Middle East Broadcasting Center

Can somebody teach this man some logic
what is the relationship between a human rights league in  Saudia
and human rights in Bosnia I guess if we wanted to know what is
in Italy we should know what is in Brasil Syrian Joke

	Prince Nayef who controls Saudi police and prisons said the
kingdom's enforcement of Islamic laws gives his country one of the

their claim of following Islamic law is the biggest disservice
that they ever did to Islam


	But Hosni Amin executive director of the Cairobased Arab
Organization for Human Rights said his group has documented evidence of
human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia He said the AOHR supported the

But how about human rights in Egypt Mr Amin

I guess I am fighting on too many fronts I might retire very soon

Yea I think not also Israel's  issue is Security so any outcomes
of negotiation certainly need to address ISREAL'S perception of this
issue

The problem is is defining by outsiders by Israel and by the Arabs
themselves what is the  issue to the Arab side Is it Palestinian
statehood is it that Israel as a state should not and must not be
allowed to exist is it that the existence of a selfgoverning non
muslim state in the Islamic World is intolerablewhat Just as
the dividing line between Israelfightingforsecurity and Israelfighting
toexpand is often hard to discern by outsiders especially to the Arab 
world so the rationale behind the ArabstruggletoundermineIsraelin
anyway could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of being
wronged that still values peace who knows which 

Anyway in these talks what gestures would you think would be seen
by Israel as substantial

In article CtxJunixamherstedu eerginelunixamherstedu ERDEM
ERGINEL asked

EE No no flaming here Just a simple question

with a simple answer

EE As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox
EE faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire It is
EE also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism
EE and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period 

The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian
Apostolic There was however a higher percentage of nonGregorian Armenians 
in Cilicia closer to the Mediterranean in Adana Marash Aintab etc  

EE Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia
EE did not speak any Armenian but used Turkish in their everyday lives

This is not true While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in
certain areas of Cilician Armenia most all Armenians spoke Armenian In fact
Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian For sure most all
Armenians especially men also knew Turkish in order to function in larger 
society

EE My question is given so many separations in the Armenian community what
EE was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian
EE nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century As I stated religion
EE was not uniform unlike the Greeks and many Armenians couldn't even speak
EE Armenian I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the
EE Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian 
EE consciousness

The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian regardless
of the specific branch of Christianity they professed The resultant Armenian
nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution Even at the later 
stages of WWI and after the genocide many Armenians who were converted to 
Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems This 
practice continued well into the s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy 
of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism Many of these
converted Armenians ironically in order to stay alive were staunch Moslems 

EE Any information will be appreciated

You answered your own question The common thread throughout your inquiry
was the word Armenian

EE Regards

I like what Mr Joseph Biden had to say yesterday  in the senate

Condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans 
and calling that moral rape

He went on to say that the reason for that is out right religious BIGOTRY

Actually this strife in Yugoslavia goes back a long way Bosinan Muslims
in collaboration with the Nazis did to Serbians after the first world
war what Serbs are doing to Muslims now This is not a fresh case of
ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga
of intense mutual hatred destruction Not taking sides in this
perpetual war does not amount to religious bigotry It could just
be helplessness with regards to bringing peace to a region that does
not even know the meaning of the word

   
     What a lie

     Ask the victims of the Nazis
     Don't take the Bosnian muslims' word for it
     Ask the Holoucost survivors who helped them you will hear that
     the Bosnian muslims among others helped them

     I also do object to the term ethnic cleansing since what is happening
     in Bosnia is not ethnic cleansing they all have the same ethnicity
     what is different is religion they are Orthodox christians Catholic 
     christians and Muslims

     It's religious cleansing

     Also watching people being rounded up and slaughtered by the slitting of 
     the throat raped collectively and systematically driven out of their
     homes by the millions  tortured in concentration camps maimed
     and  does indeed amount to moral rape

     Nothing in the history justifies what's happening

	First of all this is NOT a strife this is a massacre of innocent
	Moslem poeples by the Christian West

	Since Ottoman lost the control of Balkans many tens and hundereds
	of millions of Muslem peoples Turks Albanians Bosnians and others 
	have been tortured raped massacred and driven out of their homes
	by the Cristians of both the region and Europe Some lucky ones 
	escaped to relative safety in Turkiye The remaining others are being 
	finished now by local Christians the USA and the rest of Europe

	The Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslem
	peoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting 
	Christian Serbs and Croats torture rape and massacre the innocent 
	Moslem peoples of Bosnia

	It took Christian Europe for almost six centuries to achieve this
	objective of theirs and I do not think they will let it up This will 
	go on untill every single Moslem person Bosnian Turk Albanian etc
	is tortured raped massacred and driven out of their homes

There are treaties signed between Greece and Turkey which speak about a 
Moslem minority in Thraki and not of a Turkish minority in Thraki
The reason they talk about Moslems and not about Turks is that the majority
of these people are not ethnik Turks They are Pomaks and Gypsies

Oboy this is exciting First you discuss your nonexistent literature
tastes then your fantasies and now your choices of historical revisionism
Are you related to 'Arromdians' of the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and
Revisionism Triangle

The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks' 
which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference 
to 'Muslims' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the 
existence of a few thousand nonTurkish Muslims does not change the 
essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger 
Turkish minority The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people whom all the 
three nations Bulgarians Turks and Greeks consider as part of 
themselves Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized 
according to the agreements 

It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece 
and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world
The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish
minority They pursue the same denial in connection with 
the Macedonians of Greece Talk about oppression In addition
in  the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No 
virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and
other charitable trusts They have ceased to be selfsupporting
religious and cultural entities Talk about fascism The Greek 
governments are attempting to appoint the muftus irrespective
of the will of the Turkish minority as state official Although
the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in
Greece the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing
its religious leaders Talk about democracy

The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic 
convention in Komotini Such destruction which reflects an 
attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage is a 
violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'socalled' 
Greek Constitution which is supposed to guarantee the protection 
of historical monuments 

The government of Greece on the other hand is building new 
churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward 
Hellenizing the region

The longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles
and on signboards is prohibited The Greek courts have
ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association 
the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti 
Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks
in Western Thrace Such community associations had been 
active until  But they were first told to remove
the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official
papers and then eventually close down This is also the 
final verdict November   of the Greek High Court

Helsinki Watch a wellknown Human Rights group had been investigating 
the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece In August  their 
findings were published in a report titled 

 'Destroying Ethnic Identity Turks of Greece'

The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the 
Turkish minority by the Greek authorities It says for instance 
the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in 
Komotini Such destruction which reflects an attitude against 
the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the 
Lausanne Convention 



HELSINKI WATCH PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE

Ankara AA  In a page report  of the Helsinki Watch  it is
stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced
with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being
implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government
should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of
minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and
in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the Turkish
Minority in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify
themselves as 'Turks'

GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS

The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek
state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish
minority with Turkey

Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is
called Greek  by ethnic  definition only  the religion  of the
minority in  Western Thrace is  considered In an  interview with
the Greek  newspaper Ethnos he said  I am a Greek  citizen of
Turkish origin The individuals of the minority living in Western
Trace are also Turkish

Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in
Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement
signed in  Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey
in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace

Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr
SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority
Faikoglu said  In fact we  helped Greece Because  we prevented
Greece the cradle of democracy from losing face before European
countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal
rights

On TurcoGreek relations he pointed  out that both countries are
predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical
reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign
powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by

MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE

Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in
Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state according to a
Court Summons No  obtained by MILS

  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  or Anastasios  Bulis
have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in
an Athenian magazine

  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly
magazine  ENA  on  March      and  said  that  they  as
Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would
field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the upcoming  Greek
general election

  Bulev said in the interview I am not Greek I am Macedonian
Sideropoulos said  in the  article that Greece  should recognise
Macedonia  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations
against  Greece are  tales We  are in  a panic  to secure  the
border at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC
are falling

  The  main  charge  against  the two  according  to  the  court
summons  was   that  they  have   spreadintentionally  false
information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the
citizens  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the
international interests of the country Greece

  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a
Macedonian ethnicity There are believed to be between  to
  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece  largely
concentrated in the north It is  a crime against the Greek state
if anyone declares themselves Macedonian

  In    Greece   SerbiaYugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned
Macedonia into three  pieces In  Albania  took  Macedonian
villages The part under  SerboYugoslav occupation broke away in
  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia  There are  
million Macedonians in the Republic  in Bulgaria 
in Albania and  in Serbia proper

  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian
human rights in  Greece and lost his job as  a forestry worker a
few years ago  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in
the mediteranean Only pressure from Amnesty International forced
the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of
Florina Lerin in Northern  Greece Aegean Macedonia where the
majority of ethnic Macedonians live

  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in
which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent
especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its
northern neighbour the Republic of Macedonia

  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned
Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks who
largely live in Western Thrace But it remains to be seen if the
US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections
are over

It seems that terrorism against their own conationals has been a prominent
 part of the revolutionary activities of the Dashnag leaders of the Caucasus
 Organized to fight the Turks these chieftains have been more successful
 in their fight against their Armenian opponents in Turkey and the Caucasus
 very often defenseless and innocent

We were defeated

p 

The fact remains however that the leaders of the Turkish Armenian section
 of the Dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the
 Turkish cause when the Turks entered the warand a call was sent for 
 Armenian volunteers to fight the Turks on the Caucasian front

p 

Thousands of Armenians from all over the world flocked to the standards of
 such famous fighters as Antranik Kery Dro etc The Armenian volunteer
 regiments rendered valuable service to the Russian Army in the years of
 


By the way here is the entire paragraph

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village 
 Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead

My reference is a  page essay in our local Star Tribute newspaper
putting the whole conflict in perspective I will readily admit
that I am no authority in this area however other posteers 
asserted that some Muslims did join hands with Croats and
Nazis in persecuting Serbs In any case past actions do not

And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from
an unnamed source You may indeed be confusing some Muslims 
with Nazi Armenians Altogether  Nazi Armenians served in 
various units in the German Wehrmacht according to Ara J Berkian

My question is given so many separations in the Armenian community what
was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian
nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century As I stated religion

There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians
The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina'
or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument
The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun
cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb  BC

  The monarch Dara said I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya'

  On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'

  To the country town of Zozo to Armaniya 'Armeniya'

According to Karakashian

As for 'Armenia' the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians
this is more recent than the word 'Ararat' and is to be found used in
the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'  

Saint Martin

The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all
the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians
as 'Haiastan' It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs
as Ermeniyye
 
Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap'
which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia' 'Ar' refers to a
place as in Ararat Archish Aruyr Archar Arshav Arazen and Aror 
while 'men' is used to refer to spirit thought or human being and 
therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'

G Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary Haik
is the diminutive form of Hai and that Hai is the name of our
nation Our nation is in no way connected with the word Armen that
foreigners apply to our people'

It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a placename that 'Armen' is 
the name of the people who lived there and that these are in no way
connected with the word 'Hai'

Haik and Haiastan

Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom
the Armenian people took the name 'Hai' But the mere resemblance
between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof and
in any case no such theory appears before the time of Moses of
Khoren

Haiasa

The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were
no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the 
region known as Armenia

Professor Hachadurian 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite
inscriptions for Upper Armenia'

Yensen in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is
identical with the Hittite 'Hatio' in other words that 'Hai' is a
Hittite word Research however has proved this erroneous and shown
that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'

Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with 
no success As for Greek there is no point in even mentioning it

The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious
that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'

Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai' 'Haikazan' and
'Haiastan' entered our older works

According to Karakashian 

'The word Haik is never to be found employed with reference to a
leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren nor is it
ever found employed in the forms Haika or Haykazn

Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a placename he
improved and developed Haiastan etc If the word had referred
to a nation and had been derived from Hai or Haik they could 
also have used the words Haikak and Haykazn in a number of
places'

According to Professor Sayce who deciphered a number of Hittite 
inscriptions

'In the Hittite language the suffix ha is used to specify quality
or species The words Haddanas Haddina were used by the 
Assyrians to refer to the Hittites With the transformation of the
d between the two a letters to y Hadinasdani was in this
way transformed to Haiastan'

Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view but regards
the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'
and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory He finds however that a 
solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' 
which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from  BC onwards
Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia In that case
it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia The
suffix dan is of Anatolian origin The real root is 'Hayasa' which
refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'

E Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological 
and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people

The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows Almost
all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic very dark
above average height an Aissores Asian group with close ties
with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples

According to J Deniker

From the philological point of view the Armenian and Kurds may be
regarded as belonging to the Iranian groupThe Armenians are 
descended from various elements and from a very mixed race Their
average height varies between  and  according to the region
They are almost always shortheaded with skull measurements of 
 As a race they belong to the IndoAfghanAssyrianTurkic
family

Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows

The Armenians are a mixture of Semites Turk Kurds and Mongols
but some of them display Armenian features eg height a little
above average fair complexion dark hair dark eyes very often
a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth 

Investigations carried out by N Kossovitch on the links between
Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics
led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a 
distinct race

                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union All humanitarian constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter Universal Declaration of Human
Rights Helsinki Agreements Human Problems International Forums
documents signed by the Soviet Union  all of them are violated

The USSR's President government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace

The  strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan As a result a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed hundreds of people killed thousands wounded

Some  Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR their historical homeland
Together with them  Russians and  Kurds have also
been driven out a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan
Some  TurkishMeskhetians Lezghins and representatives 
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection 
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance
for the honour and dignity of  million Azerbaijanis are
violated its territory culture  and history are trampled
its people are shot There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad and this defamation is spread over 
the whole world by Soviet mass media Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States 

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent 
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR

We are for a united indivisible sovereign Azerbaijan we 
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in  by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic  Muhammed Emin Rasulzade

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '
Year Reich'  the 'Great Armenia'  by annexing the 
neighboring lands

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent

But what about the lives of seven million human beings
If these people are Muslims does it mean that they are
less valuable Can people be discriminated by their 
colour of skin or religion by their residence or other
attributes

All people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion Our previous
appeals were unheard However we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins

PAINFUL SEARCH 

THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians
in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan  about
 men  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
fouryear war over Nagorny Karabakh

The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators  Hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the Baku press Diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates

The   February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of
the last moves  in their fouryear campaign to  take full control
of Nagorny Karabakh  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
in Rome on Monday The bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and  a massacre but  investigators say that most  of the
dead were civilians The awful  number of people killed was first
suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku
Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  griefstricken
Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 
dead

The State Prosecuter Aydin Rasulov  the cheif investigator of a
man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  Hojali
Disaster said  his figure of   people dead was a  minimum on
preliminary  findings  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman
Memmedov the mayor of Hojali An  even higher one was printed in
the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May   dead  people named and more
than  bodies reported unidentified  This figure of nearly 
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova the new spokeswoman
of the Azeri Ministry of Defence

FranCois Zen  Ruffinen head  of delegation of  the International
Red Cross  in Baku said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
Agdam had reported a figure of   bodies received at his mosque
from  Hojali most  of  them  civilians We  did  not count  the
bodies But  the figure seems  reasonable It is no  fantasy Mr
Zen Ruffinen said We have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead

Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
number of  dead in the  massacre Don't  get worked up  It will
take  several months  to  get a  final  figure the  yearold
lawyer said at his small office

Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things It  took him two  years to
reach  a firm  conclusion that    people were  killed and  
wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
uprising in Baku in January 

Those  nationalists the  Popular  Front finally  came to  power
three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
what  happened when  Hojali an  Azeri town  which lies  about 
miles from the border with Armenia fell to the Armenians

Officially  people have so  far been certified as dead being
the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
republic's forensic department This  is just a small percentage
of the dead said Rafiq Youssifov the republic's chief forensic
scientist They were the only bodies brought to us Remember the
chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within  hours

Of these  people  were women and  were children under 
years old  Gunshots killed   people  shrapnel killed   and
axes or  blunt instruments  killed   Exposure in  the highland
snows killed the last three  Thirtythree people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation including ears  noses breasts or penises
cut off and  eyes gouged out according  to Professor Youssifov's
report Those  bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed Mr Rasulov said

Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
disorganised   lists of   Azeri militiamen are dead  here six
policemen there  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant the
names of   corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day The
most heartbreaking account from   witnesses interviewed so far
comes  from Towfiq  Manafov  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a
helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  
February

There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly   in Hojali  people  by the stream
and the road and   visible around Nakhchivanik village Mr
Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
pilot

People waved up  to us for help We saw  three dead children and
one  twoyearold alive  by  one  dead woman  The  live one  was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up We tried to land but
Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
return

There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali
at the time  many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by Armenian forces

HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES

AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafebar on  the
Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in
his trousers torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of
Hojali just over three months ago writes Hugh Pope

I'm still  wearing the same  clothes I don't have  any others
the  yearold carpenter  said  beginning his  account of  the
Hojali disaster I was wounded in five places but I am lucky to
be alive

Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food without electricity
for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for 
days They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the
 to   people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the
edge of Karabakh

At about pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard
before  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons  artillery  heavy
machineguns the lot Mr Sadikov said

Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction
of  the  attack Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started
fleeing the town  down a hill through a stream  and through the
snow into a forest on the other side

To escape the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam
about   miles away They  thought they  were going to  make it
until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two
Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak

None of my group was hurt up to then  Then we were spotted by
a  car on  the road  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening
fire Mr Sadikov said

Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward
to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians but  their efforts
were mostly  in vain  Mr Sadikov  said only   people  from his
group of   made it  through including his wife  and militiaman
son  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died  including  his
yearold elder brother

I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat
he said pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes We
have never got any of the bodies back

The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire
One hero  of the  evacuation Alif  Hajief was  shot dead  as he
struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's
crossing Mr Sadikov said

Another hero  Elman Memmedov the  mayor of Hojali said  he and
several others  spent the whole day  of  February in  the bushy
hillside surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three
Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay

As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam  there was
little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was
soon to flee

The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian
rocket attack Some people just  kept going Mr Sadikov said I
had to  get to the  hospital for treatment I  was in a  bad way
They even found a bullet in my sock

Victims of  war An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son killed  in the
Hojali massacre in February  left Nurses struggle in primitive
conditions  centre  to  save  a  wounded  man  in  a  makeshift
operating  theatre set  up  in a  train carriage  Griefstricken
relatives in  the town of Agdam  right weep over the  coffin of
another of the massacre victims Calculating the final death toll
has been  complicated because Muslims  bury their dead  within 
hours

    A perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of
     men who advocated murdering Jews and destroying the State
    of Israel compared to the deafening silence over the abusive
    treatment of Jews in Arab countries during the past  years

Never mind the fact that these people were denied the right to a fair trial  

Repeat a lie often enough and people will start to believe it eh

The Hamas terrorists were given the opportunity to appeal  They've
chosen not to obviously because they get better propaganda mileage
out of refusing

Israel also agreed that they could return immediately provided they
agreed to stop killing Jews  Their refusal speaks for itself

In September  our medical reserve unit was sent to the KETZIOT
prison camp to take care of Arab prisoner who were housed in 
sections of  prisoners each with each section subdivided in
 units housing  prisoners The prisoners would communicate
with other distant sections sometimes  yards away by
taking stones tying written notes to the stones and throwing
them with incredible precision to other sections I should have

In article benalialcor benalialcorconcordiaca  ILYESS B BDIRA  writes
It looks like Ben Baz's mind and heart are also blind not only his eyes
I used to respect him today I lost the minimal amount of respect that
I struggled to keep for him
To All Muslim netters This is the same guy who gave a Fatwah that
Saudi Arabia can be used by the United Ststes to attack Iraq  

They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait
a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties
to Saudi citizens  And me thinks if the US had not helped out
the Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia too or at 
least the eastern oilfields  And no Muslim country was doing
much of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi
Arabia indeed in some masses of citizens were demonstrating
in favor of that butcher Saddam who killed lotsa Muslims
just because he was killing raping and looting relatively
rich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West

So how would have you defended Saudi Arabia and rolled
back the Iraqi invasion were you in charge of Saudi Arabia

Fatwah is as legitimate as this one With that kind of Clergy it might
be an Islamic duty to separate religion and politics if religion
means official Clergy

I think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an
official religion de facto or de jure because with human nature
like it is the ambitious and not the pious will always be the
ones who rise to power  There are just too many people in this
world or any country for the citizens to really know if a 
leader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator


  	CAIRO Egypt UPI  The Cairobased Arab Organization for Human
  Rights AOHR Thursday welcomed the establishement last week of the
  Committee for Defense of Legal Rights in Saudi Arabia and said it was
  necessary to have such groups operating in all Arab countries

You make it sound like these guys are angels Ilyess  In your
clarinet posting you edited out some stuff was it the following
Friday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is
more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers who
think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively
enough  The NYT reported that besides complaining that the
government was not conservative enough they have

	 asserted that the approx  Shiites in the Kingdom
	  are apostates a charge that under Saudi and Islamic law
	  brings the death penalty  

	  Diplomatic guy Sheikh bin Jibrin isn't he Ilyess

	 called for severe punishment of the  or so women who
	  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on
	  women driving  The guy from the group who said this
	  Abdelhamoud alToweijri said that these women should
	  be fired from their jobs jailed and branded as
	  prostitutes

	  Is this what you want to see happen Ilyess  I've
	  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving
	  has no basis in the Qur'an the ahadith etc
	  Yet these folks not only like the ban they want
	  these women falsely called prostitutes  

	  If I were you I'd choose my heroes wisely
	  Ilyess not just reflexively rally behind
	  anyone who hates anyone you hate

	 say that women should not be allowed to work

	 say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom

Now the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government
on earth I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot among
other things  I just think that the most likely replacements
for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country
But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately  In the
last six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing
by the muttawain religious policenot government of Western women
not fully veiled something stupid for women to do IMO because it
sends the wrong signals about your morality  And I've read that
they've cracked down on the few homebased expartiate religious
gatherings and even posted rewards in governmentowned newspapers
offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who
dare worship in their homes or any other secret place So the
government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of
the wind out of the sails of the moreconservative opposition
As unislamic as some of these things are they're just a small
taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of
Saud like they're trying to in the long run

Is this really what you and Rached and others in the general
westisevilzionistsrulehatewestoryouareapuppet crowd

I always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history
are condemned to repeat it Will Durant  but I am beginning to
believe the opposite is true

Here in tpm and in other newsgroups it seems that history is
mainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club In the
history of my own people there are ample acts of shame both done
by my people and done to my people Since I was not party to any
of those acts I refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my
ancestors committed nor do I direct hatred toward the descendants
of those who committed evil acts against my ancestors

Will all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque Will it rebuild
the Temple Somehow I doubt that it will

A post in another group on the Bosnian war asked us all to love
each other that love would conquer hate Sadly I remember a TV
interview with a young woman in Sarajevo sp who was as I remember
a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot She was now
trying to pickoff Serbian snipers During the communist years she
had married a Serb who was now fighting against her people So it
seems that hate will conquer love

Is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try
and see how we might all live together It's a damn small planet
which we have come very close to turning into a radioactive ball
glowing softly in space We seem to have been spared that prospect
shall we now bathe it in each other's blood

Shalom Salam and Peace

 linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical 
enterprise

 Get your union to actively support the right of 
Palestinian teachers in the Occupied Territories to form 
unions

a through the International Labor Organization if your 
union is a member
b contacting other international unions which have 
supported our right to form a union  we can supply 
names and addresses

 Establish a SCHOLARSHIP FUND for one or more 
Palestinian students to study at a Palestinian university 
or school  or establish a scholarship fund for a 
Palestinian student or teacher to study at a university 
abroad

Rabin's plans for a Palestinian police

from The Other Front Alternative Information Center
Jerusalem  May 

The decision to view the setting up of a local police force 
for sic the Palestinians as the central issue for 
deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week  
even before subjects like elections in the territories and 
areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy  is a 
sign of the Israeli government's serious attitude towards 
the peace process

The setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture 
package' but deals with the very heart and substance of 
the Palestinian struggle for national identity As it turns 
out the main objective guiding the prime minister in the 
setting up of a Palestinian police force  and apparently 
also supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres  is to 
ensure the holding of democratic elections in the 
territories

Thus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial Israeli daily 
Hadashot  April and his position articulates the 
thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this 
issue in the past two weeks Over against them stand the 
settlers and rightwing parties who also interpret the 
decision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian 
police force as a significant step towards the instituting of 
real autonomy something which will restrict what can be 
done by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip With a variety of demonstrations including street 
theater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian 
police force' rightwing elements are attempting to 
frighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go 
back on his decision Members of the Kach movement 
have even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the 
Occupied Territories as counterbalance to the future 
Palestinian police force

However as Barzilai points out the main function of the 
new police force  as far as the Israeli government is 
concerned  has nothing to do with the settlers over 
whom they will apparently have no authority but will 
control political groups within the Palestinian population 
whom the government is interested in neutralizing 
Writes Barzilai

According to ideas currently taking shape the setting 
up of a local police force in the territories will precede 
not only the stage of electsion but also the final stages of 
the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement

The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a 
local Palestinian police force is evidence that the 
government is serious about arriving at a settlement with 
the Palestinians

It's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly 
worried about this new Israeli initiative And it is 
inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal 
Husseini and the rest of the delegation members from a 
variety of directions to refuse the gift which Rabin would 
like to give them But at this stage it looks like the 
Palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his 
plans


Add'l comment by ED
Numerous Palestinians fear that Israel might succeed in 
coopting some Palestinian
circles by this idea They fear that a Palestinian police 
force controlled in fact by Israel might act even more 
brutally than the IDF The idea of using a surrogate police 
force is not new It is used by Israel in Lebanon and was 
used by the Nazis to control Jewish ghettodwellers

REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIA

LORD OWEN AND THE SERBS

In early February ' Lord Owen made appearances in New York City
on the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows On a couple of occasions on
those shows Lord Owen gave away his proSerbian position when he
made the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in
dispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled
and occupied by Serbs before WWII  It was as if he were saying
that since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and
lost them during the Hitler years they should be allowed to
reconquer them today

I was familiar with this view because my father a Yugoslav Jew
who escaped to this country during the war was aided and found
sympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years  In recent
months when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned my
father would make the point that  Serbs were killed by Nazi
and proNazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha  My father is
so proSerbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities My
father also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis
because my father said Anthony Lewis is always talking about
the Muslims

UpdateApril   After an uneasy truce in and around
Sbernica shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and
the killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton
administration dithers its response  In the days leading to the
collapse of resistance at Sbernica Lord Owen changed his tune
Previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds
that it would endanger UN relief workers When Serbian forces
began to march on Sbernica the threat to UN relief soldiers
went unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention
to stop Serbian aggression including the use of air strikes  The
current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West
and a failure of the VanceOwen initiative which did nothing to
halt the Serbs Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that
Lord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state Lord Owen belatedly
calls for strong action

CLINTON AND BOSNIA

In the summer of  George Kenney a senior State Department
official the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk made
news when he resigned from the State Department because of the
Bush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian
aggression  As Kenney saw it Bush's inaction was largely due to
the president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by
getting involved there

Apparently the same is true of the Clinton administration
Clinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did
about the terrible ongoing tragedy but the practical effect has
so far been the same

According to the New York Times  the Clinton
administration did everything it could to suppress a midMarch
report by its own experts which called for military action if
necessary to protect safe havens for the Muslims At one point
Senate majority leader George Mitchell was so incensed that the
report was kept from Congress that he called for an
investigation

Instead of helping the desperate Bosnians Clinton has signalled
again and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what
they want in Bosniaindeed Clinton and the West have been
signalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish
off the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other
way  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would
NOT send in American military forces on the ground  On this
issue Clinton has made me wistful for Bush  Bush and Baker could
not have done worse and might have been pressured to do better
well before this time  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and
the destruction might have been curtailed

The Nation the left and the Bosnian QUANDARY

Typical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core
issue involved in Bosnia ie a clear aggressor destroying
hundreds of thousands of lives is the editorial on the Bosnian
quandary in The Nation   In the end the editorial votes
to do nothing even while noticing the ghastly atrocities of the
Bosnian Serbs  and that the greater and lesser powersdither
and fuss and hang back Before anything else happens the
Clinton Administration ought to pay the  million the United
States owes the UN the editorial concludes

In its most striking passage the editorial writer warns that
those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side
of the Bosnians had better review US foreign policy since World
War II  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the
Bosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of US clients
including the Chileans the South Africans the Greek fascists and
others In a subsequent column for The Nation Christopher
Hitchens correctly called this editorial contemptible



William Pfaff a European based journalist who writes for the The
New Yorker and the Los Angeles Times is among a group of liberal
columnists like Anthony Lewis and Leslie Gelb who have clearly
and consistently called for strong Western and American
intervention to stop the Serbs  Pfaff's most recent column
Liberal Opinion Week  is entitled International
Cowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy

He clarifies the international failure which has led to present
situation in one sentence Having refused to intervene to
sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent
Croatia in June  or to block or penalize the military
aggression by Serbia that immediately followed and the atrocious
ethnic cleansing which followed that the United Nations now
contemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which
two years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since
experienced  He goes on to explain that UN plans now envisaged
call for a more daunting and openended military assignment than
a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have
been a year ago

Aryeh Neier on the Serbs In his Watching Rights column in the
The Nation  Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the
motivation of the aggressorsthe preferred term for the Serbian
forces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than
a year  He explains that there is no  military purpose that is
served by the destruction of its fabric and its peopleAbove
all few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would
want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt  They are
not city people

It is this I believeaside from a desire to break the morale of
Bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at
any pricethat explains the conduct of the siege of
SarajevoIt is a loathing for all that is urban pluralist and
cosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation

Historically most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and
Herzegovina has been rural while Muslims who were the civil
servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule
made up a disproportionate share of the urban populationThe
destruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility
against this city it is also an attack on the urban ideaThe
demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war
exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred
for all that is cosmopolitan

The light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is
at stake  The Serbs represent the knownothing antisecularist
fundamentalist fascist forces who are attacking the urban
cosmopolitan secular multicultural idea  They are attacking
the rest of us just as Hitler did One irony is that at the
beginning of the crisis over Bosnia it was for awhile maintained
by the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a
threat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state

Neier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to
secularism multiculturalism diversity and democracy  It's the
Serbs who are attacking the democratic notion the democratic
idea

Anthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does
respect for Clinton's presidency dependon his acting
effectively against Serbian aggressionFirst of all because to
do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values
we and our allies profess  Times  But it's not merely
a betrayal of our values  It's because the Serbs are attacking us
by proxy just as Hitler was

One argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a
different form is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for
Europe  We hear it as the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians
that is to say just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been
the key to instability in the Middle East just so will the
hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities
result in turmoil in Europe for decades to come

One of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though
the Atlantic Ocean divides us the Americas are ultimately tied to
the destiny of Europe If Europe is destabilized the US will
inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems  As in a
whirlpool  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom
And as past history and Pfaff have shown it's much better if we
do so decisively quickly and on our terms

Sincerely Ronald Bleier

armies in  History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey Volume

London Cambridge University Press  pp 

In April  Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van whose  Armenians comprised  percent of the population 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the EmpireLeaving Erivan 
 on April   Armenian volunteers reached Van on May  and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days

Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories Armenian political leaders army officers and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves

With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in  at the beginning of
 World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies

Meanwhile Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final
 plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans with the 
 president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response

 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
  glorious Russian Army with their blood to serve the victory of Russian
  armsLet the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the
  Bosporus Let with Your will great Majesty the peoples remaining
  under the Turkish yoke receive freedom Let the Armenian people of Turkey
  who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new
  free life under the protection of Russia'

Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies Preparations were made
to strike the Ottomans from the rear and the czar returned to St Petersburg
confident that the day finally had come for him to reach Istanbul

 Horizon Tiflis November   quoted by Hovannisian Road to
Independence p  FO   

Ottoman morale and military position in the east were seriously hurt and
 the way was prepared for a new Russian push into eastern Anatolia to be
 accompanied by an open Armenian revolt against the sultan

An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection and it 
 appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away it might be
 able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian
 civilization An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from
 the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
 Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet' Thousands of Armenians from
 Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new 
 Armenian stateBy midJuly there were as many as  Armenians
 crowded into the Van area which before the crisis had housed and fed
 no more than  people Muslim and nonMuslim alike

As you point out above the original quote used the term Tartars''
as distinct from Turks'' but you perhaps feel free to make these
minor adjustments in the name of truth

I went through this just a few weeks ago here it comes again The 
entire Turkish population of Armenia which Armenians called Tartars 
constituted at least about  of the total population of Armenia 
was deliberately exterminated For the population statistics please 
look to the book of Richard Hovannessian Armenia on the Road to 
Independence I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime 
by the writings of one Armenian one American and one British They 
are Men Are Like That by Leonard R Hartill Adventures in the Near 
East by A Rawlinson World Alive A Personal Story by Robert Dunn 
Also I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings 
of two Armenians and also one American The official British report about 
this massacre mentioned in one of these documents Lord CurzonAharonin 
interview is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia 
Sir Oliver Wardrop


An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the
 systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of 
 the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at 
 least  percent of the population of that republic The 
 memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and 
 eyewitnessed these atrocities was published in the US in
  with the title 'Men Are Like That' Other references abound

xSoviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of  million 
Turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide 
You and those like you will not get away with the genocide's coverup

During the First World War and the ensuing years   
the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide 
tried to complete its centuriesold policy of annihilation against 
the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering  million Muslims and 
deporting the rest from their  year homeland

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the th Century acted upon an entire people

Since all the Moslems capable of bearing arms were in the Turkish Army
 it was easy to organize a terrible massacre by the Armenians against

 Russians but were attacking the Moslem folk in the region as well

Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of  
 million Muslim people

Foreword

For example we were camped one night in a halfruined Tartar mosque 
 the most habitable building of a destroyed village near the border 
 of Persia and Russian Armenia During the course of evening I asked 
 Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and 
 the cause of its destruction In his matter of fact way he replied Yes 
 I assisted in its sack and destruction and witnessed the slaying of 
 those whose bones you saw today scattered among its ruins 

p  first and second paragraphs

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village 
 Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead 

p  second paragraph

The Tartars were for the most part poor Some of them lived in villages 
 and cultivated small farms many of them continued in the way of life of 
 their nomadic forefathers They drove their flocks and herds from valley 
 to valley from plain to mountain and from mountain to plain following 
 the pasturage as it changed with the seasons They ranged from the salt 
 desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains 
 Even the village Tartars are a primitive people only semicivilized

I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars and while 
 holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country regarded and
 treated them as inferiors The fact that the Russians looked down upon all
 Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars far from proving
 a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors intensified
 an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility

p  second paragraph

Our men armed themselves gathered together and advanced on the Tartar
 section of the village There were no lights in the houses and the doors
 were barred for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great 
 fear Our men hammered on the doors but got no response whereupon they
 smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last
 Tartar was slain Throughout the hideous night I cowered at home in terror
 unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and
 the loud shouts of our men By morning the work was finished

p  second paragraph

As things were the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative
 experience consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself
 incompetent to rule by legitimate means

 The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and
 outside the law When they became a legally instituted recognized governing
 body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands they proved incompetent to 
 do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their 
 fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days

 The outstanding feature of their rule now that they were in power was
 as in the old days trial and execution without hearing A man evoking
 the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and
 condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him The method 
 of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the
 condemned man in his home or on the street place a pistol to the back
 of his head and blow out his brains This simple way of getting rid of
 those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became
 a common way of paying debts

p  first paragraph

A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar I saw the
 point of the weapon emerge through his back Another soldier seized a rock 
 and pounded the Tartar's head with it The Armenian who had bayoneted him
 sprang to his feet wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body and raising
 it to his lips licked it clean of blood exclaiming in Russian 'Slodkey
 Slodkey' Sweet

p  second paragraph

One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village Among the 
 ruins a fire was burning I went to the fire and saw seated about
 it a group of soldiers Among them were two Tartar girls mere children
 The girls were crouched on the ground crying softly with suppressed
 sobs Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and
 other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes There were also bodies of the
 dead

p  first paragraph

I was soon asleep In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of
 a child I arose and went to investigate A full moon enabled me to make
 my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy
 that had been enacted Guided by the child's crying I entered the yard of
 a house which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a
 Turkish family There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead Her
 throat had been cut Lying on her breast was a small child a girl about a
 year old

p 

Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow the cart
 jolting and the loads swaying Boys ran along the line of oxen encouraging
 them with shrill Tartar cries and belaboring the beasts with sticks In the
 carts the women veiled as is the Tartar way held children in their arms
 Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they
 sought protection from the wind and cold A few old men plodded along on foot

 Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown The leading
 oxteam reached this barrier and halted The gunmen and other ruffians 
 concealed among the rocks opened fire Women and children leaped and
 scrambled from the carts screamed ran and sought vainly for safety

 This massacre was not complete The Armenian soldiers in the nearby 
 barracks hearing the firing and the turmoil hurried to the scene
 That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted
 and completely destroyed

p 

Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hidingplaces on the
 retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced They entered
 into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores
 that had been left by the Turks

p 

Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars Kurds and Turks Their villages
 were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country

p 

The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order
 of diminishing intensity Tartars Kurds and Russians 

p  First and second paragraphs

Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villagesWe Armenians 
 did not spare the TartarsIf persisted in the slaughtering of prisoners 
 the looting and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace 
 actions expected and accepted as a matter of course

 I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground
 in numbers like the fallen leaves in a forest They had been as helpless
 and as defenseless as sheep They had not died as soldiers die in the
 heat of battle fired with ardor and courage with weapons in their hands
 and exchanging blow for blow They had died as the helpless must with
 their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself

p  first paragraph

In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who
 had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians
 abandoned the struggle During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of
 these poor devils were cruelly put to death I was sickened by the
 brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest Some
 mercifully were shot Many of them were burned to death The method
 employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after
 crowding the hut with Turks set fire to the straw

p  first paragraph

The Tartar section of the town no longer existed except as a pile of
 ruins It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered The same 
 fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi

p  second paragraph

Many of our men had served in the Russian Army and were trained soldiers
 We Armenians were rich and possessed arms Tartars had never received
 military training They were poor and possessed few arms beyond knives
 Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village the revolution
 in Russia was suppressed

p  third paragraph

Within a few years following the beginning of the movement an invisible
 government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish 
 Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government This secret 
 government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called
 'Mauserists' professional killers to enforce its decrees

p  first paragraph

The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish 
 Government

p  third paragraph

the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish
 Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene
 and secure independence for Turkish Armenia

p  second paragraph

The Dashnacks were fanatics           

p  third paragraph

The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their 
 revolutionary activities into the Russian province They instituted 
 a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing
 contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians A wealthy
 man would be assessed a stipulated sum Refusal to pay brought upon
 him a sentence of death 

 Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without 
 question If a man were to be assassinated lots might be drawn to
 select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the
 'mauserists' of the party

p  first paragraph

in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars they 
 Armenians have been remorseless in seeking vengeance

p  third paragraph

The city was a scene of confusion and terror During the early days of 
 the war when the Russian troops invaded Turkey large numbers of the 
 Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian 
 advance

p  second paragraph

I made a cannon a huge gun to lift which required four men I made balls
 for it With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar
 houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out

p  first paragraph

The Tartar villages were in ruins

p  third paragraph

The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood his 
 beard still setaceous and now crimsoned

The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek 
Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will 
remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece someday whatever 
the cost to the parties involved The history speaks for itself Greece 
was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent
its troops on July   in an attempt to topple the legitimate
government of Archibishop Makarios

The release of Nikos Sampson a member of EOKA National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters and a convicted terrorist shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece Of
course the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences 
for this irresponsible conduct

             THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM

 Irfan Bey Street Kumsal Area Nicosia Cyprus

It is the  house of Dr Nihat  Ilhan a major who  was serving at
the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent During  the attacks launched
against the Turks by the Greeks on th December  Dr Nihat
Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally
killed in the  bathroom where they had tried to  hide by savage
Greeks Dr  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night the
th   December     Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities
committed during and after  are exhibited in this house which
has been converted into a museum

AN EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY
GREEK TERRORISTS

The date  is the th of  December  The onslaught  of the
Greeks against the Turks which  started three days ago has been
going on  with all its  ferocity and defenseless women  old men
and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks And now Kumsal
Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage
bloodshed

The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr Nihat  Ilhan a
major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent
are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the
bathroom of their house by  maddened Greeks who broke into their
home A glaring example of Greek barbarism

Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by
Mr Hasan  Yusuf Gudum an  eye witness who himself  was wounded
during the same terrible event

On the night of the th  of December  my wife Feride Hasan
and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr Nihat Ilhan
Our neighbours  Mrs Ayshe of  Mora her daughter Ishin  and Mrs
Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us  We were  all sitting
having supper  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River
direction started to riddle the  house sounding like heavy rain
Thinking  that   the  diningroom  where  we   were  sitting  was
dangerous we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought
would be  safer Altogether we were  nine persons We all  hid in
the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet We
waited in fear Mrs Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor was standing
in the bath with her three children Murat Kutsi and Hakan in her
arms Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open
Greeks had  come in and were  combing every corner of  the house
with  their machine  gun bullets  During these  moments I  heard
voices saying in  Greek You want Taksim eh  and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom Mrs Ilhan and her three children
fell into  the bath They were  shot At this moment  the Greeks
who broke  into the bathroom emptied  their guns on us  again I
heard one of the Major's children moan then I fainted

When I came  to myself  or   hours later I saw  Mrs Ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the  bath I and the rest of the
neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded But what
had happened to my wife Then I remembered and immediately ran to
the  toilet where  in  the doorway  I saw  her  body She  was
brutally murdered

In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying
Help help Is  there no one to save us  I became terrified I
thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not
dead they would kill  me So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself
under the doublebed

An our  passed by In the  distance I could still  hear shots My
mouth was dry  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some
water Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the
bathroom which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago There I
offered sweets  to Mrs Ayshe  her daughter and Mrs  Novber who
were all wounded

We  waited in  the bathroom  until   o'clock in  the morning  I
thought morning would never come  We were all wounded and needed
to be taken  to hospital Finally as we could  walk Mrs Novber
and I went  out into the street hoping to  find help and walked
as far as Koshklu Chiftlik

There we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were
operated on When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there
were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs
Ayshe and her daughter

After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to
Ankara  for  further treatment  There  I  have had  four  months
treatment but still I cannot use  my arm On my return to Cyprus
Greeks arrested me at the Airport

All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my
detention They then released me

ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER

We went tonight into the sealedoff Turkish quarter of Nicosia in
which   to  people have  been slaughtered in the  last five
days

We  were the  first  Western  reporters there  and  we saw  some
terrible sights

In the Kumsal quarter at No  Irfan Bey Sokagi we made our way
into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass  A
child's bicycle lay in a corner

In the  bathroom looking  like a group  of waxworks  were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother

In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the
head

This we  were told was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence

Today was five days later and still they lay there

Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE From the DAILY EXPRESS

I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant
children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer

AR Western readers have learned of the Nagorno Upper Karabakh
AR controversy through reports from that remote area by Western
AR correspondents and from commentaries by member of the longestablished
AR ArmenianAmerican community  Azeri views on this dispute have
AR appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media  Therefore let me
AR present Washington Report readers with some basic truths about the
AR origins of the conflict

During the past two years if one reads all the commentaries on the subject
a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri

The following should be interesting 

AR Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and
AR expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic  Actually
AR the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian
AR Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 
AR when  Azeris were driven out of Armenia  Following that move
AR there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait
ARin February  and two years later in Baku in January 

This not true Other than simply checking the newspapers I will quote from an
independent human rights report In the PAX Cristi Netherlands  September
 page  we read

 By midnovember many incidents took place in several places in
  Azerbaijan The APF Azeri Popular Front challenged the Communist Party
  for power  After ten days the authorities came in with tanks to
  reimpose their power In Nakhitchevan the last Armenian villages were
  deported In Ganja Armenians were attacked and killed All  
  Armenian inhabitants fled the city

  Between  November and  December  refugees from Ganja arrived in
  Armenia while all  Azeris in Armenia were chased away

In this part of the world February  start of organized antiArmenian 
pogroms in Azerbaijan come before November and December of 

AR Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that
AR both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule
AR in the Transcaucasus according to the Roman principle of divide and
AR rule  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the fiveyear
AR history of the conflict

It is interesting that the Azeris killed burnt raped the Armenians but the
perpetrators blame Russians and Armenians themselves on other occasions
 
AR Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement in
AR Zheleznovodsk Moscow Tehran Rome Geneva and AlmaAta an
AR invisible hand provoked further bloodshed  Those interested in
AR maintaining the AzeriArmenian conflict as well as the Georgian
AR turmoil are imperialist forces in Russia and probably in Iran

Incorrect When were the people of NagornoKarabakh ever involved in an
agreement Never Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno
Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict
 
AR The Armenian offensive last spring created more than  new Azeri
AR refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and
AR adjacent rural districts  Today  Azeri refugees throng the
AR city of Baku and environs providing more problems for the newly
AR elected Popular Front government which is opposed by the rigidly
AR nationalistic National Independence Party
 
It's called war If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the 
Armenians of NagornoKarabakh to live in their ways keep their Armenian
culture these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence The
Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and
play dead 

AR How can a Westernstyle democracy survive in a small Muslim country
AR where  million of the  million inhabitants are unemployed  In the
AR absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees as Kurdish
AR and Bosnian refugees have been helped how can the Azeri government
AR reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands homes and
AR possessions

The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they
attempted to deprive Armenians of lands homes and possessions
 
AR Such simple realities must be understood in the West
AR Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian
AR public opinion to imagine a permanent and therefore irreversible
AR ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus

True and you Dr Alec Rasizade should practice what you preach
 
AR I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea
AR Meanwhile continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western
AR states into the conflict through activation of various security
AR alliances  These include on the Armenian side the Moscowled
AR Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact signed
AR May    On the Azeri side should Turkey get involved as the
AR guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct
AR   these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces

Western interference Turkish intervention The moment Turkey dares step into
this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of 
Europe as if it ever will and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia
Dr Rasizade international realpolitik is not as simpleminded as you would
have us believe
 
AR Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an
ARArmenian enclave within Azerbaijan  The truth is that the Armenians
AR began to appear there only in the middle of the last century

Incorrect once again A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish
claim 

Armenians today refer to the area of NagornoKarabakh as Artsakh which 
comes from the Urartian term UrtekheUrtekhini NO Azeris yet 

Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as Orkhistena NO Azeris yet

In the first half of the th century BC Artsakh as part of Ervandid
Armenia of Media NO Azeris yet

From the end of the th century BC Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom
of Ervan NO Azeris yet

Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran Orkhistena or 
Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo as part of Armenia NO Azeris yet

After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in  
AD until  Artsakh was part of Armenia NO Azeris yet

End of the th century Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the 
Aranshakhiks NO Azeris yet

By the th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed NO Azeris yet

Emperor Konstantin  addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen To
Armenia Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh NO Azeris yet

In the decree of Paul I  the number of Armenian families in this area
was stated as 

It was from the th to the th centuries that nonArmenians from Central
Asia Asia Minor and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence
in the planes of Artsakh Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh

In  Karabagh becomes part of Russia Officiallt part of Russia  Some 
Muslims in Karabakh

In  the number of Armenian churches in NagornoKarabagh was  
priests  parishioners in  Armenian towns and villages The Armenian
percentage of the population was over  MAX  Azeris in Karabakh 
assuming no Kurds

Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December  

 The WorkerPeasant Government of Azerbaidzan having been informed of the
  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic sends its greetings
  to the brother people From this day the previous boundaries between
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled Nagornyi Karabakh Zangezur and
  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis
  Republic

  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan

				Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan
							N Narimanov

				People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs
							Guseinov

AR A few years ago they celebrated the th anniversary of their
AR resettlement from Persia to Karabakh after it came under Russian
AR rule 

No incorrect The  celebration was the th anniversary of Russian rule
in the Caucasus including Karabakh

AR At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew
AR in Russian and German settlers who were welcomed by Azeris  How
AR would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in
AR southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland and
AR demanded separation from California

Nonsequitur 
 
AR Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement
AR Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians  That is correct

Armenian historians don't say this

AR The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the
AR fourth century  But those ancient residents had no link to and
AR nothing in common with Armenians

Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith and
their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy makes such an 
argument totally invalid

AR Azeris would have a better claim to
AR be successors of Albania since Azeris have for centuries inhabited
AR dominated and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation

Wishing to be part of a people nonexistent for nearly a millennium for geo
political advantage is rather outrageous In addition to such absurdity
Azeris claim to be Turks Persians and all the while are Azerizing their
minorities such as the Lezgians Kurds Tat Talish and a host of other
nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan

AR Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the
AR Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of  and the
AR Paris Charter for New Europe of  confirming their mutual
AR adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders  This
AR principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the
AR Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory
AR nations not just by Turkey

Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to depopulate Karabakh of
Armenians
 
AR This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the UN the
AR CSCE the Commonwealth NATO or Iran  The second key to untying the
AR Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor according to the
AR UN definition of 

Fine so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian
enclave What is Azerbaijan afraid of Perhaps the fact that the territory
is the home of Armenians the UN would by definition support the local
population 
 
AR When that is accomplished the international community can and should
AR apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as
AR those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the
AR former Yugoslavia  Such decisive collective international action can
AR halt further aggression in Karabakh and prevent the ArmenianAzeri
AR conflict from growing and spreading
 
Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their
own future the is issue not viewing isolating events out of context are 
actions that will address the Karabakh conflict Viewing events in a war
in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as
an act of Allied aggression

Here is a press release from the White House

 Text of President Clinton's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets
 To National Desk
 Contact White House Press Office 

   WASHINGTON May    Following is a letter
President Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets

  TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES

       I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the
  last Presidential report on November   concerning the
  national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in
  Executive Order No  of November   and matters
  relating to Executive Order No  of October  
  This report is submitted pursuant to section c of the
  International Emergency Economic Powers Act  USC c
  and section c of the International Security and Development
  Cooperation Act of   USC aac  This report
  covers events through March    The last report dated
  November   covered events through October  

         There have been no amendments to the Iranian
  Transactions Regulations ITRs  CFR Part  or to the
  Iranian Assets Control Regulations IACRs  CFR Part 
  since the last report

         The Office of Foreign Assets Control FAC of the
  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications
  for import licenses under the ITRs  However as previously
  reported recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a
  substantial decrease in the number of applications received
  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranianorigin goods

       During the reporting period the Customs Service has
  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranianorigin
  merchandise primarily carpets for violation of the import
  prohibitions of the ITRs  FAC and Customs Service investi
  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions
  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties  Additional
  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review

         The IranUnited States Claims Tribunal the
  Tribunal established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers
  Accords continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims
  before it  Since the last report the Tribunal has rendered
   awards for a total of  awards  Of that total  have
  been awards in favor of American claimants   of these were
  awards on agreed terms authorizing and approving payment of
  settlements negotiated by the parties and  were decisions
  adjudicated on the merits  The Tribunal has issued  decisions
  dismissing claims on the merits and  decisions dismissing
  claims for jurisdictional reasons  Of the  remaining awards
   approved the withdrawal of cases and  were in favor of
  Iranian claimants  As of March   awards to successful
  American claimants from the Security Account held by the
  NV Settlement Bank stood at 

       As of March   the Security Account has fallen
  below the required balance of  million  times  Iran has
  periodically replenished the account as required by the Algiers
  Accords by transferring funds from the separate account held by
  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account

         The Tribunal continues to make progress in the
  arbitration of claims of US nationals for  or more
  Since the last report nine large claims have been decided
  More than  percent of the nonbank claims have now been
  disposed of through adjudication settlement or voluntary
  withdrawal leaving  such claims on the docket  The larger
  claims the resolution of which has been slowed by their
  complexity are finally being resolved sometimes with sizable
  awards to the US claimants  For example two claimants were
  awarded more than  million each by the Tribunal in October

 Come again The imageconscious Armenians sorely feel a missing 
 glory in their background Armenians have never achieved statehood 
 and independence they have always been subservient and engaged 
 in undermining schemes against their rulers They committed 
 genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia 
 and xSoviet Armenia before and during World War I and fully 
 participated in the extermination of the European Jewry 
 during World War II Belligerence genocide backstabbing 
 rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the 
 Armenian history To obliterate these episodes the Armenians 
 engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims In this zeal 
 they tried to cover up the coldblooded genocide of  million 
 Turks and Kurds before and during World War I

Your note was not on target at all  Armenians have had MANY independent 
times in their long and beautiful history Including an independent 

Your ignorance is hardly characteristic of most 'ians' Sarkis Atamian 
explains in his book called 'The Armenian Community New York  
Philosophical Library' that according to historians original fatherland 
of the Armenians was in Thessaly Greece Armenian invaders burned and 
sacked the fatherland of Urartus massacred and exterminated its population 
and presented to the world all those left from the Urartus as the Armenian 
civilization All reliable western historians describe how Armenians 
ruthlessly exterminated  million Muslim women children and elderly 
people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of 
the Muslim people between  It is unfortunately a truth that 
Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II 
and that even today criminal members of the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism 
Triangle preach and instigate racism hatred violence and terrorism 
among peoples 

Please tell me how on earth Armenians fully participated in the genocide 
of Jews during WWII are you on some heavy drugs  

Who says 'Arromdians' are no damn good During World War II Armenians 
were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over 
the Nazis In that zeal the Armenian publication in Germany Hairenik 
carried statements as follows

Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements the Jews
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease and when it 
 becomes necessary for a people the Nazis to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method these attempts are regarded as revolutionary During the surgical
 operation the flow of blood is a natural thing 

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews 
extracts from a letter dated December   published in the San
Francisco Chronicle as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B Amarian

 We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people Jews Members of our family witnessed the 
  murder of  members of our family near Erzurum Turkey by Armenian 
  neighbors bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish 
  andor Muslim Armenians should look to their own history and see 
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war on his premise 
  to grant themselves government if in return the Armenians would 
  help exterminate Jews Armenians were also hearty proponents of
  the antiSemitic acts in league with the Russian Communists

I suspect it might have to do with PanTurkism blinding certain people

You don't get it  do you During the years of World War I the xSoviet 
Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the 
Muslim people which not only took the lives of  million Muslim people 
but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants 
To this day Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the xSoviet Armenia 
In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish 
homeland which is the crux of Turkish political demands fascist xSoviet 
Armenia continues its antiTurkish policy in the following ways

 xSoviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility

 xSoviet Armenia employing ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish 
Genocide

 xSoviet Armenia has also implemented statesponsored terrorism through
the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests

 Using all its human financial and governmental resources xSoviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism bribery and other subversive methods nonTurkish supporters
of the Turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian

Using all the aforementioned methods the xSoviet Armenian Government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue

Yet despite the efforts of the xSoviet Armenian Government and its 
terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks 
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically 
exterminated by the Armenians the international wall of silence on 
this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of 
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition 
of the Turkish Genocide

With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages the Turkish and Kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle therefore the victims
of the Turkish Genocide demand

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government as the heirs of the Armenian 
Dictatorship recognize the Turkish Genocide

 that xSoviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people

 that the xSoviet Armenian Government make material reparations for 
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide

 that all world governments and especially the United States officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure

 that the US Government free itself from the friendly position it 
has adopted towards its unreliable ally xSoviet Armenia and officially 
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be 
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands

 that the xSoviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact 
of the Turkish Genocide and include the coldblooded extermination of 
 million Muslim people in their history books

Serdar how can a former government pay anything  Also what is this crap 
about  a genocide of muslims  There was no such thing I won't bother 

There's your problem right there 'ASALASDPAARF' crooksidiots stole
your brain Just watch

Source World Alive A Personal Story by Robert Dunn Crown Publishers 
Inc New York  
Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of  
 million Muslim people

p  seventh paragraph and p  first paragraph

 'The most are inside houses Come you and look'
 'No dammit My stomach isn't'
 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform Him you must see'
 We were under those trees by the mosque in an open space
 'I don't believe you I said but followed to a nailstudded door The 
  man pushed it ajar then spurred away leaving me to check on the corpse 
  I thought I should this charge was so constant so gritted my teeth and 
  went inside

 The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes and was dark at first for 
 its stone walls had only window slits Rags strewed the mud floor around an 
 iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black 
 with soot All looked bare and empty but in an inner room flies buzzed As 
 the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face 
 up naked but for its grimy turban He was about fifty years old by what 
 was left of his face  a rifle butt had bashed an eye The one left slanted 
 as with Tartars rather than with Turks Any uniform once on him was gone so 
 I'd no proof which he was and quickly went out gagging at the mess of his  
 slashed genitals

p  first paragraph 

 'How many people lived there'
 'Oh about eight hundred' He yawned
 'Did you see any Turk officers'
 'No sir I was in at dawn All were Tartar civilians in mufti'

 The lieutenant dozed off then I but in the small hours a voice woke me  
 Dro's He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer Anyone keelhauled
 so long and furiously I'd never heard Then abruptly Dro broke into 
 laughter quick and simple as child's Both were a cover for his sense
 of guilt I thought or hoped For somehow despite my boast of irreligion
 Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
 have been

 From daybreak on Armenian villagers poured in from miles around
 The women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over
 the carcass of Djul They hauled out every hovel's chattels the last 
 scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags 
 looms even spinningwheels

 'Thank you for a lot Dro' I said to him back in camp 'But now I must 
 leave'We shook hands the captain said 'A bientot mon camarade' And 
 for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains 
 Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in 
 a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran'

p 

At morning tea Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
 high region called the Karabakh Deep in tactics they spoke Russian
 but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
 of promises made by tribal chiefs A campaign shaped more raids on
 Moslem villages

p 

It will be three hours to take Dro told me We'd close in on three
 sides
The men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets Merrimanov
said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow
That is for morale Dro put in We must keep the Moslems in terror
Soldiers or civilians I asked
There is no difference said Dro All are armed in uniform or not
But the women and children
Will fly with the others as best they may

p 

The ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still Hundreds of feet 
 down the fog held solid as cotton flock 'Djul lies under that' said 
 Dro pointing 'Our men also attack from the other sides'

 Then 'Wheeee'  his whistle lined up all at the rock edge Bayonets
 clicked upon carbines Over plunged Archo his black haunches rippling
 then followed the staff the horde  nose to tail bellies taking the
 spur Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though 
 I heard our Utica brass roar

 As I watched from the height it took ages for Djul to show clear A tsing
 of machinegun fire took over from the thumping batteries cattle lowed
 dogs barked invisible while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
 puddle Mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly
 The came a shrill wailing

 Now among the cloudstreaks rose darker wisps  smoke Red glimmered about
 house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs A mosque stood in
 clump of trees thick and green Through crooked alleys on fire horsemen
 were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot

 'Tartarski' shouted the gunner by me Others pantomimed them in escape
 over the rocks while one twisted a bronze shellnose loaded and yanked
 breechcord firing again and again Shots wasted I thought when by
 afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body But these shots and
 the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries

 At length all shooting petered out I got on my horse and rode down toward
 Djul It burned still but little flame showed now The way was steep and 
 tough through dense scrub Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly
 through alders on smoldering houses Across trampled wheat my brothersin
 arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb

p  fourth paragraph

Corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair 
 large eyes She looked about twelve years old She lay in some stubble 
 where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting The bayonet 
 had gone through her back I judged for blood around was scant Between 
 the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun 
 dress

 The next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and kneepants He 
 lay face down in the path by several huts One arm reached out to the 
 pewter bowl he'd carried now upset upon its dough Steel had jabbed 
 just below his neck into the spine 

 There were grownups too I saw as I led the sorrel around Djul was 
 empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's Germanspeaking 
 colonel He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead

p 

 more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled
  north My hosts told me of their duty here to keep tabs on brigands 
  Turkish troop shifts hidden arms spies  Christian Red or Tartar 
  coming in from Transcaucasus Then they spoke of the hell that would 
  break loose if Versailles were to put as threatened the six 'Armenian'
  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan

  An Armenia without Armenians Turks under Christian rule His lips
  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache That's bloodshed  just
  Smyrna over again on a bigger scale

Nice strategy Sedar maybe if you can make up SO many stories about what  
happened in WWI you will confuse everybody into forgetting the Armenian  

Ah those poor genocide apologists Such quaintly charming habits of the
Armenian barbarism and fascism No swinging of lies will be enough to cover 
up the crimes of the xSoviet Armenian Government Not a chance Now let 
the Kurdish scholars speak for themselves

Source Hassan Arfa The Kurds London  pp 

 When the Russian armies invaded Turkey after the Sarikamish disaster 
  of  their columns were preceded by battalions of irregular 
  Armenian volunteers both from the Caucasus and from Turkey One of 
  these was commanded by a certain Andranik a bloodthirsty adventurer
  These Armenian volunteers committed all kinds of excesses more
  than six hundred thousand Kurds being killed between  and  in 
  the eastern vilayets of Turkey

Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning
 with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken
 in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated When the Russian army
 withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian
 massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked
 in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places
 selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs
 were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
 being subjected to every conceivable abominable act A very small part 
 of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the
 cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering
 from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived
 in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to
 Including women and children such persons discovered so far do not
 exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in
 Erzurum All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled everything
 that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them
 in a destitute situation At the present time the people are subsisting
 on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from Russian storages
 left behind after their occupation of this area

p  second paragraph

 I had received further very definite information of horrors that
  had been committed by the Armenian soldiery in Kars Plain and as 
  I had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their 
  treatment of my own detached parties I had wired to Tiflis from 
  Zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the Armenians should not 
  be left in independent command of the Moslem population as their 
  troops being without discipline and not under effective control 
  atrocities were constantly being committed for which we should 
  with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible'

p  third paragraph

 Armenian troops who having pillaged and destroyed all the
  Moslem villages in the plain

 Caravans of refugees were in the meanwhile constantly arriving from the
  plain from which the whole Moslem population was fleeing with as much of
  their personal property as they could transport seeking to obtain security
  and protection

p  first paragraph

 In those Moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched 
  for arms by the Armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of 
  such search and not only had many Moslems been killed but horrible 
  tortures had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as 
  to where valuables had been hidden of which the Armenians were aware 
  of the existence although they had been unable to find them

p  first paragraph

 the Armenians from the plain were attacking the Kurdish line with 
  artillery with probably a large force in support

p  first paragraph

 The arrival of this British brigade was followed by the announcement
  that Kars Province had been allotted by the Supreme Council of the
  Allies to the Armenians and that announcement having been made the
  British troops were then completely withdrawn and Armenian occupation
  commenced Hence all the trouble for the Armenians at once commenced
  the wholesale robbery and persecution of the Muslem population on the
  pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms
  In the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able
  to carry out their purpose and the manner in which this was done will
  be referred to in due course

I always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history
are condemned to repeat it Will Durant  but I am beginning to
believe the opposite is true

Here in tpm and in other newsgroups it seems that history is
mainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club In the
history of my own people there are ample acts of shame both done
by my people and done to my people Since I was not party to any
of those acts I refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my
ancestors committed nor do I direct hatred toward the descendants
of those who committed evil acts against my ancestors

The obsession with discussions of past or present events seems to be
largely centered on trying to prove that they are worse than us
As we see over and over that leads nowhere except to make ourselves
feel superior It's as if we've become addicted to periodic injections
of selfaffirmation that draw their power from denigration of the
other and romanticization of ourselves The hope is that we will begin 
sometime to apply these discussions in some way towards consideration of 
how to defuse the situation advancement of negotiations and the search 
for common ground between the parties involved
 
Of course for this to happen we can't believe that the best path to 
making ourselves feel better is at the expense of others As long as 
those valuing the coming together of opposing parties do not pursue 
their vision with the same passion as do those polarization specialists 
we will stay stuck in the circus of oneupsmanship we now have We're
getting precisely what we are willing to work for

    agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel

    You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image 
    of several Israeli leaders  I can't say if you actually HATE
    these leaders but the lies and misrepresentations of them do
    suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them
    
    So while you claim that you do not hate anybody there is an
    ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is 
    false  It is obvious that you hate Israel and it is evident
    that you hate the Jewish people

    And if you are Jewish you are a selfhating Jew  There can
    be no doubt of this  Although you will call upon your Jewish
    background in an effort to claim the high moral ground there
    is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade
    away completely as a people  Your advocacy of intermarriage
    for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that 
    you hate the Jewish people

    And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your
    own Jewishness on all Jews you've clearly demonstrated to me 
    that you hate yourself

Providing safety and security for one's own people is the most
fundamental responsibility of any political entity For the Palestinian
leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility ie take the
responsibility to protect their people from radical Palestinian elements
who are opposed to the peace process is reprehensible To argue that a
Palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful
political groups only reinforces the reality that the Palestinian
leadership so far can not exercise control over radical Palestinian
elements nor effectively deal with the killing of Palestinians by
Palestinians This is a problem that can only be solved by the
Palestinian people

In article benalialcor benalialcorconcordiaca  ILYESS B BDIRA  writes

So how would have you defended Saudi Arabia and rolled
back the Iraqi invasion were you in charge of Saudi Arabia

All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq not
to Liberate Kuwait The people who were killed by the invasion are
more many many more than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis
in their smaller invasion I lived in the west and I have seen how 
your media prepared you helpless naive Americans for a war against
Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that
led to the invasion as the CIA correctly predicted and pretended to
be surprised not to know
It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid

What would I have done Most Muslims would choose  dead Kuwaitis over
 dead Iraqis and  dead Kuwaitis The first case would happen
if no western intervention happened and the second case was a direct
or indirect result of western envolvement

Human rights in Kuwait what about human rights in Iraq why the west
gave Saddam a green light to slaughter his own people I will give my
reason because the rich Kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves so
they deserve some democracy but Iraqis might not so they don't

As simple as that whether or not you want to admit it

I think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an
official religion de facto or de jure because with human nature
like it is the ambitious and not the pious will always be the
ones who rise to power  There are just too many people in this
world or any country for the citizens to really know if a 
leader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator

Not necessarily the best solution my view of an Islamic state and
that of Turabi that your media made you hate includes all the benefits
of a secular state minus the injustices Did you ever read a book by
Rashid AlGhannoushi Tunisia Hassan Turabi Sudan You only know
about them from your Selfcensured selfcontrolled media

If they make this kind of campaign against such a moderate thinker as
Turabi is and keep quite about such an extremist Muslim scholar as Bin
Bez of Saudi Arabia is it just does not encourage any moderation in
our ARab world

You make it sound like these guys are angels Ilyess  In your
clarinet posting you edited out some stuff was it the following

No it was not that it was just some irrelevent stuff that I took out
to go around the copyright 

I ceased to take the Newyork times seriously In issues concerning Islam
it has become one of the biggest enemies although less than the other
NewYork daily since Mortimer took it over It lies selects facts that
fits its agenda and even prints racist and open antiMuslim editorials

What they claimed in that articles is a bunch of lies because while 
the selected facts are true about some of those persons the other members
are actually defence lawyers and University science professors who wanted
to fight corruption uncover atrocities against opposition activists and
Shia minority and generally increase awareness about the rights of all 
citizens The only thing that is common between those people is their concern
for the deterioration of human rights since the Saudi clan took a green
light from AMerica after the gulf to do whatever is necessary to stay
in power 


Do you know that ALL OF THE SAUDI ULEMA have been taught the same things
the ones in the official Iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are
opposing it SOme of the members of the human rights committe are MORE
PROWOMEN and wanted to defend them and that is precisely one reason that
Bin Bez's Fatwah  implied for the Illegality  of this committee
and  for his claim that it represents Outside interests

There is a human rights issue in Saudi ARabia and YOU and NY times chose
to ignore the main issue and select some of the members of that committee
and actually defend the actions done against them including banning them
from their Jobs

What a hypocricy I am not surprised really THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

The official Ulema are the most extremist antiwomen meatheads in Saudi
Arabia the west continues on its campaign to discredit itself in the
Muslim community by supporting them Well after Bosnia I guess it has
ZERO credibility to begin with so what the heck

Idha Lam tastahi Faf'aal Ma shi'it If you feel no shame then do whatever 
you want Hadith  
actually a better translation of the meaning would be If you do not
feel ashamed from God you will do whatever you want

Yeah  That's it   You've really outdone yourself this time Nick
Don't forget the Davidian Muslims 

Islam is not a race  It's a religion  You can be white black
Fijian or Alaskan  I guess you didn't absorb too much of the Malcolm
X interest circulating  You see the whole point of Islam is that it
stresses equality amongst all peoples  Now I do realize this is
difficult for you to comprehend given your staunch beliefs in Serbian
ethnic cleansing but give it a try it's really not that difficult

Is your stomach all right Unable to digest your lunch
Cool down In the context of Bosnia muslims are a nation
And nobody talked about them being a race

 It is a
 civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
 instead of pens  The Croat Muslim and Serb political leaders all
 chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
 peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements 

Terms of secession  You are of course joking right Nick  Nobody
chose to fight  Bosnia and Croatia were internationally
recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their
welldocumented genocide  That makes them an outside aggressor  It's
a simple genocide a classical example of ethnic cleansing  There is
no question of civil war

And Yugoslavia was a recognized nation If you apply the principle 
of self determination to Yugoslavia then you should apply it to
Croatia and Bosnia Of course you might want to apply again to
Kossovo

Actually just after the FIRST world war many Muslims were killed by

Under Serbianled regime between the two world wars many Croats were

Josip

please don't be offended at this question Who are the Muslims in the
Bosnian context i know that a moslemmuslim is a believer in Islam
Islam 
is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world But it is
not
 yes definitely not an ethinic group ok so these Bosnian Muslims
who
are they to which ethnic group do they belong what languages do they
speak do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or
Croats 
the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle
has 
kept me wondering when the meaning of muslimmoslem i knew from
childhood was 
changed in the dictionary this is just a question no flames intended

oguocha


You've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide 
Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity They speak SerboCroatian But
there is a ChristoSlavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian
and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by
changing religion  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric
who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls
the people ie Christian slavs For this reason the warcriminals
call all the Bosnian Muslims Turks even though they are not ethnically
Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language  For this reason
what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically
identical but religiously other is called paradoxically ethnic
cleansing rather than religious cleansing

You are somewhat close to truth But you shouldn't forget that
nationality is a recent invention of the western europe In the
days of the Ottoman empire the religion was the main point of
difference between social classes The Ottomans didn't recognize
Turks Arabs Greeks Serbs Just christians muslims jews
So for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the
bosnian muslims were Turks After all there aren't many real 
ethnic Turks living even in Turkey today Even in Europe it's
the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of
one's culture

Thus while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of
WWII and older agenda the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from
Bosnian is being carried out under the cover of the SerboCroat war

Can you support this

I believe that things are getting mixed here
Critizicing Israel andor being antizionist is not seeing the absolute 
negatives of that culture 

If that culture referred to is Israeli being antizionist can be seen
as a complete denial of that entity's right to exist and its legitimacy 
Just as saying that Islam has no right to establish and implement a 
state that includes any nonmuslims both are absolute onedimensional 
views of that culture with regard to the issue of state

Maybe because a person can see the positives 
of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the
State of Israel

If that were the case one would expect a few of that culture's positives
to be discussed with regard to the issue at hand Since the issue centers
on Israeli culture I have yet to hear of any positives of that culture
in this discussion

I for one consider the actions of the State of Israel with respect to
the human rights of the Palestinian people as an example of an action thaty
opposes what Jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of 
respect and what the Jewish people learned about oppresion segregation and
years in the diaspora

I agree with you But I also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted 
by another group that wishes to see that culture disassembled the first
culture has little choice but to try to secure its survival as well as
maintain its moral center Since the culture is not about to turn away
from either the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral 
principles it has the virtually impossible job of balancing 

To discuss Israel's faults and crimes without any recognition of this
circumstance and reality it faces is a conscious decision based on the 
discussant's political biases NOT on an honest and empathetically open 
understanding of the situation The same applies to those who attempt to 
paint the Palestinian movement as all bad and dispense with considerations 
of the reality facing them

That certainly describes Elias 
since he has no intention of recognizing that alongside the Palestinian
experience and perspective there exists also that of Israelis 

He might not want to recognize that It does not make him a selfhating
Jew as far as I see it At most he is a person who is not telling
the truth

You beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue
of selfhating addresses the motivations I certainly feel that
anyone who expends so much effort inflating distorting and robbing
human context from aspects of hisher own culture is reflecting
a degree of dislike for it Since bits of that culture are bound 
due to hisher upbringing to be a part of himher a bit of self
dislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere

    Who is a Jew  A person whose integrity decays when unmoved 
    by the knowledge of wrong done to other people

As you well know this process of blaming the other for the morally
questionable actions one side is forced by the other of course to 
take is thoroughly practiced by both sides If you are only hearing
the proIsraeli crowd's selfsupporting arguments that may be due to
the fact that you are not listening for anything else I certainly
hear the similarly distorting proPalestinianproArab element in
this newsgroup as well as in socculturearabic

There is always and excuse There is always a rationale to explain why
things happen as they do And what is the worst part for me there 
seems to be all the time an intention to try to dehumanize the other

I agree agree agree agree

However in my response to the initial discussion above between Davidsson
and those opposing his presentations I saw Davidsson carefully putting 
academic frills around a blatantly onesided series of Ihatedislike
them yesIdoyesIdoyesIdo I did not find the approach of those 
opposing Davidsson to be centered at all on a denigration and denial
of the other side 

I certainly do wonder if the degree to which Davidsson's views on the 
Middle East have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection
of his jewish lineage Having said this however I agree with you that 
this constant accusing others of being selfhating jews seems
pointless It is not worse a label than is why you're on their side
except to perhaps imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic 
biasedness

attack an act of revenge'' for the killing of their comrades

The annihilation of Islam Turks is an older Serbian agenda  

	Indeed so was annihilation of Germans during WWII  However it is 
	important to quote Adil Zuflikarpasic in his interview to Duga
	
	Had Serbs wanted to exterminate Muslims they could have done it 
	after the WWI when they were the most loved small nation in 
	Europe  
	
	Serbs did not do that although they supressed some rebellions 
	by Albanian Muslims and Bosnian Muslims quite bloodily  However

This is quite a misrepresentation  After WWI many Bosnian Muslims were
killed and their land taken over by Serbs and the motive was plunder
not some fictitious supression of rebellion  Even earlier one can
point to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of
Muslims  Here is what Dr Vaso Cubrilovic political adviser to the
Serbian monarchic regime says in his memorandum The Expulsion of the
Arnauts which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic
on March   in Belgrade

   The Mode of Removal
   

    describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed
   through state terror and private initiative ie Chetnik plunder 

   Private initiative too can assist greatly in this direction  We should
   distribute weapons to our colonists as need be  The old forms of Chetnik
   action should be organized and secretly assisted  
   the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and
   if need be ascribed to economic reasons  Finally local riots can be
   incited  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the
   Chetniks rather than the army

   There remains one more means WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL
   EFFECT AFTER  that is by secretly burning down Albanian villages
   and city quarters

Emphasis above is mine  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually
all Muslims during late th century  This policy of state terrorism
against Muslims aided by Chetnik private initiative has continued in WWII
and today  For example Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book Od tradicije do 
identiteta Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana Sarajevo
Svjetlost  writes pg  how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca
in WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot explaining
their action as follows

   Inasmuch as you were a Serb you sullied the Serb name because you
   are a Turk ie Muslim  And since you helped us we shall not
   torture you

so the shot him instead of cutting his throat  In the past year Serbs
have repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca  Destruction
of mosques including priceless historical monuments completes the
eradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs


I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda
in fact for the past century or two Croats and Muslims have seen
themselves as having a lot in common and they generally had friendly
relations  Your suggestion that CroatMuslim relationship is 
anything like SerbMuslim relationship is completely wrong

To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply
they are not separate peoples  

	How touching  I have nearly cried while I read this  Unfortunately
	mostly untrue

Which part do you claim is untrue  Explain yourself or withdraw your claim

	Croats from Croatia mostly had no contacts with Muslims since they
	were mostly dealt with extreme preudice long time ago However 
	one of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state

Croatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons because it
was not a part of the Ottoman Empire  The last major battles between
AustroHungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the
end of the th century  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism
came into being with Dr Ante Starcevic who saw Bosnian Muslims as the
best Croats so much so that in  he contemplated moving his operations 
to Sarajevo  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian
nationalism here   Political nationalism has always been stronger  As
for your other theories you are clearly overjoyed that CroatMuslim
alliance in BosniaHerzegovina is now in trouble  Arguments such as
yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split  

	I should add few more things  AJ Evans in his On Foot Through
	BH describes that Catholic clergy in the last century was 
	apparently more scared by Serbs then by Turks because Serbs were
	growing stronger and unlike Turks represented great danger for
	idea of Catholic Bosnia  President Tudjman clearly states in 
	his book that Muslims do not exist as a separate nation from 
	Croats and Serbs and he many times suggested even in interviewes to
	foreign papers that solution is to split Bosnia
 
	Josip knows this and he is only working on the image of Croatia

In international relations  you'll learn that unless weak unite to
counterbalance the strong player soon they are taken over and that's the
end of them  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats
and Bosnian Muslims  This is only natural all other alignments are
unstable  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact Croats and
Muslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed  
You are wrong if you think only image is at stake here  Croatia has
a deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims and vice versa  

I think Tudjman understands this although he does not have much choice 
at this point  Tensions should have been defused better earlier before 
any open confrontation developed  Although I still think Croatia will
survive it will lose a lot but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse
off  However their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not
see it getting any worse  The key point is do they still have any hope left
If not then all bets are off

Mr Stojanovic is clearly very very happy about this  I'm deeply hurt
This is not about some image but about survival of a concept of a
partnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats
and Muslims  

Sigh
Josip

This is a very impotant update I will omit just a few lines and add
some overhead for the sake of the copyright 

I say despite all the bad news for Muslims around the world things are
shaping up very well a lot of killings might happen in the near future
though as if Bosnia is not a lot
Right now I feel like saying what Martillo said  the stage is set
I don't think that things will be the same in ten year 
On the pessimisticrealistic side we can only see the stage set for more
wars imposed on our people and governments being remote controlled
to fight each other and to oppress their own people but I am confident
they will all fall
I venture to list the order SudanYemen alliance AlgeriaLibya in  years
Tunisia one year later but Egypt may face direct colonization very soon to
prevent an Islamic government which might take over after Egypt attacks 
SUdan and is envolved in atrocities there as it fails to achieve
victory  Meanwhile Saudia faces a civil war and goes to war 
with YemenSudan over it  The new North African 
Alliance AlgeriaTunLibya goes to war with Morocco who attacks it
USFrance involved everywhere but cannot concentrate on one place 
especially that SyriaJordanIraq have to be kept under control

After the cloud clears I do not know what the end result will be

OK back to reality

 	CAIRO Egypt UPI  The Cairobased Arab Organization for Human
 Rights AOHR Sunday called on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to order the
 release of members of the kingdom's first human rights group


	Among those group wants released was Mohamed Ben Abdullah Al Masaari
 spokesman of the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights CDLR
 Al Masaari was arrested just before dawn Saturday at his residence in
 Riyadh's King Faisal University where he worked as a physics professor
human rights and media sources reported
 	The media reports said Saudi security forces also seized
 publications books correspondence and other documents and papers from
 Al Masaari's residence He was reportedly taken to an unknown
destination
 	The Londonbased Liberty human rights group claimed that the other
five members who together with Al Massari formed CDLR on May  were
 summoned for police questioning and might have been detained as well
 	On Thursday the Saudi government ordered the firing and disbarment
 of the six activists because they established the group urging people in
the kingdom with grievances to report to CDLR
	Four of the activists were sacked from their positions with two
 staterun Saudi universities and two government departments and two
lawyers including Al Masaari's father were disbarred and their law
offices were closed the AOHR said
	The other lawyer Suleiman Al Rashoudi was described by AOHR as the
first ever to practice law in the kingdom
	AOHR also claimed that about  other people might have been
arrested around the country in connection with the CDLR They were
apparently people who have either responded to the group's call for
reports on grievances or others closely linked to the founders
	Saudi authorities were reported to have also been angered by reports
that Al Masaari and others have met with US diplomats based in Riyadh

	The kingdom's highest religious authority the Higher Council of
Ulema Muslim scholars Wednesday condemned the creation of the rights
group as illegal and unnecessary and warned of what it called 
regrettable ramifications'' the establishment of CDLR could have
	AOHR whose  report listed human rights violations in Saudi
Arabia criticized the Ulema's position and argued that the kingdom's
Islamic laws and courts did not preclude the creation of human rights
groups

	GAZA CITY IsraeliOccupied Gaza Strip UPI  Palestinian gunmen
Sunday shot and killed two Israelis who entered Gaza to buy cheap
produce and two Arabs who were assisting them
	Elsewhere in the crowded strip Israeli troops killed a monthold
infant and a yearold boy during rockthrowing clashes at two refugee
camps
can anybody guess this from the title

Can anyone figure out what kind of deranged parent was stupid enough to
bring their infant on a rock throwing crusade or jihad sorry  month
old infants certainly don't walk around the streets on their own  That would
lead me to believe that some nimrod of a parent brought them along for a 
little terrorism

Not me I thought that a clash between Israelis and Arabs resulted
in four deaths on one side and two on the other

thats what happened

	The driveby shooting outside the Jewish settlement of Gadid in
southern Gaza prompted Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to warn Israelis
they were endangering their lives'' by doing illegal business in the
occupied territories

How about being illegally settled there
I am not sure about the signals the Israelis are sending one day
they are willing to accept a JordanWest Bank federation the other
they do not recognize the west bank as occupied territory neither
did the US the honest brocker
details of the killings omitted PLOHamas graffiti both claim responsability

Uhm last I heard the territories were disputed  Israel's occupation is not
illegal  They are legally allowed to remain there until a settlement is reached
with the arabs which from the behavior of the Palestinian negotitating team
will probably be never

	The Israelis had entered Gaza in a car driven by the man from Hebron

Now don't tell me that this could not be an Israeli spy
We will know later

huh  they were buying vegetables


which carried the easily identified blue license plates of Arab vehicles
in the West Bank When Israelis enter Gaza with their own cars which

        Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander
        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War
        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov

The things I have heard and seen during the two months until the
 liberation of Erzurum by the Turks have surpassed all the
 allegations concerning the vicious degenerate characteristic of
 the Armenians During the Russian occupation of Erzurum no Armenian
 was permitted to approach the city and its environs

 While the Commander of the First Army Corps General Kaltiyin remained
 in power troops including Armenian enlisted men were not sent to the
 area When the security measures were lifted the Armenians began to 
 attack Erzurum and its surroundings Following the attacks came the
 plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder
 of the owners of these housesPlundering was widely committed by
 the soldiers This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers
 who had remained in the rear during the war

 One day while passing through the streets on horseback a group of
 soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of
 seventy years in a certain direction The roads were covered with mud
 and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud
 and dirt

 It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and
 traps The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds
 and withdrew The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night
 patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them The 
 Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear
 also Finally the Court Martial which had been established for the
 trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for
 fear that they themselves would be punished The incidents of murder
 and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently

 Sometime in January and February a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir
 Efendi from Erzurum was killed one night at his home The Commander
 in Chief Odiselidge gave orders to find murderers within three days
 The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals
 that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its
 highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half
 of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned

 We learnt the details this incident from the CommanderinChief
 Odishelidge They were as follows

 The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the
 act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades
 More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been
 killed in Erzincan Large holes were dug and the defenceless 
 Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes Later the
 murdered Turks were thrown into the holes The Armenian who stood 
 near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses
 'Seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more' Thus ten
 more Turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when
 the hole was full it would be covered over with soil

 The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently
 fill a house with eighty Turks and cut their heads off one by one
 Following the Erzincan massacre the Armenians began to withdraw
 towards Erzurum The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew
 to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road and
 destroyed the entire population together with the villages

 During the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages
 that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the 
 Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages While the travellers
 were passing through Erzurum the Armenians took advantage of the time
 when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill
 the Kurds they had hired When the Russian soldiers heard the cries
 of the dying Kurds they attempted to help them However the 
 Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would
 have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from
 acting All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with
 hatred and loathing

 Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that
 he witnessed in Erzurum as follows An Armenian had shot a Kurd The
 Kurd fell down but did not die The Armenian attempted to force the
 stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd However since
 the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the Armenian failed
 in his attempt Having seen this the Armenian ripped open the abdomen
 of the Kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping
 him with the iron heel of his boot

 Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape
 from the village of Ilica were killed Their heads had been cut off
 by axes He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered
 children Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov who passed through the village
 of Ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following

 There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads
 Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and
 spat on the corpses In the courtyard of a mosque which was about
 x meter square dead bodies were piled to a height of  
 centimeters Among these corpses were men and women of every age
 children and old people The women's bodies had obvious marks of
 rape The genitals of many girls were filled with gunpowder

 A few educated Armenian girls who worked as telephone operators
 for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov
 to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be 
 proud of what the Armenians had done To the lieutenant colonel's
 disgusted amazement the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle
 instead of being horrified The lieutenant colonel had severely
 reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour When he told
 the girls that the Armenians including women were generally more
 licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent
 and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity
 and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers
 the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and
 claimed they had laughed because they were nervous

 An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command
 narrated the following incident which took place on February 

 The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall They had cut
 out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head
 The great massacre in Erzurum began on February  The enlisted men 
 of the artillery division caught and stripped  people Then they
 took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts  people
 among this group were able to save their lives as the result of
 my decisive attempts The others the Armenians claimed were 
 released when they learnt that I understood what was going on 
 Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the
 Armenian officers Karagodaviev Today some Turks were murdered
 on the streets

 On February  some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent
 Moslems The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were
 threatened with death Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for
 murdering an innocent Turk 

 When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would 
 be hanged for his crime the killer shouted furiously 'How dare
 you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk' In Erzurum the 
 Armenians burned down the Turkish market On February  I heard
 that the entire population of Tepekoy village situated within
 the artillery area had been totally annihilated On the same 
 day when Antranik entered Erzurum I reported the massacre to
 him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible
 act However no result was achieved

 In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was a
 natural silence On the night of  February the Armenians deceived
 the Russians perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the 
 Turkish soldiers Later it was understood that this massacre had
 been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular 
 The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed
 one by one The number of murders committed on that night reached
 three thousand It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details
 of the massacre The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers
 were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even
 withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred
 people and two cannons for one night and ran away The leading
 Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre
 However the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with
 the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others The lower
 classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders
 of the leading Armenian figures and commanders 

 I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals
 were accessories to these murders No for there were people who
 opposed the Armenians for such actions since they understood that
 it would yield no result However such people were only a minority
 Furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian
 cause Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have
 supported the massacres secretly Some on the other hand preferred
 to remain silent There were certain others who when accused by
 the Russians of infamy would say the following 'You are Russians
 You can never understand the Armenian cause' The Armenians had a
 conscience They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear
 of the Turkish soldiers

 The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real
 nature of the Armenian ideology Nothing which is already done can
 be undone

Answer Don't ask  Don't even think about it  Just put this line into your
global kill file

Well does it change the fact that during the period of  to  
the Armenian Government ordered incited assisted and participated 
in the genocide of  million Muslim people because of race religion
and national origin

Between  and   million Turks perished of butchery at the 
hands of Armenians The genocide involved not only the killing of 
innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia 
They were persecuted banished and slaughtered while much of Ottoman 
Army was engaged in World War I The Genocide Treaty defines genocide 
as acting with a 

  'specific intent to destroy in whole or in substantial part a 
   national ethnic racial or religious group' 

History shows that the xSoviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate 
the Muslim population  million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the 
Armenians International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time  including 
US Ambassador Bristol  denounced the xSoviet Armenian Government's policy 
as a massacre of the Kurds Turks and Tartars The bloodthirsty leaders of 
the xSoviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the 
extermination of the Muslims The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor 
those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians 

The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established
beyond any doubt that the massacres against the Muslim people
during the war were planned and premeditated The aim of the policy
was clearly the extermination of all Turks in xSoviet Armenian 
territories

The Muslims of Van Bitlis Mus Erzurum and Erzincan districts and
their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed
The massacres in Trabzon Tercan Yozgat and Adana were organized and
perpetrated by the bloodthirsty leaders of the xSoviet Armenian 
Government

The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were

 defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder
 the inhabitants pillage the village and often burn the village

 people think  of Azeri soil is now occupied by the fascist 
 xSoviet Armenian Government Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri 
 town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris The Parisbased 
 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts 
 the number of Khojali victims at  Some of the dead were 
 scalped and mutilated 

Sedar

It is 'Serdar' 'kocaoglan'

Have you ever even considered buying a dictionary  Do you evn know the  
definition of fascist  Why don't you LOOK IT UP POST IT UP HERE AND PROVE  

Just say so


 The SUNDAY TIMES  March 

 Morgues fill as Azeris head for allout war
 

 Thomas Goltz the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in
 the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union reports from
 Agdam
 

 Khojaly used to be a barren town with empty shops and treeless dirt
 roads Yet it was still home to thousands of people who in happier
 times tended fields and flocks of geese Last week it was wiped off
 the map

 

 As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of
 Agdam and the bodies piled up in the morgues there was little doubt
 that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been
 the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke
 apart
 

 I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly That was in january and
 people were predicting their fate with grim resignation Zumrut Ezoya
 a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the
 town called her community sitting ducks ready to get shot She and
 her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 
 

 The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages one by one and
 the government does nothing Balakisi Sakikov  a father of five
 said Next they will drive us out or kill us all said Dilbar his
 wife The couple their three sons and three daughters were killed in
 the assault as were many other people I had spoken to
 

 It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross
 There was a road and the first units of the column ran across then
 all hell broke loose Bullets were raining down from all sides we had
 just entered their trap

 The azeri defenders picked off one by one Survivors say that Armenian
 forces then began a pitiless slaughter firing at anything moved in
 the gullies A video taken by an azeri cameraman wailing and crying
 as he filmed body after body showed a grizzly trail of death leading
 towards higher forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge
 from the Armenians

 The Armenians just shot and shot and shot said Omar Veyselov lying
 in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds I saw my wife and
 daughter fall right by me

 People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the
 loved ones Some vented their fury on foreigners  Where is my
 daughter where is my son  wailed a mother Raped Butchered Lost

 Azerbaijan has said as many as  refugees were killed as they
 tried to flee The Armenians have denied this saying the civilians
 were caught in crossfire

The above explained propaganda which certainly has nothing to do with 
the true facts is also today the main source of ASALASDPAARF terrorists'
illegal activities that still try to make money out of the bodies of 
the innocent victims of the Turkish genocide

The criminal acts of the xSoviet Armenian Government come directly
under the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General 
Assembly of the United Nations on December   containing the 
following provisions

The Contracting Parties having considered the declaration made 
by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution
  dated December   that genocide is a crime under
international law contrary to the spirit and aims of the United
Nations and condemned by the civilized world

Recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted
great losses on humanity and

Being convinced that in order to liberate mankind from such odious
scourge international cooperation is required

Members agree as hereinafter provided

Article  The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide whether
committed in time of peace or in time of war is a crime under 
international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish

Article  In the present Convention genocide means any of the
following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or
in part a national ethnical racial or religious group as 
such

A Killing member of the group
B Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group
C Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life 
   calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole 
   or in part
D Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group
E Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group

Article  The following acts shall be punishable

a Genocide
b Conspiracy to commit genocide
c Direct and public incitement to commit genocide
d Attempt to commit genocide

Article  Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts
enumerated in Article  shall be punished whether they are
constitutionally responsible rulers public officials or private
individuals

Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian 
massacres of the Turks and Kurds it would probably have been 
difficult for the xSoviet Armenian Government and its responsibles
to start murdering of civilian defenseless faithful Ottoman
citizens children and women GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE
to make plans to exterminate as they have done also to Urartus
and Jews faithful Ottoman citizens CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE 
to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority
and to commit Genocide DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT
GENOCIDE

MY GOSH Sedar WHAT ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT  Armenia didn't even become  

No wonder you clown are in such a mess Let's take Sarkis Atamian's an 
Armenian Dashnak sociolog book The Armenian Community pages  and 
 Atamian quotes

  the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and
 tactics of revolution The liberation of Armenia the immediate aim of
 the Party was to be attained by

       Oral and written propaganda
       Terrorism  both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure
         of self defense 
       The creation of an avantgarde of revolutionary groups to be
         equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared
         for a general uprising
       The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with
         each other and subject to a central body
       Organization of units of guerilla fighters

Now on page  Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution

  If the means was revolution how was the revolution to be attained
 By

       Propaganda 
       Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination
       Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people
       The arming of the people
       Organization of revolutionary committees
       Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with
         the official bodies and journals
       Organization of financial zones for public collection 
       'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government
         officers spies traitors grafters and all sorts of oppressors
       Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry
      Building of roads for the transport of arms
      Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions

Many of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people 
were committed by the brainwashed members of the Tzeghagron namely 
raceworshipers of the Dashnag Youth Organization Ironically again 
Tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi Karekin Nejdeh

Pardon me Your ignorance cramps my conversation Although the administrative 
mechanism was a strictly centralized one the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical 
example of a pluralist social order' The 'millet system' was the mechanism 
which shaped the social order of the multinational Ottoman Empire and stood 
behind its continuity As a matter of fact because Islamic principles 
were in force in the Ottoman Empire it was natural to use religious 
criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted 
the Empire The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the 
th century under the influence of nationalism Sousa writes of the 
existence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to 
the Muslim 'millet' in  These were  Greeks attached to the 
Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul  Catholics or Latins who were

It  was five years ago that Karabakh voted overwhelmingly to seperate 
from  Azerbaijan why is the UN not enforcing their will

Is that how the mind of a compulsive liar works The scenario and 
genocide staged by the Armenians  years ago in xSoviet Armenia 
is being reenacted again  this time in Azerbaijan There are remarkable 
similarities between the plots the perpetrators and the underdogs 

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre

 year old Hatin Nine telling

''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes They told
me We won't kill you But the babies have to die in front of your eyes''

 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu

 ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours
  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said You are
  Turks you must die''

 year old Gulsum Huseyin

 ''They bayonetted my  year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes''

Are these stories lies Have the eyewitnesses been daydreaming
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists too Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article TheyBritish reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists What is more here are the pictures Pictures
of people who were bayonetted whose eyes were gouged ears cut off

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these lies They are saying
exaggeration That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in  hours instead of  Or Gulsum Huseyin's
 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word

Some of the western press' led by some French Newspapers ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed So were the
French TV channels The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCEConference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe and rules all designed to fight against human
rights violations International reactions must be made with international
cooperation With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty Where
is the cooperation Where are the reactions And the intellectuals
journalists writers TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of human rights
Where are you

To All Muslim netters This is the same guy who gave a Fatwah that
Saudi Arabia can be used by the United Ststes to attack Iraq  

They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait
a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties
to Saudi citizens  And me thinks if the US had not helped out
the Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia too or at 
least the eastern oilfields  And no Muslim country was doing
much of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi
Arabia indeed in some masses of citizens were demonstrating
in favor of that butcher Saddam who killed lotsa Muslims
just because he was killing raping and looting relatively
rich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West

The whole saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia was nothing but US State
Department propeganda  Saddam and Iraq in general never recognised the 
British created Kuwait  They were trying to recover land they believed
was theirs much like the Argentines in the Faulklands  The Kuwaitis pushed
just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle
the dispute the old fashioned way
Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq
together and concentrated on taking out Saddam  A strong united Iraq with
an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of
the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf
But of course a weak divided Arab people better suits US foriegn policy

The US had no problem killing tens of thousands of illequipted Iraqi soldiers
including burying several thousand alive and slaughtering retreating batallions
from the air in defense of Kuwaiti oil but it has yet to lift a finger against
Bosnian Serbs while they slaughter Bosnian muslims

  I find it interesting that Mr Major finds the genocide of two
million Muslims in Bosnia acceptable   


Now you are actually claiming that  Muslims have been killed
in BH


        What if we remove one zeron and make it the genocide of two hundred
        thousands Muslims in Bosnia would that make it any better
        And how about the  Muslims who were driven and continue to
        be driven out of their homes is that utterly ridiculous claim
        And how about the rapes over  women and the concentration 
        camps The us delegation which visited them reported yesterday
        on CNN that the serbs are giving the muslims detainees  biscuits
        and a cup of water a day
        That sure also sounds like an utterly ridiculous claim

Please substantiate this utterly ridiculous claim

In article Maycoloradoedu perlmanqsoColoradoEDU Eric S Perlman writes

So far you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine I would
hardly take them as facts

Because you don't agree with them hmm

No because a fact and an opinion are two different things What you are 
expressing here are opinions not facts

In the abstract what you're saying is true  But the facts happen to
agree with me and disagree completely with you  

I could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue Spanish that
are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary Even more I
could show you a lot of meanings that words in Spanish have different
from those in the dictionary

We're talking about the latter not the former  And what you're talking
about is slang in the latter  That clearly has never been the case
here

No I am not talking about slang I am talking about different uses of the
same language in different places

Listen Pinkas  I'm going to count on the supposition that you think
through the opinions you have  something which is by the way against
my better judgment based on what I've seen from you to date  We are
agreed aren't we that dictionaries are reference books for the usage
of a given language and in particular for the meanings of the words and
phrases which comprise that language  Now you are using meanings
completely different from indeed in some cases diametrically different
from those given in the dictionary  As a reference book a dictionary
contains those meanings in both past and as much as it can in current
use  That's also why they are updated so often  Now if you are saying
things which you give different meanings than the dictionary does and
using nonstandard meanings about every word what is your chance of
being taken at face value

Just about none  Just about no one will take you that way because the
words mean something different to them  It's quite clear to me from
the response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is
happening  Ponder that


And guess why Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define 
in how many different ways the term Jew which is the basis of the movement 
itself

No probably because the question hasn't been asked  Gee I hate it
when people draw conclusions without information don't you

I hate people who cannot read I did not draw any conclusion I just 
said that it is curious considering how heterogeneous the movement is

What you did was ask a leading question  In English idiom the phrase
and guess why in the way you used it is a loaded question with
only one answer expected  

I also take offense at being told I cannot read by someone who is
obviously having trouble with the subject himself  Mr Pinkas I am a
PhD candidate in my field  One does not get to PhD candidacy if one
cannot read  


the Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and
not of cultural identity even if  of those defined as Jews in Isreal
are not religious

For the umpteenth time  it is NOT defined in terms of religion
This has been proven to you over and over again

No it has not The Law of Return defines a Jew as someone who has a 
Jewish mother and has not converted to another religion That is 
pretty the same as the religious definition



That IS a problem I am saying that I do not support Zionism as it is
now I believe that among the people in the Soviet Communist Party some
might even had been inspired by noble ideals Does that change the
final results of what happened in the USSR

Are you now wishing to compare the USSR and Israel  Or what  Israel
does not practice cruelty  

Now I understand You are unable to make abstractions You cannot 
get the idea from a text and you take everything literally
Bad thing

Balderdash  You know this is false  I would be able to make the
abstraction if it bore any resemblance to the facts of the matter
Yours did not  The analogy is utterly inapplicable

I wouldn't be in the field I'm in  astrophysics  if I couldn't make
abstractions and speculate about the general grand scheme of things  I
also wouldn't be in education  which I am and my students give me
rather good reviews I'd add  if I couldn't draw such analogies

About Israel not practicing cruelty ask those Palestinians in Israeli
prisons those who were tortured those whose houses had been blown 
by the Army

The vast majority of Palestinians in Israeli prisons aren't tortured
and their houses weren't blown up by the army  In fact you've seen me
protesting such measures ON THIS NET before  Are you now trying to
intimate my agreement with them

I never said it directly nor indirectly I am not talking about individuals
who defined themselves as zionists here I am sure most of them are good
honest and caring people I am talking about the results of the Zionist
Movement

In other words you are taking that as a monolith and ignoring the
dissension within it disagreement that is expressed freely and is
widely based  Just as bad

Can you read or are you just typing at random 

Do you know the meanings of the words you use or do you expect the
reader to read your mind  I can read just fine thank you  And I don't
need someone who is obviously having some troubles with a tongue which
isn't his native one telling me how to read the words in my own native
tongue  If it were Spanish I'd ask you  

I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a
Law of Return with a religious definition of Jew a country that defines
nationality based on religion

Then you're not talking about the movement as it exists today as I've
been trying to tell you  Please read the arguments I've given you  If
you can still say this after reading them you need to read them again





 I am talking about something I consider
a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief 
After all if Arabs in Israel cannot serve in the Army is becasue they 
were not born in the right religion

Arabs in Israel not only can but DO serve in the IDF  As you well
know

They can serve it is true but they are not allowed to do the all the
same things as the Israeli citizens who happen to be Jews

Yes they are  As you well know


OK fine  Now we know what you're talking about  But do you see my
point about how your words could easily have been taken differently 

It is not we it was you as in the second person in singular who cannot
understand a text if things are not explicitly said

Balderdash  See above  Once again you have a lot of gall and
absolutely no right to lecture a native speaker of a language who is
well educated in it in a language which isn't your own native tongue
and with which you're obviously having problems


So there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in Israel
Or what do you mean by Actually it doesn't

I mean exactly that  Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel have the same
rights

If there is no difference between them why keeping them in ID's
Better yet are you going to tell me that there are no differences in
social life between Arabs and Jews

Social life is one thing legal status is another  Once again this is
a leading question

So it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one That is what
I call a form of racism

No because the Jewish religion and culture are intimately inseparably
intertwined  If one renounces Judaism one renounces Judaism  

I do not believe that this is true

Final question  Is it possible to be both Jewish and Muslim  Jewish
and Christian  Your response will be enlightening

        I don't mean to sound disrespectful but since the majority
of the contributors and may be even readers of this newsgroup seem
to be muslims christians and jews my question could be of some 
interest to any of them
        It's my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay great
respect to an obscure st century jewish lad from JudeaGalilee Why 
they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery
to me personally I prefer Woody Allen  his stories are much juicier
 but perhaps it's an accident of history
        Anyway it seems that they may be talking about two different
jews According to the New Testament his father's name was Joseph
while in Qur'an he appears as Zachariah  
        Who's right and why the name difference I'm really curious

Ilyess sez 
  So how would have you defended Saudi Arabia and rolled 
  back the Iraqi invasion were you in charge of Saudi Arabia 
  
  All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq not 
  to Liberate Kuwait The people who were killed by the invasion are 
  more many many more than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis 
  in their smaller invasion I lived in the west and I have seen how 
  your media prepared you helpless naive Americans for a war against 
                                                     
No doubt you plan on exploiting helpless naive Americans for your own
purposes Hmmlet's see 

  Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that 
  led to the invasion as the CIA correctly predicted and pretended to 
  be surprised not to know 
  It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid 

  What would I have done Most Muslims would choose  dead Kuwaitis   over 
   dead Iraqis and  dead Kuwaitis The first case would happen 
  if no western intervention happened and the second case was a direct 
  or indirect result of western envolvement 

Possibly if  Iraqis had indeed died but this number is based on
Greenpeace estimates  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged
impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental
consequences of Allied miiltary action while initially completely
ignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes starting with the dumping
of millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of
over  oil wells  What is the real number  There has been a lot of
work on this in the last two years none of it reported as the
Greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about  The real
number seems to be around  on the same order as the number of
Kuwaitis killed tortured and kidnapped during the occupation  I've
included an article I recently posted below but this is really old
news  Independent Television News reported a figure around  only
a few months after the war but it was hardly reported 

For the Allies to have killed  Iraqis they would have had to
kill twice the total number of Iraqis in Kuwait 

The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at
Mutla'  This was yet another example of the American and European media
playing into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies     The
destruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an allout
slaughter  This is simply not true  The head and tail of the convoy
was bombed initially resulting in a lot of casualties at these points 
 Before bombers came back most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled
on foot 

Furthermore your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded
is completely ridiculous  You have acknowledged certainly implicitly 
 that Saddam is a barbarous brute  You have acknowledged the hundreds
of thousands he has been responible for killing in his own country 
You know that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait  Ali Majid
was his most brutal henchman presiding over the near genocide of the
Kurds  in the late 's and more recently the Shi'a    Yet when it
comes to his treatment of Kuwaitis he is an angel  In your estimate
he would've killed fewer than he already had when the war started 
What a joke 


APn     Iraq War Dead 

Copyright  The Associated Press All rights reserved 

By NICK LUDINGTON 
 Associated Press Writer 
   WASHINGTON AP  After the Persian Gulf War ended the world was
told that 
as many as  Iraqi soldiers were killed At one point even Baghdad put 
the toll that high as did the US Defense Intelligence Agency in private 
   But US officials have been backpedaling ever since even though the 
Pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public 
Now one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may
have been 
as low as  
   That conclusion by John Heidenrich writing in the current issue of the 
quarterly magazine Foreign Policy represents the lowest estimate yet
from US 
defense sources 
   The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of 
vastly moderated US military claims in the months after the war ended
Claims 
for a number of US weapons also were scaled down 
   Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking 
pictures of Iraq's disastrous retreat from Kuwait arguments have continued 
unabated about what really happened in the Gulf War 
   Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that 
originally were aired More that a year ago Air Force Lt Gen Charles
Horner 
the commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War said he believed the Iraqi 
military death toll was fewer than  for the entire war 
   The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of 
Iraqis who died in the day war against the USled coalition in
January and 
February  On Monday Pentagon spokesman Lt Cmdr Joe Gradisher
reiterated 
past statements that there just isn't a number that is credible 
   But some current internal estimates range from  to  Iraqi troops 
killed said one analyst speaking on condition of anonymity who is familiar 
with the Pentagon's reports 
   Allied deaths were put at  Americans  by friendly fire  British  
by American fire  Frenchmen  Italian and  among various Arab allies 
   Of the postwar reassessments the most widely publicized was the Army's 
reluctant acknowledgement months later that its touted Patriot air defense 
system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq's Scud missiles 
The Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the 
Patriot last spring it revised the hit ratio to  percent 
   The success record of the Navy's Tomahawk hightech cruise missile used 
against targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more 
modest than initially indicated by the Pentagon 
   The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a
May  
report by the environmental group Greenpeace which said  to  
Iraqi soldiers were killed It estimated that  to  Iraqi civilians 
were also killed 
   The same month published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency 
estimated  Iraqi soldiers were killed and  wounded in the
air and 
ground campaigns  although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate 
could be off by as much as  percent in either direction 
   But as more information became available those figures gradually were 
revised downward 
   The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated  dead and  
wounded after a review last year 
   But Heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign
Policy 
estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives
as low as 
  with about  wounded 
   Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of
bodies found 
and buried by US troops    and on prisoner of war interviews
He noted 
that only about  of  Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded 
   Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were 
captured he put the number of wounded at about  Using a conservative 
ratio of one dead to two wounded applicable to Third World armies like
Iraq he 
set battlefield deaths at  
   Maybe the figures are too low he wrote Maybe the real death toll
on the 
battlefield was  or  or even  Even then the evidence
suggests a 
death toll of well below   or even  
   In an interview he said the  figure was obviously off base
because it 
would mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of 
operations were casualties 
   He said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology 
but rather the drawnout conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia

  Excerpts from netnewstalkpoliticsmideast May Re Saudi
clergy   condemns d Robertc Moldenhauerpar  

  The whole saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia was nothing but US State 
  Department propeganda  Saddam and Iraq in general never recognised the 
  British created Kuwait  

This is complete garbage   It is Kuwait FAQ number  maintained but

Kuwait 

 

First is a note on the bogus arguments that the British 
drew the maps to deprive Iraq of Oil Then follows a 
chronology of events in Kuwait's history   Following 
the chronology is a speech by the Kuwaiti ambassador 
to the UN Following this is an article on the origins 
of Kuwait Following this is a series of articles 
which attest to the fact that Kuwait was independent of both 
nonexistent Iraq and the Ottoman Empire 

 

The Iraqi regime claims that Kuwait was cut from Iraq by the British 
in order to deprive Iraq of its oil The  and  border treaties 
between Kuwait and Iraq represent clear testimonies against such an 
allegation since oil was discovered in Kuwait in

From Kuwait Facts and Figures  

Shedding Some Light 

On September   the National Council on USArab Relations 
invited the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States Saud Nasser 
AlSabah The following are quotes of his speech 

Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before 
Iraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire Kuwait was in 
existence since  We continued to be in existence until the 
conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the 
area Thereafter we signed with the British in  a protective 
agreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security 
of Kuwait'' 

In  the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining 
without any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today Such an 
agreement was reconfirmed in  between the Kuwaiti government 
and the Iraqi government at that time That is when Iraq became a state 
after Kuwait itself'' 

In  when we declared our independence Iraq seized the 
opportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq There were threats The 
British came in and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty 
and territorial integrity of Kuwait In  Kuwait and Iraq again 
signed border agreement thereby defining our territory and Iraq's 
recognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait'' 

Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi 


Origins of Kuwait 

The establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b Ghurair of the 
Bani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence The beginning of 
Kuwait goes back to the late th century and some historians go 
further up to  Kuwait's name is derived from alKut which means 
fortress Kuwait is also called Qurain which is the diminutive of qarn a 
horn or hill Kuwait town flourished and grew since its 
establishment 

The 'Utub alSabah family is a branch of 'Utub settled in Kuwait 
during the early th century They lived under the protection 
of Bani Khalid until  After that they became independent and 
Sabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub 

Carsten Niebuhr  a Dutch explorer was among the first who 
wrote about the Arabia He was the mathematician in the scientific 
expedition sent in  by the King of Denmark to Arabia He 
documented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf 
and in the case of Kuwait he was the first writer to give the two 
names by which the town was known Kuwait and Qurain Niebuhr's chart 
of the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that 
century see the map from Abu Hakima History of Eastern Arabia 
 pub 

AlSabah 'Utub kept good relations with other powers in the eastern 
Arabia According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well 
documented study about the history of eastern Arabia between  
there was no Ottoman rule on the region In the second half of 
the th century there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia 
In fact Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged Their 
attempts to restore their lost position in alHasa through the 
campaign of Thuwayni in  and Ali Pasha's expedition against the 
Wahhabis in  were unsuccessful At Kuwait the nearest point of 
the Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra the Shaikh 
was under no form of Ottoman control The aim of 'Utbi external policy 
was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the 
Gulf'' p  Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that Kuwait 
was not a dependency of Basra the Persian occupation of Basra 
 did not affect Kuwait'' p 

Kuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab 
world This identity was clear to the British and the French who 
tried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between  when the 
British wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the 
Gulf area 

 

Independent Kuwait 

This is the first of a series of articles that testify to the 
independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the 
Ottomans 

The following text is related to an expedition carried out by the 
Ottomans in  against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia where the oil fields 
in Saudi Arabia now Kuwait and its ruler at that time Sheikh 
Abdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir allied themselves with the Turks 

Abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one He joined the 
expedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first 
to use its guns against the besieged town of AlQatif Had it not been 
for this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet AlQatif obviously would 
not have surrendered in a mere three hours 

In relation to this a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships 
refrained from participating in the bombardment The answer lies in 
reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of 
the progress of the expedition Because the Ottomans were unwilling to 
jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area  the 
Sultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the 
war against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone Kuwait which was not 
a party  to the abovementioned treaty of  was under no such 
obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against 
those who had signed it 


 From the above text we can see that Kuwait was not part of the 
Ottomans or the British colonies For more details about the mentioned 
expedition please check out the source of the above text

Independent Kuwait 

This is another article of a series of articles that testify to the 
independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the 
Ottomans 

The following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair 
Iraq between the Sheikh of Kuwait and AlZuhair tribe in Zubair 

In  trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the 
estate which was purchased by his father Sheikh Jabir in  This 
property was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam representative on 
the basis of a claim by the AlZuhair that the vendor had been the 
owner of a share and not of the n e Sufiyya At the same time 
Sheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at 
the island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian 
territory 

It should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start 
showed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants Abdulla Ibn 
Sabah  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his 
father's agent in the case  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail 
upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven 
years produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were 
entitled to receive 

Eventually the dispute was settled by the Wali Governor of Baghdad 
in favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait The decision of the Governor of 
Basra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons 
Some writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the 
Turkish side and suggest that the Governor Namiq Pasha even offered 
him the title of Qa'immaqam which he declined Nevertheless  the 
proceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants 
of Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair It seems 
that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the 
British Agent at Basra the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to 
abandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule Lorimer suggests 
that the final order of Namiq Pasha upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's 
title to Sufiyya was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah 
with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go 
against him had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support 
from the Wahhabi Amir'' 

In addition to this legal matter with Zubair Kuwait had had other 
problems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah as 
explained above However Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman 
mutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several 
instances those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when 
pressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them

Independent Kuwait 

This is another article that testifies to the 
independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the 
Ottomans 


When Pelly Colonel Pelly the British Resident in the Gulf visited Kuwait 
for the first time on March   he was 
met at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak the second son of the ruler Sheikh 
Sabah Just before he reached Kuwait town on March  he was met by 
Sheikh Abdulla the eldest son and heir apparent who accompanied him 
to the town gate on their way to a very good home'' which had been 
prepared for Pelly and his companions Scarcely had we entered it'' 
says Pelly when Sheikh Sabah himself came'' 
This description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain 
degree it was run according to protocol 

The government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the 
subject of comments made by Pelly The Government is patriarchal'' 
says Pelly the Sheikh managing the political and the Cazee Qadi 
the judicial departments The Sheikh himself would submit to the 
Cazee's decision'' Punishment was rarely inflicted Indeed there 
seems little government interference anywhere and little need of an 
army'' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the 
country retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him 

When my father was nearly  years old he called me and said I 
shall soon die I have made no fortune and can leave you no money 
but I have made many and true friends grapple them While other 
states around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or 
illgovernment mine has gone on flourishing Hold to my policy and 
though you are surrounded by  desert and pressed by a once hostile 
and still wandering set of tribes you will prosper''

Independent Kuwait 

This is another article that testifies to the 
independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the 
Ottomans 


The British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a good friend'' but 
in October  an event took place at Kuwait which could have 
weakened those good relations On October  Lieutenant Edmunds the 
Assistant Resident at Abu Shahr in Iran arrived in Kuwait on  a 
special mission from the Resident Captain Hennell His mission was to 
find out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a 
British line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the 
Mediterranean The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor 
of the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay The 
salute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three 
days before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh 

After Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr both he and Captain Hennell 
explained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh to have been due not 
to illwill but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent 
at Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British 
Therefore they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any 
change in his friendly policies towards the British 

If the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds so 
also did the Egyptians Earlier in the same year some of the most 
wanted men in the Wahhabi camp such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan the 
Wahhabi general  in AlHasa and Wahhabi tribes like AlDuwaish 
sought refuge in Kuwait 

Protection of refugees seeking political 
asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by 
Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah This can therefore be looked upon as an 
indication of selfconfidence an outcome of Kuwait's independence 
from foreign powers It corroborates the fact that Kuwait if 
necessary was prepared to defend itself against more powerful 
neighbors 

This defense depended not only on the walls of the city but also on 
bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with 
the necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time 

As to Kuwait's position between  and  one can safely state 
that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the 
struggling Wahhabis and Egyptians Relations with the British  and 
even with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms

  They were trying to recover land they believed 
  was theirs much like the Argentines in the Faulklands  The Kuwaitis pushed 
  just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle 
  the dispute the old fashioned way 

Are you really this cartoonish  Or do you seriously believe this  If
so please post  your proof 

  Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq 
  together and concentrated on taking out Saddam  A strong united Iraq with 
  an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of 
  the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf 

Are standards at UWisc dropping  Since when has Iraq ever had an
elected government

         to defend oneself to fight brutal occupation and to restore the
         freedom of oneself or one's people Not just in Islam but also

What is so honorable about placing bombs in passenger airliners
promising to execute Rushdie killing  million people in the

Egypt massacring Christians in Sudan harassing Christians in and 
barring Jews from Saudi Arabia  How are paranoid Muslims righteous

Palestine was a name given to that same area after the Jews already
had their own governments there for a very long time  Palestinean
nationality is a recent political invention no more than a few
decades old  This is what the Jew Jake says to that

This may be true but I think we Jews dismiss Palestinian nationalism at our
peril  Its newness doesn't obviate its reality

Besides Israeli nationalism is a new phenomenum as well

Israeli nationalism also known as Zionism is the nationalism of the
Jewish people  The Jewish people are not a new phenomenon at all

Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arab people  Arabs have
been around for a long time  They already  have some  dozen states
large and small covering  of the Middle East

More specifically Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arabs
from the region of Palestine just as Egyptian nationalism is the
nationalism of Arabs from the region of Egypt  One Palestinean state
already exists in what was once known as Palestine  it is called
Jordan 

There is no justification in carving out a second and tiny Palestinean
state out of the only Jewish state itself very very small just as
there is no justification in carving out another American state out of
Mexico

The Arab Association for Human Rights HRA was 
formed in  to address discriminatory practices and 
human rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian 
citizens

It is a unique association concerned with the civil 
political economic social and cultural rights of the 
Palestinian national minority in Israel Among the issues 
of concern are land confiscation education prison 
conditions unemployment torture and the unequal 
allocation of Israel's resources

Today there are around  Palestinian Arabs living 
within the Green line the pre borders of Israel 
constituting  of Israel's citizens For them it is an 
empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the 
needs of the Jewish population Legally and practically 
Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early 
promises of equality for nonJewish citizens have not 
been fulfilled This is apparent in many areas strongly 
affecting the Palestinian national minority

Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since 
 The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does 
not receive a fair share of state resources On a dayto
day level Palestinians face discrimination in many 
different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission 
to build a house start a business find a job or educate 
their children

ACTIVITIES

 Monitoring civil economic cultural and human rights 
abuses of Palestinians within the Green Line
 Taking carefully selected test cases to court
 Providing legal advice and assistance to lawyers in the 
Occupied Territories
 Educating the Palestinian public as to their rights and 
methods of mobilization
 Conducting public campaigns on local and international 
levels
 Researching and publishing pertinent publications

    for Arab armies to attack Israel on Yom Kippur  I suppose it
    is brave to slaughter athletes at the Olympics  Or maybe you

Armenians have been doing just that for a long long time

Source Hagop Hagopian said to have been part of  Terror Attack at
Munich Olympic Games The Armenian Reporter February   p 

Le Matin the influential Paris daily based on unidentified sources
claimed last week that Hagop Hagopian the founder and leader of one
faction of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia ASALA
was among the Arab terrorists who staged an attack on the living quarters
of Israeli athletes at the  Olympic Games

Le Matin added that up to  Hagopian operated out of Beirut Lebanon
but escaped from the country when Israeli forces entered the city It was
about this time that a statement issued by ASALA claimed that Mr Hagopian
was dead of wounds suffered during a bombing by the Israeli Air Force
although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and
well and presently is residing alternately in Damascus Syria and
Athens Greece The paper also noted that the socialist government of
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his PASOK party accepted the
Armenian underground leader with open arms and still providing him
with assistance simply because of Greece's traditional enmity with Turkey

Le Matin further adds that ASALA derives only a small portion of its
expenditures from wealthy Armenians who support the cause with the rest 
coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in
drug trafficking

You gave a good reference please who was the author of Plymouth 
Plantation You could have given more on the travel accounts

Radiating from someone who is incapable of providing a single scholarly
source on his 'genocide apology program' it is rather amusing Again
where is your nonexistent list of scholars and scholarly sources
Here is mine

An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the
 systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of 
 the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at 
 least  percent of the population of that republic The 
 memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and 
 eyewitnessed these atrocities was published in the US in
  with the title 'Men Are Like That' Other references abound
     Rachel A Bortnick  The Jewish Times  June  


 In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul
  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us
  create for ourselves It certainly is possible to severe the artificial
  lifesupport system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us
  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats 
  in this alien land
            Sahak Melkonian    Preserving the Armenian purity 


 The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination 
  of the Muslim population in Soviet Republic of Armenia Karabag 
  Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the 
  extermination of  million Muslims by the Armenian Government 
  during the WWI and of over  million European Jews during the WWII
                  Tovfik Kasimov  Azeri Leader  September  
                 

 Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against
  Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia as well as the Soviet Republic
  of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan
  are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide 
  perpetrated by the Armenian Government  years ago against the
  Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these
  lands         Cebbar Leygara  Kurdish Leader  October

I got some email on this topic and decided to do some more reading I
thought it would be nice to share my response with everyone

How about the following scholarly source

Source Pierre Oberling The Road to Bellapais The Turkish Cypriot
        Exodus to Northern Cyprus Social Science Monographs Boulder
         ISBN 

Well according to a book by CMWoodhouse I've read it looks like the
situation was much more complicated than either of us suggest Needless
to say nationalism on both the Greek and Turkish side was strong and
began in April of ' with confrontations over the Agean as usual
between the government in Turkey and the Ioannidis junta
In July  an assasination attempt against Makarios then president of
Cyprus plotted by Ioannidis ruling dictator in Greece fails and
Makarios flees to England The journalist Nicos Sampson takes over in a
coup led by the Greek officers in the Cyprus National Guard Turkish
forces which had been mobilized in anticipation begin landing on the
north shore of the island on th of July This caused the welcomed
collapse of the dictatorship the th with Mr Karamanlis returning from

Well I am forced to disagree with you The Greeks started massacring 
the Turkish population on Cyprus in  In  Turkiye stepped into 
Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there This is 
nothing but a simple historical fact Unfortunately the intervention 
was too late at least for some of the victims Mass graves containing 
numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been 
planned for a peaceful minority

The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots 
will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain 
eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece someday whatever the 
cost to the parties involved The history speaks for itself Greece was 
the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops 
on July   in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of 
Archibishop Makarios

The release of Nikos Sampson a member of EOKA National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters and a convicted terrorist shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece Of
course the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences 
for this irresponsible conduct

Turkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a
repeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA If 
such assurances are not perfectly implemented there is every reason 
to expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate 
their past mistakes On such an occasion the Turkish side may not find 
it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before 
for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical 
vicious attacks Therefore it would be better to have a true federation
of two separate sections living in obligatory peace rather than another 
armed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily 
but decisively terminated by the Turks 

The present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population 
in western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights which 
were established through international treaties One might be better
advised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve 
Greece well

An offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions 
that may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for 
Greece or her friends Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been 
placed on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain

   Earlier the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon
a special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt But the deputy for
the Parliament Rahimzade doesn't consider that the deputates have the 
objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power It concerns the
serious analysis of the social economic and foreign policy activity of the
republic's authority Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament
ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion
on these questions
   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan  deputates was dissolved one year ago
when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power

   Baku May  Turan Deputy primeministers of the republic Vahid
Ahmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS
common economic zone
   Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a 
common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic 
According to Abbas Abbasov the pact of cooperation proposals submitted for
the discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May  has a number
of unfavorable points for Azerbaijan
   Such announcements of two deputy primeministers sound sensational on the
background of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of
the Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic
zone


THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW

     Baku May  Turan Today Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director

insistence of the Armenian side We do not intend to come back to the analysis
of the schedule because we have given a positive answer to it on May  said
Gasimov
     The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just
began to work on the examination of the commentary and their answer would be 
given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 
     As it is known the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by
Armenia which put forward a number of preconditions for its acceptance


THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU MAY  TURAN The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced
that the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the  Russian soldiers 
condemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court as innocent
people is unjustified
    Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves
prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units
and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit where they
served
    The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers
as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also 
unfounded For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the
list of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan
   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of
the Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the
Russian community Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows that this
type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated

in the war against Azerbaijan

documents of this organization Admitting the nonrealizability of reunion of
the North Caucasus and Armenia proper at present the front is appealing to 
the UN presidents of Russia Armenia and the United States to consider the
need to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus
     To attain these goals the Armenian organization considers it necessary to

ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS

     BAKU MAY  TURAN After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on 
six Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh
Armenian propaganda has become actively involved
     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin
with a request to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian
soldiers At the same time Armenian mass media call legal proceedings
on the case in Baku as a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia
     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently If one could
believe the Yerevan agency Snark the Armenians in Karabakh presented
an ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan The essence of this ultimatum
is that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy three Azeri prisoners in
Karabakh will be shot dead
     It is simple to explain such touching attitude of Armenians to
the six Russian soldiers' fate If by chance the sentence is executed
it will cause not antiAzeri but antiArmenian reaction as the accused
Russian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister
of Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh
     If the soldiers get mercy Armenian side will think highly of its
saving of lives of innocent Russians O

     BAKU MAY  TURAN Lately at the black market of Baku the
national currency  Manat fell in price compared with the Russian

respect to Ruble which is  the national currency fell in value
 percent Meanwhile the exchangevalue of the Manat to the Ruble is

operations in Russia As the remittance of payments from the republics

arrange deals in cash Taking into consideration the volume of business 
with Russia counted by billions it is not hard to imagine how much

the representatives of Azerbaijan At the same talk he declared that in case
the peace process deadlocked Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself
     Such statement from the Russian diplomat who is one of the authors
of the Trilateral initiative suggests that the Russian leadership is
paving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from
the peacemaking process This statement can also mean that Russia and
US having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem have agreed on partial
US departure from Transcaucasia


FATE OF  MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER

   Baku May  Turan The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company
Sabit Bagirov declared recently that complete treaty on development of

Source 'International Economics Theory and Policy' by Paul R
        Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld Harper Collins Publishers
         second edition

In terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to 
Purchasing Power Parity' Greece is in the same category with 
Turkiye


Indeed Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle The 
economy is in shambles corruption is rampant air pollution is 
in outrageous dimensions statesponsored terrorism is the name 
of the game and infrastructure is decaying Another insightful 
article in the New York Times Sunday April  exposes the dirty 
linen of Greece and describes her as the pariah of the European 
Community The article reports that ''with unEuropean antics
Greece uses the Community as a cash register She squanders and
at times even steals the European tax payers' money for political  
featherbedding at home The principal members of the Community
admit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European
Community'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that
notwithstanding her geographic location Greece is unEuropean
in mentality and attitude 

Indeed during the last  years Turkiye registered a great 
success with regard to economic restructuring A sound economy 
ready to be integrated to the world economies has emerged 
succeeding to the faltering one witnessed in the 's

Just  years ago Greece used to export double as much as 
Turkiye did Now inversely Turkiye's overall exports exceed 
by far that of Greece As far as the tourism incomes are 
concerned we are witnessing the same phenomenon

The governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on 
the infrastructure investments rather than investing in
world terrorist organizations thereby solving this issue 
completely Indeed in the 's it was out of the question 
to conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West 
Nowadays this is not the case at all and in a far remote 
town even in a village you may have at any time a longdistance 
call to any given country

However the same could not be applied to Greece In fact
it is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany
round the clock And if you happen to be in the Greek islands
then your chance will be pretty slim Therefore it would not
be an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of 
Greece in regard to telecommunication facilities Greece
by virtue of its full membership has enjoyed all advantages
of the EC obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies 
Turkiye having no access at all to similar financial supports
has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which 
enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus
over the last two years As such Turkiye deserves to be the
only country in its region having permanent current accounts
surplus

   I  must  finally  admit the total truth that is central to the
core of my being

   I  am  a  homosexual   Not  just  a  normal  runofthemill
homosexual  but  a  rabid homosexual Zionist  I hide behind the
facade  of  proIsrael  rhetoric so as to deflect suspicion of my
true  motive  the exchange of romantic dialogue with Nick Steel
and  our  frequent  fudgepacking   adventures  which   we  have
endeavored  to maintain at a discreet level  Of course the need
for discretion has been obviated by my own admission here

   The  truth  is  that  I  could  no longer hold this saccharine
secret  any  longer   I love  you  Nick  and  my  love for you
surpasses  that  which  I  hold  for Eretz Yisrael may she stand
forever as our love has and as your erection insinuating itself
into my kosher rectum always will

I caught the tail end of a piece on NPR National Public Radio about
Chomsky  Apparently there is a new documentary about him and his
concepts on the propagandist news media of the West or some such
The funny thing is that NPR painted Chomsky and the documentary in
such a positive light or at least ended the report in a positive way
The documentary is just now showing in a few cities in the US and
will open in more cities in June  Sorry forgot the title

                     SDPA urartuUUCP

So you stand by the statement that all Armenians are barbarians  OK I see   
Lets not even act as if there is a chance they are human  See Serdar when you  
judge people because of their race this is called racism  I tend to frown on  
this sort of thing  Obviously you don't  When you label an entire race the  
way you do it is easy to stop thinking of them as human beings and this can  
make GENOCIDE possible  But I guess and this is where Serdar will fill the  
page with quotes taken out of context you know that huh

FascistNAZIbarbarianfill in the blank with any catch all bad term

 It is public knowledge that 
 Hagopian began his notorious career as a member of the terrorist 
 group which perpetrated the massacre of the Israeli athletes at the
 Munich Olympics in 

Public knowlege  I was not aware of that  NOW I see the ARMENIANS decide to  
kill the Israeli athletes in  as PRACTICE  I was confused but thanks for  
clearing that up
 And the 'Armenian Foundation' stole from the 
 children of Turkiye to fund the criminal activities of the ASALASDPAARF
 terrorists in their coldblooded murder of defenceless Turkish and
 Kurdish people 

Wow you are on a roll with the accusations today Serdar so how did the  
Armenians steal from the Turkish children  Was it their lunch money  This is  
very cute how you inserted children in this fill in the blank accusation sheet  
you fill out every day  It really touches my heart  Oh and thank you for  
letting me know that Kurds and Armenians hate each other  I was not aware of  
this  The only time I have ever talked about Kurds it was about the WONDERFUL  
treatment they were recieving in Turkey  They must have a high incedence of  
insanity because there sure are a lot of them fighting against the  
nonoppresive Turkish government that has let their culture flower over the  
past  years

 THE ARMENIAN FOUNDATION PROVIDED  BILLION TL TO ASALA
 
      MILLIYET The Armenian Foundation based in
 Istanbul is found to have provided  billion Turkish Lira 
 million to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which have
 murdered several Turkish diplomats abroad 

Thanks for the unbiased TURKISH MEDIA SOURCE  I am sure the Milliyet is rated  
number one for accuracy and truth

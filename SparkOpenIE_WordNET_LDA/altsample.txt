PHILIP K DICK

Philip K Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thoughtprovoking short 
stories and novels  His stories are bizarre at times but very approachable
He wrote mainly SF but he wrote about people truth and religion rather than
technology  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God he
remained sceptical  Amongst his novels the following are of some relevance

Galactic PotHealer
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans  When the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers pothealer Joe Fernwright is
unable to comply  A polished ironic and amusing novel

A Maze of Death
Noteworthy for its description of a technologybased religion

Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters

another star system  Unfortunately she is terminally ill and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to hour easy listening music

MARGARET ATWOOD

The Handmaid's Tale
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously
assassinated and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
right again  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new Christian theocracy  Women's right to own property is revoked
and their bank accounts are closed sinful luxuries are outlawed and the
radio is only used for readings from the Bible  Crimes are punished
retroactively doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are
hunted down and hanged  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on

RICHARD SWINBURNE

The Existence of God Revised Edition Clarendon Paperbacks Oxford
This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with The Coherence of
Theism  and was concluded with Faith and Reason   In this
work Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of God  His arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late th century western Christian values and
aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were
decisively rejected in Mackie's The Miracle of Theism  In the revised
edition of The Existence of God Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie

J L MACKIE

The Miracle of Theism Oxford
This posthumous volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of God  It ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of Descartes Anselm Berkeley Hume et al through
the moral arguments of Newman Kant and Sidgwick to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne  It also addresses those
positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational
such as those of Kierkegaard Kung and Philips as well as replacements for
God such as Lelie's axiarchism  The book is a delight to read  less
formalistic and better written than Martin's works and refreshingly direct
when compared with the handwaving of Swinburne

                          An Introduction to Atheism
                       by mathew mathewmantiscouk

This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism  Whilst I
have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you
should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint  I
would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some
relevant books are listed in a companion article

To provide a sense of cohesion and progression I have presented this article
as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist  All the
questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped
up repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created  Some other
frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article

Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions
posed from a Christian viewpoint  This is because the FAQ files reflect
questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly Christians
who proselytize on altatheism

So when I talk of religion I am talking primarily about religions such as
Christianity Judaism and Islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine
being  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it
may not

What is atheism

Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God
Some atheists go further and believe that God does not exist  The former is
often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong
atheism

It is important to note the difference between these two positions  Weak
atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of God  Strong
atheism is a positive belief that God does not exist  Please do not
fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists

Some atheists believe in the nonexistence of all Gods others limit their
atheism to specific Gods such as the Christian God rather than making
flatout denials

But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist

Definitely not  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe
it to be true  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to
believing that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true or
not  Which brings us to agnosticism

What is agnosticism then

The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the
Metaphysical Society in   He defined an agnostic as someone who
disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things
must be some cause unknown and unknowable

Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for
sure whether God exists

Words are slippery things and language is inexact  Beware of assuming that
you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact
that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic  For example many people
use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when
referring to strong atheism

Beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning it
is very difficult to generalize about atheists  About all you can say for
sure is that atheists don't believe in God  For example it certainly isn't
the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out
about the universe

So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism

There are many philosophical justifications for atheism  To find out why a
particular person chooses to be an atheist it's best to ask her

Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions
is essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible that
such a God could exist  Others are atheists through scepticism because they
see no evidence that God exists

But isn't it impossible to prove the nonexistence of something

There are many counterexamples to such a statement  For example it is
quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than
all other prime numbers  Of course this deals with welldefined objects
obeying welldefined rules  Whether Gods or universes are similarly
welldefined is a matter for debate

However assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably
impossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence of
God  If we assume that something does not exist it is always possible to
show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexample

If on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing in
question is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalid
may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing
might be found to show that it isn't there  Such an exhaustive search is
often impractical or impossible  There is no such problem with largest
primes because we can prove that they don't exist

Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist
unless we have evidence that they do  Even theists follow this rule most of
the time they don't believe in unicorns even though they can't conclusively
prove that no unicorns exist anywhere

To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be
tested  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to
prove that he doesn't exist anywhere  So the sceptical atheist assumes by
default that God does not exist since that is an assumption we can test

Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God
exists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to cover
varieties of God described by followers of various religions  So whilst it
may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists it may be
possible to prove that say a God as described by a particular religious
book does not exist  It may even be possible to prove that no God described
by any presentday religion exists

In practice believing that no God described by any religion exists is very
close to believing that no God exists  However it is sufficiently different
that counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of
God are not really applicable

But what if God is essentially nondetectable

If God interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interaction
must be measurable  Hence his interaction with our universe must be
detectable

If God is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that he
does not interact with our universe in any way  Many atheists would argue
that if God does not interact with our universe at all it is of no
importance whether he exists or not

If the Bible is to be believed God was easily detectable by the Israelites
Surely he should still be detectable today

Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically
verifiable physical way  It must surely be possible to perceive some
effect caused by his presence though otherwise how can I distinguish him
from all the other things that don't exist

OK you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism but
 isn't it still a religious belief

One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the
redefinition game  The cynical view of this game is as follows

Person A begins by making a contentious statement  When person B points out
that it can't be true person A gradually redefines the words he used in the
statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept  He
then records the statement along with the fact that person B has agreed to
it and continues  Eventually A uses the statement as an agreed fact but
uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure
redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it  Rather than be seen
to be apparently inconsistent B will tend to play along

The point of this digression is that the answer to the question Isn't
atheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant by
religious  Religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman
controlling power  especially in some sort of God  and by faith and
worship

 It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not
  religion according to such a definition 

Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is it
categorized by worship in any meaningful sense  Widening the definition of
religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of
human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well  such as
science politics and watching TV

OK so it's not a religion  But surely belief in atheism or science is
 still just an act of faith like religion is

Firstly it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one
actually believes in

Secondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to
make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience  Most atheists
try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject to
questioning if experience throws them into doubt

Science has a number of core assumptions  For example it is generally
assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers  These are
the sort of core assumptions atheists make  If such basic ideas are called
acts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based on
acts of faith and the term loses its meaning

Faith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in something
According to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts of
faith  Of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as
religious followers when claiming that something is certain  This is not a
general tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant to
state with certainty that the universe exists

Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof
Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition as sceptical atheism
has no beliefs  Strong atheism is closer but still doesn't really match as
even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or
the lack of it when asserting that God does not exist

If atheism is not religious surely it's antireligious

It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or
against friend or enemy  The truth is not so clearcut

Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that sense
it can be said to be antireligion  However when religious believers
speak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheists
have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists

This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair
Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum

Most atheists take a live and let live attitude  Unless questioned they
will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends  Of
course this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in
many countries

A few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert others
when possible  Historically such antireligious atheists have made little
impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries

To digress slightly the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation
of church and state just like the USA  Soviet citizens were legally free to
worship as they wished  The institution of state atheism came about when
Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in
order to gain complete power over the population

Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they see
religion encroaching on matters which are not its business  for example
the government of the USA  Such individuals are usually concerned that
church and state should remain separate

But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state
 surely that's the same as state atheism

The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall
not legislate concerning matters of religious belief  In particular it
means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of
another but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in
nature

Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters  For
example religious believers have historically been responsible for
encouraging many political reforms  Even today many organizations
campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as
religious campaigns  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters
and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheists
are quite happy to see them have their say

What about prayer in schools If there's no God why do you care if people
 pray

Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do things
that those who don't pray can't just ignore  Also Christian prayer in
schools is intimidating to nonChristians even if they are told that they
need not join in  The diversity of religious and nonreligious belief means
that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be
acceptable to all those present at any public event

Also nonprayers tend to have friends and family who pray  It is reasonable
to care about friends and family wasting their time even without other
motives

You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid  What about
 atheists  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals  Don't
 atheists object to the religious charities

There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can
contribute to  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well for
the sake of the practical good they do  Some atheists even do voluntary work
for charities founded on a theistic basis

Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in
connection with charity  To them atheism is just a simple obvious everyday
matter and so is charity  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap not to say
selfrighteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set
of religious beliefs

To weak atheists building a hospital to say I do not believe in God is a
rather strange idea it's rather like holding a party to say Today is not my
birthday  Why the fuss  Atheism is rarely evangelical

You said atheism isn't antireligious  But is it perhaps a backlash against
 one's upbringing a way of rebelling

Perhaps it is for some  But many people have parents who do not attempt to
force any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those people
choose to call themselves atheists

It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a
backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different  On the
other hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the
expectations of others

On the whole we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are
backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go
along with a group rather than act or think independently

How do atheists differ from religious people

They don't believe in God  That's all there is to it

Atheists may listen to heavy metal  backwards even  or they may prefer a
Verdi Requiem even if they know the words  They may wear Hawaiian shirts
they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes  Many
Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God  Some atheists even carry a copy
of the Bible around  for arguing against of course

Whoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists without
realising it  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and
appearance

Unexceptional But aren't atheists less moral than religious people

That depends  If you define morality as obedience to God then of course
atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God  But usually when one
talks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptable
wrong behaviour within society

Humans are social animals and to be maximally successful they must
cooperate with each other  This is a good enough reason to discourage most
atheists from antisocial or immoral behaviour purely for the purposes
of selfpreservation

Many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they
feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans  So why do they care
what happens to others  They don't know they simply are that way

Naturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to use
atheism to justify their actions  However there are equally many people who
behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their
actions  For example

  Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance Jesus Christ
   came into the world to save sinners  But for that very reason I was
   shown mercy so that in me  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited
   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive
   eternal life  Now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only God
   be honor and glory forever and ever

The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February th 
by Jeffrey Dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee
Wisconsin  It seems that for every atheist massmurderer there is a
religious massmurderer  But what of more trivial morality

   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior
   deteriorated after born again experiences  While only  of respondents
   said they had driven intoxicated before being born again  had done
   so after conversion  Similarly  had used illegal drugs before
   conversion  after  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex
   before salvation  after
                                Freethought Today September  p 

So it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moral
behaviour

Is there such a thing as atheist morality

If you mean Is there such a thing as morality for atheists then the
answer is yes as explained above  Many atheists have ideas about morality
which are at least as strong as those held by religious people

If you mean Does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer
is no  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person
will behave  Most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists
but for different reasons  Atheists view morality as something created by
humans according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work rather
than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being

Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God

A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over  of the
atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for
them  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible
with what they observed around them

Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they are
unbelievers through choice  The vast majority of them have spent time
studying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth  They have
made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs

This decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that
individual's personality  For a naturally sceptical person the choice
of atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the only
choice that person can honestly make

But don't atheists want to believe in God

Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them  Many
of them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured the
Big Brother figure might be

Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God  but so what Should
one believe things merely because one wants them to be true  The risks of
such an approach should be obvious  Atheists often decide that wanting to
believe something is not enough there must be evidence for the belief

But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God  they are
 unwilling in their souls to see

Many if not most atheists were previously religious  As has been explained
above the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God
exists  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God

Of course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming that
all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedminded
Comments such as Of course God is there you just aren't looking properly
are likely to be viewed as patronizing

Certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is
vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are
being sincere if they say that they have searched for God  If you are not
willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate is
futile

Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist

Many atheists live a purposeful life  They decide what they think gives
meaning to life and they pursue those goals  They try to make their lives
count not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on other
people who will live on  For example an atheist may dedicate his life to
political reform in the hope of leaving his mark on history

It is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random
events  However it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing
that has a meaning

To put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actually
a sensible thing to ask  Some atheists believe that asking What is the
meaning of life is as silly as asking What is the meaning of a cup of
coffee  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just is

So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger

There are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even pets
Or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or TV

That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so
what  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting or
should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be

In the end it's a decision for the individual concerned  Most atheists are
unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because
it makes them feel comfortable  They put truth before comfort and consider
that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy that's just
hard luck

Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong

The short answer is No do you

Many atheists have been atheists for years  They have encountered many
arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God but they have
found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive

Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of
the existence of God  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely
to be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about it

So why should theists question their beliefs Don't the same arguments
 apply

No because the beliefs being questioned are not similar  Weak atheism is
the sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing  Strong atheism
is a negative belief  Theism is a very strong positive belief

Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs
because of the very real harm they can cause  not just to the believers
but to everyone else

What sort of harm

Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind  It's not
just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings
think of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so on
Imagine how that effort could be better spent

Many theists believe in miracle healing  There have been plenty of instances
of ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicines
prescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result  Some theists have died
because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds

It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control  and
condoms in particular  is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many
thirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS worldwide

Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than
allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different
religion

Those weren't REAL believers  They just claimed to be believers as some
 sort of excuse

What makes a real believer  There are so many One True Religions it's hard
to tell  Look at Christianity there are many competing groups all
convinced that they are the only true Christians  Sometimes they even fight
and kill each other  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL
Christian and who isn't when even the major Christian churches like the
Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves

In the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who
calls himself a Christian and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his
actions should be considered a Christian  Maybe some of those Christians
are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends  but surely if
the Bible can be so readily used to support unChristian acts it can't be
much of a moral code If the Bible is the word of God why couldn't he have
made it less easy to misinterpret And how do you know that your beliefs
aren't a perversion of what your God intended

If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible then why
should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your sayso
Sorry but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered
others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so we must call him a
Christian

Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned  But since
 nobody has ever proved that God does not exist it must be very unlikely
 that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsense

That does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue
positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much
harder to disprove than negative ones  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns
don't exist but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths

It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than
it is to hold a positive assertion by default  Of course weak atheists
would argue that asserting nothing is better still

Well if atheism's so great why are there so many theists

Unfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct
it is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrology
graphology and other pseudosciences

Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in
gods  Certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows the
people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand

Of course there's more to religion than that  In the industrialized world
we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when
there are perfectly adequate natural explanations  Religion may have started
as a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves other
purposes as well

But so many cultures have developed religions  Surely that must say
 something

Not really  Most religions are only superficially similar for example it's
worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of
concept of God in the Christian sense

Of course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so it's
rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another

What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded
 that God exists

For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one who
does not  Besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief is
not determined by how many people believe it  Also it is important to
realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the
same way that theists view their religious leaders

A famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields but
when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight  Many
respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on
subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise

So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates
 nothing

Not entirely  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has
properties which have helped it so spread so far

The theory of memetics talks of memes  sets of ideas which can propagate
themselves between human minds by analogy with genes  Some atheists view
religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread by
encouraging their hosts to convert others  Some memes avoid destruction by
discouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressure
to keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken  Some
religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by
other memes

Of course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with
successful propagation of a meme  Religion is not a good thing because of
the number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thing
because of the number of people who have caught it

Even if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important
 messages  What are the fundamental messages of atheism

There are many important ideas atheists promote  The following are just a
few of them don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some
religions

   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules

   Be especially sceptical of positive claims

   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning it's up to you to
   find it

   Search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable

   Make the most of your life as it's probably the only one you'll have

   It's no good relying on some external power to change you you must change
   yourself

   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good

   If you must assume something assume something it's easy to test

   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true

and finally and most importantly

   All beliefs should be open to question

Well John has a quite different not necessarily more elaborated theology
There is some evidence that he must have known Luke and that the content
of Q was known to him but not in a 'canonized' form

This is a new argument to me  Could you elaborate a little

 
The argument goes as follows Qoid quotes appear in John but not in
the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke However they are
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such and
not an entirely different source
 
 
Assuming that he knew Luke would obviously put him after Luke and would
give evidence for the latter assumption

I don't think this follows  If you take the most traditional attributions
then Luke might have known John but John is an elder figure in either case
We're talking spans of time here which are well within the range of
lifetimes
 
We are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors The usual
explanation for the time order of Mark Matthew and Luke does not consider
their respective ages It says Matthew has read the text of Mark and Luke
that of Matthew and probably that of Mark
 
As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text The evidence
for that is not overwhelming admittedly
 
 
  Earlier manuscripts of John have been discovered

Interesting where and which How are they dated How old are they

Unfortunately I haven't got the info at hand  It was I think in the late
's or early 's and it was possibly as old as CE 

 
When they are from about  why do they shed doubt on the order on
putting John after the rest of the three
 
 
I don't see your point it is exactly what James Felder said  They had no
first hand knowledge of the events and it obvious that at least two of them
used older texts as the base of their account  And even the association of
Luke to Paul or Mark to Peter are not generally accepted

Well a genuine letter of Peter would be close enough wouldn't it

 
Sure an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be
fine So what's that supposed to say Am I missing something
 
 
And I don't think a one step removed source is that bad  If Luke and Mark
and Matthew learned their stories directly from diciples then I really
cannot believe in the sort of big transformation from Jesus to gospel that
some people posit  In news reports one generally gets no better
information than this

And if John IS a diciple then there's nothing more to be said

 
That John was a disciple is not generally accepted The style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument
 
The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel
of John itself Is there any other evidence for it
 
One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times Compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies
Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources
 
 
It is also obvious that Mark has been edited How old are the oldest
manuscripts To my knowledge which can be antiquated the oldest is
quite after any of these estimates and it is not even complete

The only clear editing is problem of the ending and it's basically a
hopeless mess  The oldest versions give a strong sense of incompleteness
to the point where the shortest versions seem to break off in midsentence
The most obvious solution is that at some point part of the text was lost
The material from verse  on is pretty clearly later and seems to represent
a synopsys of the end of Luke

In other words one does not know what the original of Mark did look like
and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak
 
But how is that connected to a redating of John

 Didn't you say Lucifer was created with a perfect nature

Yes

 
Define perfect then
 
 
 I think you
 are playing the usual game here make sweeping statements like omni
 holy or perfect and don't note that they mean exactly what they say
 And that says that you must not use this terms when it leads to
 contradictions

I'm not trying to play games here  But I understand how it might seem
that way especially when one is coming from a completely different point
of view such as atheism

 
Take your foot out of your mouth I wondered about that already when I
was a Catholic Christian The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable
is one of the reasons why I am an atheist
 
Believe me I believed similar sentences for a long time But that shows
the power of religion and not anything about its claims
 
 
Now God could have prevented Lucifer's fall by taking away his ability
to choose between moral alternatives worship God or worship himself
but that would mean that God was in error to have make Lucifer or any
being with free will in the first place

 Exactly God allows evil an evil if there ever was one


Now that's an opinion or at best a premise  But from my point of view
it is not a premise which is necessary true specifically that it is
an evil to allow evil to occur

 
It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used Letting evil
happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil
is another evil
 
 
 But could you give a definition of free will Especially in the
 presence of an omniscient being

Will is selfdetermination  In other words God created conscious
beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently
of God  All will therefore is free will

 
The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even
before the omnipotent has created them There is no choice left All is known
the course of events is fixed
 
Not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by James Tims
 
 
If God is omniscient then
clearly creating beings with free moral choice is a greater good than
the emergence of ungodliness evilsin since He created them knowing
the outcome in advance

 Why is it the greater good to allow evil with the knowledge that it
 will happen Why not make a unipolar system with the possibility of
 doing good or not doing good but that does not necessarily imply
 doing evil It is logically possible but your god has not done it

I do not know that such is logically possible  If God restrains a
free being's choice to choose to do evil and simply do not good
then can it be said that the being truly has a free moral choice
And if good is defined as loving and obeying God and avoiding
those behaviors which God prohibits then how can you say that one
who is not good is not evil as well  Like I said I am not sure
that doing not good without doing evil is logically possible
 
And when I am not omnipotent how can I have free will You have said
something about choices and the scenario gives them Therefore we have
what you define as free will
 
Imagine the following I can do good to other beings but I cannot harm them
Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good
deeds but don't make them long for them so they can not feel the absence
of good as evil
 
But whose case am I arguing It is conceivable so the omnipotent can do it
Or it would not be omnipotent If you want logically consistent as well you
have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first
 
Deletion

Perhaps it is weak in a way  If I were just speculating about the
ubiquitous pink unicorns then there would be no basis for such
speculation  But this idea of God didn't just fall on me out of the
blue  or while reading science fiction or fantasy  I know that
some will disagree    The Bible describes a God who is omniscient
and nevertheless created beings with free moral choice from which
the definitional logic follows  But that's not all there is to it
There seems to be at least in my mind a certain amount of evidence
which indicates that God exists and that the Biblical description
of Him may be a fair one  It is that evidence which bolsters the
argument in my view
 
That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys
the credibility of the bible nothing less
 
And a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god
unfortunately there can't be any with these definitions

When they are victimized they are Muslims When they victimize others
they are not True Muslims tm or no Muslims at all

Quite annoying

I don't understand the point of this petty sarcasm It is a basic
principle of Islam that if one is born muslim or one says I testify
that there is no god but God and Mohammad is a prophet of God that
so long as one does not explicitly reject Islam by word then one must
be considered muslim by all muslims So the phenomenon you're attempting
to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic
Islamic principles If you want to attack Islam you could do better than
than to argue against something that Islam explicitly contradicts

 
It was no criticism of Islam for a change it was a criticism of the
arguments used Namely whenever people you identify as Muslims are
the victims of the attacks of others they are used an argument for
the bad situation of Muslims But whenever deeds by Muslim that victimize
others are named they do not count as an argument because what these
people did was not done as a true Muslims No mention is made how Muslims
are the cause of a bad situation of another party

There is a good deal more confusion here   You started off with the 
assertion that there was some objective morality and as you admit
here you finished up with a recursive definition   Murder is 
objectively immoral but eactly what is murder and what is not itself
requires an appeal to morality

Yes

Now you have switch targets a little but only a little   Now you are
asking what is the goal   What do you mean by goal   Are you
suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere
and we form our morals to achieve it

Well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and
propogation of the species  Another example of a moral system is
presented within the Declaration of Independence which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  You see
to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system  That is
we shall be moral unto what end

Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule  And I thought I had
defined murder as an intentional killing of a nonmurderer against his will
And you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an
innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not
I fail to see what this has to do with anything  I never claimed that our
system of morality was an objective one
I thought that was your very first claim   That there was
some kind of objective morality and that an example of that was
that murder is wrong   If you don't want to claim that any more
that's fine

Well murder violates the golen rule which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system  However I am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral  I think that
it is a very good approximation but we can't be perfect

And by the way you don't seem to understand the difference between
arbitrary and objective   If Keith Schneider defines murder
to be this that and the other that's arbitrary   Jon Livesey may
still say Well according to my personal system of morality all
killing of humans against their will is murder and wrong and what
the legal definition of murder may be in the USA Kuweit Saudi
Arabia or the PRC may be matters not a whit to me

Well objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
concepts while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning

 the creation od DNA by random processes is incalculably remote

And you find the idea of a god more likely

But if you were to discuss the merits of racism or its psycholgical
benefits you would do well to have experienced it personally
When you speak of experiencing religion you mean someone should believe in
a religion

That's right and this is pretty impossible right  It would be ideal if
we could believe for a while just to try out religion and only then
determine which course of thought suits us best  But again this is not
possible  Not that religion warrants belief but the belief carries with
it some psychological benefits  There are also some psychological
burdens too

When you speak of experiencing racism do you mean that someone should
believe in racism or that they should have racist things done to them  For
parallelism the former must be what you meant but it seems to be an odd
usage of the phrase

Well if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism
they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually believing
in racism  Of course the parallel happens to be a poor one but you
originated it

But you don't know that capital punishment is wrong so it isn't the same
as shooting  A better analogy would be that you continue to drive your car
realizing that sooner or later someone is going to be killed in an automobile
accident  You know people get killed as a result of driving yet you
continue to do it anyway
Uh uh  You do not know that you will be the one to do the
killing  I'm not sure I'd drive a car if I had sufficient evidence to
conclude that I would necessarily kill someone during my lifetime

Yes and everyone thinks as you do  No one thinks that he is going to cause
or be involved in a fatal accident but the likelihood is surprisingly high
Just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting
blanks does not mean that you are less guilty

I don't know about Jon but I say ALL taking of human life is
murder  And I say murder is wrong in all but one situation  when
it is the only action that will prevent another murder either of
myself or another

You mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation  And you should
note that that situation will never occur  There are always other options
thank killing  Why don't you just say that all killing is wrong  This
is basically what you are saying

I'm getting a bit tired of your probabilistic arguments

Are you attempting to be condescending

That the system usually works pretty well is small consolation to
the poor innocent bastard getting the lethal injection  Is your
personal value of human life based solely on a statistical approach
You sound like an unswerving adherent to the needs of the many
outweighing the needs of the few so fuck the few

But most people have found the risk to be acceptable  You are probably
much more likely to die in a plane crash or even using an electric
blender than you are to be executed as an innocent  I personally think
that the risk is acceptable but in an ideal moral system no such risk
is acceptable  Acceptable is the fudge factor necessary in such an
approximation to the ideal

I think that about  or so people approve of the
death penalty even realizing all of its shortcomings  Doesn't this make
it reasonable  Or are you the sole judge of reasonability
Aside from revenge what merits do you find in capital punishment

Are we talking about me or the majority of the people that support it
Anyway I think that revenge or fairness is why most people are in
favor of the punishment  If a murderer is going to be punished people
that think that he should get what he deserves  Most people wouldn't
think it would be fair for the murderer to live while his victim died

Revenge  Petty and pathetic

Perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic but your views are in the
minority

We have a local televised hot topic talk show that very recently
did a segment on capital punishment  Each and every advocate of
the use of this portion of our system of jurisprudence cited the
main reason for supporting it  That bastard deserved it  True
human compassion forgiveness and sympathy

Where are we required to have compassion forgiveness and sympathy  If
someone wrongs me I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage
is removed or a similar situation is forced upon him  If someone kills
another then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn
Is not our entire moral system based on such a concept

Or are you stating that human life is sacred somehow and that it should
never be violated  This would sound like some sort of religious view
 
I mean how reasonable is imprisonment really when you think about it
Sure the person could be released if found innocent but you still
can't undo the imiprisonment that was served  Perhaps we shouldn't
imprision people if we could watch them closely instead  The cost would
probably be similar especially if we just implanted some sort of
electronic device
Would you rather be alive in prison or dead in the chair  

Once a criminal has committed a murder his desires are irrelevant

And you still have not answered my question  If you are concerned about
the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent
then why isn't this same concern shared with imprisonment  Shouldn't we
by your logic administer as minimum as punishment as possible to avoid
violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person

If I kill this person an innocent person convicted of murder
then a murder would be committed but I would not be the murderer  At least
I wouldn't reasonably be considered a murderer with reasonable being
introduced as a fudge factor necessary to account for the inability to be
totally objective due to a lack of absolutely true information
If society collective decides to carry the burden of executing
it's citizens then it also carries the blame for their innocent
blood  Each and every voter who casts a ballot in favor of
capital punishment is in part guilty of the murder of each and
every innocent victim of the system

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame  If society
accepts such a system then each member of society is to blame when
an innocent person gets executed  Those that are not in favor should
work to convince others

And most members of our society have accepted the blamethey've considered
the risk to be acceptable  Similarly every person who drives must accept
the blame for fatal traffic accidents  This is something that is surely
going to happen when so many people are driving  It is all a question of
what risk is acceptable  It is much more likely that an innocent person
will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed

  I answer from the position that we would indeed place these people
  in prison for life

  That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder but
  also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability
  to commit the same crimes again

  In other words if lifetime imprisonment doesn't work perhaps
  it's not because we're not executing these people but because
  we're not being careful enough about how we lock them up

I would say that one innocent person killed is in some sense
as bad as many   We certainly feel that way when we punish
someone for a single murder
Now if we reform system X by reducing the number of deaths
by one we produce system XX    I'd say we should not go back
to system X even though by doing so we would reintroduce only 
a single extra death

Bob seems to think that one is as bad as many in a sense somewhat stronger than
the one you indicate


  Yes I do  

  My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to
  kill people  That is it's primary and I would argue only
  purpose  To continue to kill people by a practice that has
  almost no utility especially when you know you will be killing
  innocents is unconscionable

  At the very least the existence of the prison system and our
  transportation system are based on their merits to society not
  their detriments  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent
  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued
  existence of these systems  One has to stretch the evidence and
  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment

  Just in case I wasn't clear again  We maintain a capital
  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with
  no net positive gain  Why

  Were you to pin me in a corner and ask I would have to respond

This is exactly the type of thing I was talking about before A creationist
appears on to makes a completely unsupported statement the facts of
which heshe is completely ignorant is taken to task and finally replies
with a subtle insult actually two insults

Just to make sure I am being fair let's check a few details Jack you don't
know anything about abiogenesis do you this is no sin I know next to
nothing about it either I mean anything other than this  
probability thing which you got wrong in the first post

The speculation involved is really your own isn't it How much biology
do you know even apart from abiogenesis Any classes past high school
Read Chris Colby's FAQ How much paleontology geology etc do you know
Or are you speculating that its all speculative Do you have any basis
upon which to imply that to keep an open mind one must allow that
the earth universe and all the creatures in it could have been created
 years ago None of this is intended as a flame To say that
you don't know a subject is not the same as calling you an idiot I
don't know much about these areas but then I am not the one
calling into question all of mainstream science In other words where
do you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean that
all of physics chemistry etc are also speculative in some sense

You may have in fact not been implying that the rejection of creationism
is a sign of closemindedness or that the theory of evolution is especially
speculative in which case I have merely misinterpreted
you In this case the worst thing you could be accused of is unclear

I found a list of Biblical contradictions and cleaned it up a bit but
now I'd like some help with it  

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve
Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality an argument
from article length  And the list you have here is of poorer
quality than most  Since the quotes seem to be taken from an
online bible I doubt that there will be much problem with
verses quoted inaccurately  But that isn't the problem here

I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life but none who
denied that there were errors in transmission etc  And many of
the contradictions here  Solomon having  horse stalls in
one verse and  in another  are just the sort of
contradiction that fundies don't have a problem with in my
experience  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount to
anything more than attacking a straw man

Some of the others are just silly or rely on taking quotes out
of context or have reasonable explanations  But even the ones
that are genuine contradictions need to have more said about
them than what is given here  At the very least some effort
should be made to understand and respond to the common replies
given by fundies  Look for example at the research that Dave
Butler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre
That would be an excellent start for an antiinerrancy list that
would have some teeth  One wellresearched and documented
contradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken out
of context and thrown together in a list

Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together to
make a bible verse salad just don't cut it  Those of us who
want to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thing
as embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell

dj

PS You can find some good material at ftprutgersedu in
pubsocreligionchristianotherscontradictions  The quality
is very uneven on both sides of the argument it is just a
compilation of things many people have written but some of
it would be useful in an antiinerrancy FAQ  After exams I
might be willing to help put it together

liveseysolntzewpdsgicom Jon Livesey writes

Much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself
this is probably the wrong group for it  The only relevance here
is that you don't seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment
actually is and when it is murder  That is when you tell us murder
is wrong you are using a term you have not yet defined

Well I've said that when an innocent person has been executed this is
objectively a murder  However who is at blame is another question
It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions
realizing the risksis to blame

There is a probability of 
killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and 
there is a probability of killing an innocent person when the
state administers a system of capital punishment  So when you do
either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or 
later result in the killing of an innocent person

Yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing
any raondom activity  Presumably you had not isolated yourself totally
from the rest of society because of this

And driving will kill people as will airlines but people continue to do
both
Driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling
prisoners by Courts  They are risks that we take upon ourselves
willingly

And I argue that our law system is a similar risk  Perhaps an innocent
person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this  In fact
many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment
of innocents

If our own driving kills someone else then sure there is a moral
issue  I know at least one person who was involved in a fatal
accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards

But such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals
on the road  Again the blame is on society

No I'm not  This is what you said  You were saying that if there were such
a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed
 it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual killing
No I just commented that the state does the killing  It does not
depend on there being false witnesses  How could it  The state
does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes

Yes but the state is not at fault in such a case  The state can only do
so much to prevent false witnesses

It is possible  So what are you trying to say that capital punishment
is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating
the system
I'm saying capital punishment is murder period  Not because of
this that and the other but because it involves taking human life
That's my definition of murder  I make no appeals to dictionaries
or to objective morals

Okay so this is what you call murder  But the question is whether or not
all such murders are wrong  Are you saying that all taking of human life
is wrong no matter what the circumstances

If we as a society decide to murder someone then we should say
that and lists our reasons for doing so and live with the moral
consequences  We should not play word games and pretend that
murder isn't murder  And that's my opinion about how society
ought to be run

But this is basically how it works  Society accepts the risk that an
innocent person will be murdered by execution  And every member of
society shares this blame  And most people's definitions of murder
include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an
execution is it

But we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its
possibilty  What ramifications does your personal system have on an
objective one
No we were not discussing an objective moral system  I was showing
you that you didn't have one because for one thing you were incapable
of defining the terms in it for example murder

Murder violates the golden rule  Executions do not because by allowing
it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the
innocent victim is

We're not talking about reading minds we are just talking about knowing the
truth  Yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but
the court systems work on a principle of knowing the truth beyond a
reasonable doubt  
Sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately  Here
is what you said
	And since we are looking totally objectively at this case
	then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to
	execute the person or not  If the intent is malicious and 
	unfair then the execution would be murder
What you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is
quite different  The jury being persuaded beyond a serious
doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond
a serious doubt

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction
was moral or not  But in an objective system only the absolute truth
matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth  That
is twelve members must be convinced of a truth

Moreover a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background
may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence
that you and I would laugh at

But then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the
conviction was unfair

But would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds  If we assume that
it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less
fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute
truth
It's not a question of fairness  Your claim which I have quoted
above is a claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to
be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder

Yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all
possible information we can't always determine the difference in our
flawed system  I think that our system is almost as good as possible
but it still isn't objectively perfect  You see it doesn't matter if
we know it is fair or not  Objectively it is either fair or it is not

Now there's a huge difference  If we can read minds we can know
and if we cannot read minds we can know nothing  The difference
is not in degree of fairness but in what we can know

But what we know has no effect on an objective system

I think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system if we are
clear on which goals it is supposed to promote
I'm not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that I am
pretty sure does not exist

Why are you so sure

I simply want people to confront reality  My reality remember

Why is your reality important

In this case the reality is that ideal theories' apart we can
never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice
system  For every innocent person released from Death Row there
may have been a dozen innocent people executed or a hundred or
none at all  We simply don't know

But we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely
And you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a
totally ideal and objective system

Now what are we going to do  On the one hand we can pretend
that we have an 'ideal' theory and that we can know things we can
never know and the Justie System is fair and that we can wave a 
magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder and go 
on our way

Well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal
We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to
the ideal system as possible

On the other hand we can recognize that all Justice has a small
 we hope  probability of punishing the innocent and that in the
end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic
consequences of the systems we set up and then say Well here
we go murdering again  Maybe some of us will even say Gee I
wonder if all this is strictly necessary

Yes we all bear the responsibility  Most people seem willing to do this

I think that the second is preferable in that if requires people
to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society instead
of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word 
games

We must realize the consequences of all our actions  Why do you keep
separating the justice system from the pack

And lest I forget I also don't think we have an objective moral
system and I believe I only have to take that idea seriously
when someone presents evidence of it

I don't think our country has an objective system but I think such an
objective system can exist in theory  Without omniscience an objective
system is not possible in practice

 Your statistics indicate people that have declared atheism

And doubtless when an atheist does an act of charity
they temporarily become a Baptist

  I propose that these two trends  greater level of general 
 depression in society and other psychological problems and 
 greater sexual promiscuity  are linked with the latter being 
 a prime cause of the former  I cannot provide any evidence beyond 
 this at this stage but the whole thesis seems very reasonable to 
 me and I request that people ponder upon it

I pondered it for all of ten seconds when I realised that since
we don't have any reliable statistics for sexual promiscuity
and since the whole issue of depression isn't at all well 
defined for earlier centuries you are probably talking crap

Of course you could pull a Mozumder on us and say that people
who are having sex outside marriage are defined to be depressed

I can't say I'd ever noticed myself

Now can we please use recscouting for the purpose for which it was
established  Clearly we netnews voters decided that we did not want to

Ok this is the only thing I will comment on from Stan at this time
part of this forum we call recscouting is for policy discussions and
related topics  This is a policy discussion and involves related 
topics  this is not a fringe group discussion  obviously it 
engenders strong feelings from all sides of the issues at hand 
Wether a particular view is antisocietal or not is your opinion

Subject EnviroLeague

Birth Announcement on March   from EARTH Forum CompuServe
                       Information Service

 
                     FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT
                     
 
                                     SM
                        EnviroLeague
 
A new youth movementEnviroLeague was recently born according to its
founder Boyd R Critz III CIS ID  of Peoria Illinois
EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth both male and female in
matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our
environment
 
Incorporated as an Illinois notforprofit corporation its Articles and
initial applications for a service mark have now been filed  According to
Critz its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and
Objectives
 
                           MISSION
 
   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members
   to foster and implement the improved education of young
   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards
   of The Earth to leave The Earth in a better condition
   than they found it and to otherwise act as responsible
   moral and ethical users of their environment  To pursue
   the accomplishment of this Mission EnviroLeague shall
   seek to serve as a catalyst focusing in common cause the
   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation
   improvement and responsible use of the environment in
   which we must all live
 
                         OBJECTIVES
 
   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague its primary
   objectives shall be
         To establish a Movement involving as many
            environmentally concerned organizations as
            possible said Movement having as its primary
            focus the education and participatory
            involvement of young people in appropriate areas
            of environmental concern
         To develop and provide to such organizations and
            their branches a full complement of program
            materials for their use including suitable
            uniforms insignia and other badges written
            ideas syllabi and information literature and
            other items as shall seem appropriate and
            desirable
         To serve as a clearing house for the exchange
            of program ideas materials and information
            among said organizations  and
         To assist environmentally concerned
            organizations to recruit and train the necessary
            adult leadership for their youth programs
 
EnviroLeague will operate through three Program Divisions serving youth in
the elementary middle and high school grades respectively  Service shall be
through formation of EnviroLeague Teams either by EnviroLeague itself or by
environmentally conscious organizations or their local branches wishing a
charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague
 
EnviroLeague as it develops will be controlled by the actual adult leaders
of each local Team and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to
membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper
conduct Organizations accepting a charter may however impose certain
additional standards for their own use of the program material  Should such
organizations do so EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming as soon as
possible new nearby Teams having no such restrictions particularly as to
youth membership
 
EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to
contribute to developing its programs  Thus the top youth leaders of its
Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any
local administrative groups and those for its high school youth may be
involved in similar functions at the national level
 
Program materials are in development at this time  Copies of the draft
portions of the Mentor's Manual manual for adult leadership will be in the
EARTH Forum Library  These files will be updated as development takes
place
 
CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this
electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation
This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH
Forums
 
The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum  GO
EARTH  message and library areas  both named EnviroLeague

 
Subsequently EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first
meeting  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian
equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO  He can be reached at home
  in case of real need  Also mail can be addressed to
       EnviroLeague
       PO Box 
       Peoria IL  
 
Those interested in starting an EnviroLeague Team might just establish
contact to receive a diskette IBM DOS ASCII with initial information

I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world
if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population 
It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways I know but my newsreader is
down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit so I figure I might as
well post something new myself

Also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a
higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking  The
typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the
same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the
other qualitatively  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn
somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core
than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it
expresses its own selfishness

 categories of atheism Function format due to mathewmantiscouk I

 i weak    notbelievegods
 
 ii strong    believenotgods
 
deleted
 
 
 
 I  am a strong atheist and I must quibble with your assertion 
 that the strong' position requires faith I believe that no gods 
 as commonly described by theists exist This belief is merely an 
                                           
 opinion formed on the basis of observation including a certain 
  
 amount of introspection
  
 
 I fully accept that I could be wrong and will be swayed by suitably
 convincing evidence Thus while I believe that no gods exist this does
                       
 not imply faith on my part that it is so
  

Let me first say that to believe that no gods exist is in fact 
different than not believing in a god or gods 

I will argue that your latter statement I believe that no gods exist
does rest upon faith  that is if you are making a POSITIVE statement 
that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying I don't  
know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then
weak atheism Once again to not believe in God is different than saying  
I BELIEVE that God does not exist I still maintain the position even 
after reading the FAQs that strong atheism requires faith

But first let me say the following
We might have a language problem here  in regards to faith and
existence I as a Christian maintain that God does not exist
To exist means to have being in space and time God does not HAVE
being  God IS Being Kierkegaard once said that God does not
exist He is eternal With this said I feel it's rather pointless
to debate the so called existence of God  and that is not what
I'm doing here I believe that God is the source and ground of
being When you say that god does not exist I also accept this
statement  but we obviously mean two different things by it However
in what follows I will use the phrase the existence of God in it's
'usual sense'  and this is the sense that I think you are using it
I would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of
God
 
We also might differ upon what it means to have faith Here is what
Webster says

faith 
a allegiance to duty or a person LOYALTY
b   fidelity to one's promises
    sincerity of intentions
a  belief and trust in and loyalty to God
    belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion
b   firm belief in something for which there is no proof
        
    complete trust
 something that is believed esp with strong conviction esp a system 
   
of religious beliefs
syn see BELIEF



One can never prove that God does or does not exist When you say
that you believe God does not exist and that this is an opinion
based upon observation I will have to ask what observtions are
you refering to There are NO observations  pro or con  that
are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief All observations
can only point you in a direction  a direction that we might even
be predisposed to by predisposed I mean for example people whoes 
partents believe in God also tend to To actually draw a conclusion
about the existence or nonexistence of God requires a leap  and
you have made this leap when you actively say I believe that God  
doesdoes not exist Personally I think that both statements are
misguided Arguing over the existence of God is precisely the wrong way
to find Him and yes I use Him because a personal God is the only 
viable concept IMO  if a person wants to use She go ahead Of course 
God is neither He nor She  but we have no choice but to 
anthropomorphise If you want me to explain myself further I'll be 
glad to 



And please if someone does not agree with me  even if they violently 
disagree  it's in no ones advantage to start name calling If a person 
thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs or if they they think 
I have not read them well enough just point out to me the error of my 
ways and I correct the situation I'm interested in a polite and well  
thought out discussion

 More horrible deaths resulted from atheism than anything else

There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both
atheists AND theists  I'm sure Bobby can list quite a few for the atheist
side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at
genocide  Perhaps since I'm a bit weak on history somone here would like
to give a list of wars causedled by theists  I can think of a few Hitler
claimed to be a Christian for example but a more complete list would
probably be more effective in showing Bobby just how absurd his statement
is

 Peace

On a side note I notice you always sign your posts Peace  Perhaps you
should take your own advice and leave the atheists in peace with their
beliefs

liveseysolntzewpdsgicom Jon Livesey writes



There is a good deal more confusion here   You started off with the 
assertion that there was some objective morality and as you admit
here you finished up with a recursive definition   Murder is 
objectively immoral but eactly what is murder and what is not itself
requires an appeal to morality


I think you mean circular not recursive but that is semantics
Recursiveness has no problems it is just horribly inefficient just ask
any assembly programmer

Yes

Now you have switch targets a little but only a little   Now you are
asking what is the goal   What do you mean by goal   Are you
suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere
and we form our morals to achieve it

Well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and
propogation of the species  Another example of a moral system is
presented within the Declaration of Independence which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  You see
to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system  That is
we shall be moral unto what end

The oftquoted line that says people should be guaranteed life liberty
and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights is a complete lie
and deception as the very authors of that line were in the process of
proving  Liberty is never free it is always purchased at some cost 
almost always at the cost to another  Whos liberty is more inalienable
Similarly for right of life  When one person must die if he is to save
another or even a group of others whos life is more inalienable  
That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty 
especially for serial killers  Whos life and liberty is more valuable
the serial killer or the victim  According to that beautiful line
those two rights should be completely inviolate that is noone should be
able to remove them  This includes government  Admittedly the serial
killer has restricted some people's life andor liberty but is not his
own lifeliberty inviolate also  According to the declaration of independence
it is

Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule  And I thought I had
defined murder as an intentional killing of a nonmurderer against his will

Oooh I like that  It means that killing an infant is not murder because
it cannot be against its will  Reason an infant has no will as such

Similarly for people who are brain dead easier to see in a coma etc

Also under current law accidental killing is still murder  How will you
include that

And you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an
innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not
I fail to see what this has to do with anything  I never claimed that our
system of morality was an objective one
I thought that was your very first claim   That there was
some kind of objective morality and that an example of that was
that murder is wrong   If you don't want to claim that any more
that's fine

The only real golden rule in life is he who has the gold makes the
rules  Ie Might Makes Right  That is survival  Now what is wrong
with that

Well murder violates the golen rule which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system  However I am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral  I think that
it is a very good approximation but we can't be perfect

If you mean the golden rule as I stated yes almost every system as
implemented has used that in reality  Sorry I don't deal as much in
fiction as I do in reality  

And by the way you don't seem to understand the difference between
arbitrary and objective   If Keith Schneider defines murder
to be this that and the other that's arbitrary   Jon Livesey may
still say Well according to my personal system of morality all
killing of humans against their will is murder and wrong and what
the legal definition of murder may be in the USA Kuweit Saudi
Arabia or the PRC may be matters not a whit to me

WELCOME TO OZLAND 

What is NOT arbitrary  If you can find some part of society some societal
rules morals etc that are not arbitrary please tell me  I don't think
there are any

Well objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
concepts while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning

keith
Sounds like euphemisms to me  The difference seems to be that objective
is some reasoning that I like while arbitrary is some reasoning that
I don't like OR don't understand

 that a god does not exist but if anyone has one by all means tell me
 what it is  Therefore lacking this ability of absolute proof being an
 atheist becomes an act of faith in and of itself and this I cannot accept
  I accept nothing on blind faith

 Invisible Pink Flying Unicorns  Need I say more

There is also the question of what is meant by atheist  A familiar
example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows

The two statements following ARE consistent

 I do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks
 I do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks

The two statements following are NOT consistent

 I do believe that you are wearing lilac socks
 I do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks

Statements  and  require no faith they make no presumptions about
the nature of reality  Statements  and  require belief  Many
atheists myself included take the following position

 I do not believe that there is a god
 I do not believe that there is not a god

That is  I harbor no beliefs at all there is no good evidence
for god existing or not  Some folks call this agnosticism  It does not
suffer from blind faith at all  I think of it as Don't worry be happy

No  Agnosticism as you have here defined it is a positive beliefa

That's a belief I'm inclined to reject  You have also defined atheism
here as a positive beliefthat there is no god  A fairly large number
of atheists on altatheism reject this definition instead holding that
atheism is simply the absence of belief in a god  Michael Martin in

SSAUYETeaglewesleyanedu SCOTT D SAUYET writes

First I'll make the assumption that you agree that a murderer is one
who has commited murder

Well I'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder
For instance if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain
blanks and someone was killed with such a gun the person who actually
performed the action isn't the murderer but I guess this is actually made
clear in the below definition

I'd be interested to see a more reasonable definition 

What do you mean by reasonable

Otherwise your inductive definition doesn't bottom out
Your definition in essence is that
Murder is the intentional killing of someone who has not commited 
murder against his will
Expanding the second occurence of murder' in the above we see that


Yes it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition  But
even though the series is recursively infinite I think the meaning can
still be deduced

I assume you can see the problem here  To do a correct inductive
definition you must define something in terms of a simpler case and
you must have one or several bottoming out cases  For instance we
can define the factorial function the function which assigns to a
positive integer the product of the positive integers less than or
equal to it on the positive integers inductively as follows

math lesson deleted

Okay let's look at this situation  suppose there is a longstanding
feud between two families which claim that the other committed some
travesty in the distant past  Each time a member of the one family
kills a member of the other the other family thinks that it is justified
in killing a that member of the first family  Now let's suppose that this
sequence has occurred an infinite number of times  Or if you don't
like dealing with infinities suppose that one member of the family
goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing  That is there
is a neverending loop of slayings based on some nonexistent travesty
How do you resolve this

Well they are all murders

Now I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your problem but
it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system

And in any case the nested murderer in the definition of murder
cannot be infintely recursive given the finite existence of humanity
And a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved  So the
first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily
a murderer  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently
unreducable definition  See in a totally objective system where all the
information is available such a nested definition isn't really a problem

I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world
if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population 

Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in
emphasis  Weekends might not be so inviolate more common to work  days
a week in a business and instead of American Atheists we would have
similar religious organizations  A persons religious belief seems more
as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions
Of course people would have to come up with more fascinating 
rationalizations for their actions but that could be fun to watch

It seems to me that for most people religion in America doesn't matter
that much  You have extreemists on both ends but a large majority don't
make too much of an issue about it as long as you don't  Now admittedly
I have never had to suffer the Bible Belt but I am just north of it
and see the fringes and the reasonable people in most things tend to be
reasonable in religion as well  


Also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a
higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking  The
typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the
same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the
other qualitatively  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn
somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core
than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it
expresses its own selfishness


I don't bother according a higher value to my thinking or just about
anybodys thinking  I don't want to fall in that trap  Because if you 
do start that then you are then to decide which is better says whom
why is there a best and also what to do about those who have inferior
modes of thinking  IDIC  Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations

 Of course Bobby then states that Satan has no free will that
    he does as God wants him to  This brings up a host of
    paradoxes  is God therefore evil do I have free will
    or is God directing me also if God is evil which part
    of his infinite self is good and which is evil etc

 I would like for once a solid answer not a runabout

 I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one I simply don't agree
 with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force
 I wrote

 The belief to which I ascribe is that evil is not a creation
 rather it is the absence of good  This fits with all the
 logic about things having dual use eg a knife can be used
 to sculpt and it can be used to kill  Like entropy evil is
 seen in this view as neither force nor entity  Satan is
 therefore metaphorical  In fact there are several verses
 of the Holy Qur'an which appear to support this view and several
 Traditions as well

 For example there is a Tradition that food should never be left open
 on a shelf or table overnight lest Satan enter it  It appears
 that this is a reference to as yet undiscovered germs thus the
 evil effect of spoiled food is described as Satan

But there are many examples of Satan personified  Which am I
     to believe

 And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the
 Holy Qur'an the Bible etc  There have been times in the spiritual
 and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical
 descriptions of Heaven Hell and Satan were taken quite literally
 and that worked for the time  As I mentioned in the Tradition
 cited above for example it was sufficient in the absence of a theory
 about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil
 which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic

     Which begs the question if Satan in this case is
     metaphorical how can you be certain Allah is not
     the same way

 The bottom line here however is that describing a spiritual plane
 in human language is something like describing color to a person
 who has been blind from birth  You may want to read the book
 FLATLAND if you haven't already or THE DRAGON'S EGG  The first
 is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con
 cept

some deleted for space saving

 When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe
 another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers then
 such conventions as metaphor allegory and the like come to be
 necessary  The unseen is described in terms which have reference
 and meaning for the readerlistener  But like all models a compro
 mise must be made when speaking metaphorically clarity and directness
 of meaning equivalence of perception and the like are all
 crippled  But what else can you do

     This is why I asked the above  How would you then
     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than
     just being metaphorical  I mean it's okay to say
     well Satan is just metaphorical but then you
     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is
     not some metaphor for something else

     I say this because there are many many instances of
     Satan described as a being such as the tormentor in 
     the Old Testament book of Job or the temptor in the
     New Testament Gospels  In the same way God too is
     described as a being or spirit  How am I to know
     one is metaphorical and not the other

     Further belief in God isn't a bar to evil  Let's
     consider the case of Satanists even if Satan were
     metaphorical the Satanist would have to believe
     in God to justify this belief  Again we have a 
     case where someone does believe in God but by
     religious standards they are evil  If Bobby
     does see this let him address this question also

deleted some more on metaphor

 Obviously more philosophizing on this issue is possible but I'm
 not sure that the readers of this newsgroup would want to delve
 into religious interpretation further  However if anyone wishes
 to discuss this I'm certainly willing either off line  email  or
 on line  posting

that he would apologieze if he were wrong which takes seeing that he
would be wrong in some situation or other

brother would see himself as honorable and not see his mother's point of

seem to find words that my mother understands on some issues of boundaries
and such personal things  Not that we dont talk or anything quite so

   Just what do gay people do that straight people don't

Absolutely nothing

I'm a VERY straightas an arrow year old male that is involved in the BSA

I don't care what gay people do among each other as long as they don't make
passes at me or anything  At my summer camp where I work my boss is gay
Not in a 'pansy' way of gay I know a few but just 'one of the guys'
He doesn't push anything on me and we give him the same respect back due
to his position

If anything the BSA has taught me I don't know tolerance or something
Before I met this guy I thought all gays were 'faries'  So the BSA HAS
taught me to be an antibigot

Basically It comes down to this What you do among yourself is your own
business No one else has the right to tell you otherwise unless it

  Sorry but there are no supernatural

  what would you say about acid rain meteors falling from the
  sky volcanoes earthquakes and other QUOTE UNQUOTE Acts
  of God 
 
 I would say that they are not acts of God but natural
 occurrences

It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not
the result of the natural process of evolution but rather an act of God
and then in the same post say that these other processes volcanos et al
are natural occurrences  Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are
natural processes and what are direct acts of God  How do you know that
God doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose
in mind  It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in
the bible

 Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of
 disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since
 humanity forsook God's protection  If we choose to live apart from
 God's law humanity collectively then it should come as no surprise
 that there are adverse consequences to our collective action  One
 of these is that we are left to deal with disease and disorders which
 inevitably result in an entropic universe
  
  May I ask where is this 'collective' bullcrap coming from 

 By collective I was referring to the idea that God works with
 humanity on two levels individually and collectively  If mankind
 as a whole decides to undertake a certain action the majority of
 mankind then God will allow the consequences of that action to
 affect mankind as a whole

Adam  Eve TWO PEOPLE even tho they had the honor or so you christians
claim of being the first two definitely do NOT represent a majority in
the billions and trillions probably more of people that have come after
them  Perhaps they were the majority then but I and YOU weren't
around to vote and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to
do with that tree  But your god never asked us  He just assumes that if
you have two bad people then they ALL must be bad  Hmm  Sounds like the
same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting
here resorting to  So THAT's where they get it shoulda known

   Can god uncreate itself
 
 No  For if He did He would violate His own nature which He cannot do
 It is God's nature to Exist  He is after all the I AM which is
 a statement of His inherent Existence  He is existence itself
 Existence cannot notexist

Then as mentioned above he must not be very omnipotent


What do you mean by omnipotent here  Do you mean by omnipotent
that God should be able to do anythingeverything  This creates
a selfcontradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively
useless

To be descriptive omnipotence must mean being allpowerful and
not being able to do anythingeverything

Let me illustrate by analogy
Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth  Suppose
further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any
nation or group of nations  The US has the power to go into any country
at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the
US see fit  The US would be militarily omnipotent

But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrinephilosophy of not
interfering in the internal affairs of any nation such as the current
civil war in the former Yugoslavian states

Technically in this scenario the US would have the power to 
unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess  But
effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy 
of noninterference  If the policy of noninterference were held to
strongly enough then there would never be a question that it would
ever be violated  Effectively the US would be limited in what it
could actually do although it had the power to do whatever it wanted
The US would simply never want to interfere for such an idea would
be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate
noninterference policy

God is effectively limited in the same sense  He is all powerful but
He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what
He Himself is

I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning
omnipotence

Regards

Jim B

 Okay  So you want me to name names  There are obviously no official
 records of these pseudomarriages because they are performed for
 convenience  What happens typically is that the woman is willing to move
 in with her lover without any scruples or legal contracts to speak of 
 The man is merely utilizing a loophole by entering into a temporary
 religious marriage contract in order to have sex  Nobody complains
 nobody cares nobody needs to know
 
 Perhaps you should alert your imam  It could be that this practice is
 far more widespread than you may think  Or maybe it takes  muslim men
 to witness the penetration to decide if the practice exists
  
 
 
 Again you astound me with the level of ignorance you display Muslims
 are NOT allowed to enter temporary marriages got that There is
 no evidence for it it an outlawed practise so get your facts 
 straight buddy Give me references for it or just tell everyone you
 were lying It is not a widespread as you may think fantasise in
 fact contrary to your fantasies it is not practised at all amongst
 Muslims

First of all I'm not your buddy  Second read what I wrote  I'm not
talking about what muslims are ALLOWED to do merely what SOME
practice  They consider themselves as muslim as you so don't retort
with the old and tired they MUST NOT BE TRUE MUSLIMS bullshit  If I
gave you the names what will you do with this information  Is a fatwa
going to be leashed out against the perpetrators  Do you honestly think
that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess 
With the kind of extremism shown by your coreligionaries  Fat chance

At any rate there can be no conclusive proof by the very nature of
the act  Perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you in
theory but hope that Allah will forgive them in the end

I think it's rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslims
in this regard  Also kind of silly  Are you insinuating that because
the Koranic law forbids it there are no criminals in muslim countries 

This is as far as I care to go on this subject  The weakness of your
arguments are for all netters to see  Over and out

 There is a good deal more confusion here   You started off with the 
 assertion that there was some objective morality and as you admit
 here you finished up with a recursive definition   Murder is 
 objectively immoral but eactly what is murder and what is not itself
 requires an appeal to morality
 
 Yes
 
 Now you have switch targets a little but only a little   Now you are
 asking what is the goal   What do you mean by goal   Are you
 suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere
 and we form our morals to achieve it
 
 Well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and
 propogation of the species 


I got just this far   What do you mean by goal    I hope you
don't mean to imply that evolution has a conscious goal

 Now along comes Mr Keith Schneider and says Here is an objective

 that this objective system depends on and predictably the whole
 thing falls apart
 
 It only falls apart if you attempt to apply it  This doesn't mean that
 an objective system can't exist  It just means that one cannot be
 implemented

It's not the fact that it can't exist that bothers me   It's 
the fact that you don't seem to be able to define it

If I wanted to hear about indefinable things that might in
principle exist as long as you don't think about them too
carefully I could ask a religious person now couldn't I

 How long does it the motto have to stay around before it becomes the

 I don't know where the exact cutoff is but it is at least after a few
 years and surely after  years
 Why does the notion of default not take into account changes
 in population makeup     
 
 Specifically which changes are you talking about  Are you arguing
 that the motto is interpreted as offensive by a larger portion of the
 population now than  years ago

No do I have to    I'm just commenting that it makes very
little sense to consider everything we inherit to be the default

But then I ask So  Where is this relevant to my discussion in
answering John's question of why  Why are there genetic diseases
and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require
babies to develop antibodies  Is it God's fault the original
question  I say no it is not

Most of Scotty's followup was irrelevant to the original question
but this is not unusual as threads often quickly evolve away from
the original topic  What I could not understand is why Jim spent so
much time responding to what he regarded as irrelevancies

    
 May I ask where is this 'collective' bullcrap coming from
    

By collective I was referring to the idea that God works with
humanity on two levels individually and collectively  If mankind
as a whole decides to undertake a certain action the majority of
mankind

Well I guess hypothetical Adam was the majority of mankind
seeing how he was the ONLY man at the time

then God will allow the consequences of that action to
affect mankind as a whole  If you didn't understand that then I
apologize for not using one and two syllable words in my discussion

I understand what you mean by collective but I think it is an
insane perversion of justice  What sort of judge would punish the
descendants for a crime committed by their ancestor

If you want to be sure that I read your post and to provide a
response send a copy to JimBrownozbmdtrwcom  I can't read

Well I must admit that you probably read aa more often than I read

 Er Jon what Ken said was
  
  There have previously been people like you in your country  Unfortunately

 That sure sounds to me like Ken is accusing the guy of being a Nazi
 

my previous posting deleted

 
 Yes yes  This is a perfectly fine rant and I agree with it completely
 But what does it have to do with anything  The issue at hand here
 is whether or not Ken accused the fellow from Germany of being a
 Nazi  I grant that he did not explicity make this accusation but
 he came pretty damn close  He is certainly accusing the guy of
 sympathizing with those who would like to exterminate the Jews and
 that's good enough for me

The poster casually trashed two thousand years of Jewish history and 
Ken replied that there had previously been people like him in Germany

That's right   There have been    There have also been people who
were formally Nazis   But the Nazi party would have gone nowhere
without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the
street who behaved as though casual antisemitism was perfectly
acceptable

Now what exactly don't you understand about what I wrote and why
don't you see what it has to do with the matter at hand

 Well Germany was hardly the ONLY country to discriminate against the 
 Jews although it has the worst reputation because it did the best job 
 of expressing a general European dislike of them  This should not turn 
 into a debate on antisemitism but you should also point out that Luther's
  antiSemitism was based on religious grounds while Hitler's was on racial 
 grounds and Wagnmer's on aesthetic grounds  Just blanketing the whole

I find these to be intriguing remarks   Could you give us a bit

and which aesthetic

 I don't know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying

I think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long

 I don't understand the point of this petty sarcasm It is a basic 
 principle of Islam that if one is born muslim or one says I testify
 that there is no god but God and Mohammad is a prophet of God that
 so long as one does not explicitly reject Islam by word then one must
 be considered muslim by all muslims So the phenomenon you're attempting
 to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic
 Islamic principles If you want to attack Islam you could do better than
 than to argue against something that Islam explicitly contradicts

More horrible deaths resulted from atheism than anything else

In earlier posts you stated that true Muslim believers were incapable of
evil  I suppose if you believe that you could reason that no one has ever
been killed in the name of religion  What a perfect world you live in

One of the reasons that you are atheist is that you limit God by giving
God a form  God does not have a face

Bobby is referring to a rather obscure law in The Good Atheist's

You must excuse us Bobby  When we argue against theism we usually argue
against the Christian idea of God  In the realm of Christianity man was

I found a list of Biblical contradictions and cleaned it up a bit

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve

It's about time  Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention
to the bible anyway

Face it there are better things to do with your life  I used to
chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity
of people believing in it as truth etc  Why do we spend so little
time on the Mayan religion or the Native Americans  Heck the Native
Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths  Also what
about the Egyptians

I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept
it as a religion and not a mythology which I find more accurate

 This works both logically and mathematically  God is of the set of

My favorite reply to the you are being too literalminded complaint is
that if the bible is really inspired by God and if it is really THAT
important to him then he would make damn certain all the translators and
scribes and people interpreting and copying it were getting it right
literally  If not then why should I put ANY merit at all in something
that has been corrupted over and over and over by man even if it was
originally inspired by God

The corrupted over and over theory is pretty weak  Comparison of the
current hebrew text with old versions and translations shows that the text
has in fact changed very little over a space of some two millennia  This
shouldn't be all that suprising people who believe in a text in this manner
are likely to makes some pains to make good copies
 
Do you honestly hold to that tripe Charley For a start there are enough
current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write
above is utter garbage Witness JW Mormon Catholic Anglican and Greek
Orthodox Bibles But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good
old library In our local library we had a  King James which I compared
to a brand new hot of God's tongue Good News Bible Genesis was almost
unrecognisable many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been
edited from the Good News Bible In fact the God of Good News was a much
more congenial fellow I must say 

If you like I'll get the  King James out again and actually give you
some quotes At least the headings haven't changed much

Why is it more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards
depression You can't just pick your two favorite trends notice a correlation 
in them and make a sweeping statement of generality I mean you CAN and 
people HAVE but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable thesis 
At best it's a gross oversimplification of the pushpull factors people 
experience  

I agree I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism You
think its the increase in premarital sex others thinks its because
psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent
criminals con them into letting them out into the streets others think
it's the increase in designer drugs others think it's a communist plot
Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society
are far too complicated for us to control We just have to hold on to the
panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing But one
things for sure depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not
due solely to sex out of marriage

  Deletions
  Er Jon what Ken said was
  
    There have previously been people like you in your country  Unfortunately
                               
    most Jews did not survive
  
  That sure sounds to me like Ken is accusing the guy of being a Nazi
 
 Hitler and the Nazis didn't spring fully formed from the forehead
 of Athena   They didn't invent antisemitism   They built on a 
 foundation of antisemitism that was already present in Germany   
 This foundation of antisemitism was laid down not by the Nazis 
 but by the people I listed and also by hundreds of years of unthinking 
 kneejerk bigotry on the part of perfectly ordinary people and of
 course their pastors and priests
 
 What we have to worry about today is not whether some Hollywood
 Hitler in a black uniform is going to come striding onto the German
 stage in one unprepared step but whether those same bedrock foundations
 of antisemitism are being laid down little by little in Germany
 as we speak
 
 And if so they will be laid down not by Hitlers and Himmlers who
 will come later but by people like the poster in question   The
 people who think that casual antisemitism is acceptable or even fun
                       
 
Deletions
 I did     Now may I suggest with the greatest possible respect that
 you go read some history

So you consider the german poster's remark antisemitic  Perhaps you
imply that anyone in Germany who doesn't agree with israely policy in a
nazi  Pray tell how does it even qualify as casual antisemitism 
If the term doesn't apply why then bring it up

Your own bigotry is shining through

 But could you give a definition of free will Especially in the
 presence of an omniscient being

Will is selfdetermination  In other words God created conscious
beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently
of God  All will therefore is free will

So these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of
their circumstances their genetics their environment their experiences
which are not all selfdetermined

Of course the idea of Hell makes the idea of free will dubious
On the other hand the idea of Hell is not a very powerful idea

	A Parable for You

	There was once our main character who blah blah blah
	One day a thug pointed a mean looking gun at OMC and
said 'Do what I say or I'm blasting you to hell'
	OMC thought 'If I believe this thug and follow the
instructions that will be given I'll avoid getting blasted to
hell  On the other hand if I believe this thug and do not
follow the instructions that will be given I'll get blasted to
hell  Hmm the more attractive choice is obvious I'll
follow the instructions'  Now OMC found the choice obvious
because everything OMC had learned about getting blasted to
hell made it appear very undesirable
	But then OMC noticed that the thug's gun wasn't a real
gun  The thug's threats were make believe
	So OMC ignored the thug and resumed blah blah blah

Right on Jon  Who cares who or whose as long as it works for the individual
But don't try to impose those beliefs on us or our children  I would add the
wellfunded group tries also to purge science to deny children access to great

why do babies get diseases etc
What God did create was life according to a protein code which is
mutable and can evolve  Without delving into a deep discussion of
creationism vs evolutionism

 Here's the main problem The scenario you outline is reasonably 
consistent but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does
not support it but indicates something far different The Earth by
latest estimates is about  billion years old and has had life for
about  billion of those years Humans have only been around for at
most about  years But the fossil evidence inidcates that life
has been changing and evolving and in fact diseaseridden long before
there were people Yes there are fossils that show signs of disease
mostly bone disorders of course but there are some Heck not just
fossil evidence but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows
that disease has been around for a long long time If human sin was what
brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then
how could it exist before humans

                             God created the original genetic code
perfect and without flaw  And without getting sidetracked into
the theological ramifications of the original sin the main effect
of the socalled original sin for this discussion was to remove
humanity from God's protection since by their choice AE cut
themselves off from intimate fellowship with God  In addition their
sin caused them to come under the dominion of Satan who then assumed
dominion over the earth
deletions
Since humanity was no longer under God's protection but under Satan's
dominion it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer
diseases both bacterialviral and genetic  Although the forces of
natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the
degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this  

 Uh I know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about
biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this There
is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other 'started off'
in perfect condition It seems to adapt to its envionment in a
collective sense I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the
degeneration of the genetic code'

Human DNA being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely
affecting our wellbeing and ability to fight off disease while the 
simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in 
causing infection and disease  It is a bad combination

 Umm Nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and
bacteria and they to us Only a very small percentage of microlife is
harmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby
constant in size but the ranks keep changing For example bubonic
plague used to be a really nasty disease I'm sure you'll agree But
it still pops up from time to time even today and doesn't do as
much damage Part of that is because of better sanitation but even
when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in
the past This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible
died off long ago and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed'
forgive the poor terminology I'm an engineer not a doctor   and
died off for lack of nearby hosts
 I could be wrong on this but from what I gather acne is only a few
hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer It seems to
be getting less nasty wage

                                                          Hence
we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial
diseasesdisorders

 Now wait a minute I have a question Humans were created perfect right
And you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease It
seems unlikely that Satan who's making the diseases would also gift
humans with the means to fight them off Simpler to make the diseases less
lethal if he wants survivors As far as I can see our immune systems
imperfect though they may presently be must have been built into us
by God I want to be clear on this are you saying that God was planning
ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune
system that was not at the time of design necessary That is God made
our immune systems ahead of time knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and
their descendents would need to fight off diseases

This may be more of a mysticalsupernatural explanation than you
are prepared to accept but God is not responsible for disease
Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of
disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since
humanity forsook God's protection

 Here's another puzzle What exactly do you mean by 'perfect' in the
phrase 'created perfect and without flaw' To my mind a 'perfect'
system would be incapable of degrading over time A 'perfect' system
that will without constant intervention become imperfect is not a
perfect system At least IMHO
 Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a
bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue That is the
original genetic 'instructions' were perfect but were 'written' in
inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart
If so why could God not have used better materials
 Was God incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself
of did It just choose not to

In summary newborns are innocent but God does not cause their suffering

 My main point as I said was that there really isn't any evidence for
the explanation you give At least that I'm aware of But I couldn't
help making a few nitpicks here and there

 Now back to your post  You have done a fine job at using 
 your seventh grade 'life science' course to explain why
 bad diseases are caused by Satan and good things are a 
 result of God  But I want to let you in on a little secret
 We can create an amino acid sequence in lab  And guess
 what the sequence curls into a helix  Wow  That's right
 it can happen without a supernatural force 

Wow  All it takes is a few advanced science degrees and millions
of dollars of state of the art equipment  And I thought it took
intelligence to create the building blocks of life  Foolish me

 People with advanced science degrees use state of the art equipment
and spend millions of dollars to simulate tornadoes But tornadoes
do not require intelligence to exist
 Not only that the equipment needed is not really 'state of the art'
To study the products yes but not to generate them

If you want to be sure that I read your post and to provide a
response send a copy to JimBrownozbmdtrwcom  I can't read

 I don't understand the point of this petty sarcasm It is a basic 
 principle of Islam that if one is born muslim or one says I testify
 that there is no god but God and Mohammad is a prophet of God that
 so long as one does not explicitly reject Islam by word then one must
 be considered muslim by all muslims So the phenomenon you're attempting
 to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic
 Islamic principles If you want to attack Islam you could do better than
 than to argue against something that Islam explicitly contradicts

Then Mr Mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing
bad acts people temporarily become atheists

jon

Of course BM is not incorrect  He is defending Islam  When defending
Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize
you  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using petty sarcasm  So
BM can have his temporary atheists whenever he needs them and all the
temporary atheists can later say that they were always good Muslims because
they never explicitly rejected Islam  

Temporary atheism temporary Islam temporary marriage  None of it sticks  
A teflon religion  How convenient  And so easy to clean up after  But 
then what would you expect from a bunch of people who can't even agree on 
the phases of the moon

This kind of argument cries for a comment

jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom wrote
 In article AprlelandStanfordEDU galahadlelandStanfordEDU Scott Compton writes

Jim you originally wrote
 
 God did not create
 disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns
  
 What God did create was life according to a protein code which is
 mutable and can evolve  Without delving into a deep discussion of
 creationism vs evolutionism God created the original genetic code
 perfect and without flaw 
         

Do you have any evidence for this If the code was once perfect and
has degraded ever since we should have some evidence in favour
of this statement shouldn't we

Perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full
of noncoding regions introns which are so called because they
intervene with the coding regions exons An impressive amount of
evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is
likely that early exons represented early protein domains

Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing It appears that
intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually
have quite similar exonintron structure in their genes 

On the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted
later presents several logical difficulties Introns are removed
by a splicing mechanism  this would have to be present but unused
if introns are inserted Moreover intron insertion would have
required precise targeting  random insertion would not be tolerated
since sequences for intron removal selfsplicing of mRNA are
conserved Besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a
trace  long terminal repeats and target  site duplications and
these are not found in or near intron sequences 

I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and
genetics before posting theological arguments like this 
Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell Lodish
 Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters

 Remember the question was posed in a theological context Why does
 God cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a
 theological perspective  my own  It is no less valid than a purely
 scientific perspective just different

Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas 
theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion
 
 I think you misread my meaning  I said God made the genetic code perfect
 but that doesn't mean it's perfect now  It has certainly evolved since

For the worse Would you please cite a few references that support
your assertion Your assertion is less valid than the scientific
perspective unless you support it by some evidence

In fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps
more important than we've thought  for instance sex might
have evolved as defence against parasites This view is supported by
computer simulations of evolution eg Tierra 
 
 Perhaps  I thought it was higher energy rays like Xrays gamma
 rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage

In fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although
it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action 

 Actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the
 time when God created life  According to my recollection most
 biologists do not claim that life began  billion years ago  after
 all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth
 was created  It would still be too primitive to support life  I
 seem to remember a figure more like  to  billion years ago for
 the origination of life on earth  Anyone with a better estimate

I'd replace created with formed since there is no need to 
invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one
Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between   
billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but
organic stromatolitelike layers date back to  billion years
This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to
evolve

I'm sorry I can't give any references this is based on the course
on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here 

 dominion it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer
 diseases both bacterialviral and genetic  Although the forces of
 natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the
 degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this  

Again do you want this be true or do you have any evidence for
this supposed degeneration 

I can understand Scott's reaction

  Excuse me but this is so farfetched that I know you must be
  jesting  Do you know what pathogens are  Do you know what 
  Point Mutations are  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME
  ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY  
 
 In response to your last statement no and neither do you
 You may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you
 cannot know that

I hope you don't forget this We have evidence that suggests 
everything can come about spontaneously Do you have evidence against
this conclusion In science one does not have to believe in 
anything It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve But the 
right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so
and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this 

Theology does not use this method Therefore I seriously doubt
it could ever come to right conclusions

 Human DNA being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely
 affecting our wellbeing and ability to fight off disease while the 
 simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in 
 causing infection and disease  It is a bad combination  Hence
 we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial
 diseasesdisorders

You are supposing a purpose not a valid move Bacteria and viruses
do not exist to cause disease They are just another manifests of
a general principle of evolution  only replication saves replicators
from degradiation We are just an efficient method for our DNA to 
survive and replicate The less efficient methods didn't make it 
to the present 

And for the last time  Please present some evidence for your claim that
human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes Some people have
claimed that the opposite is true  we have suppressed our selection
and thus are bound to degrade I haven't seen much evidence for either
claim
 
 But then I ask So  Where is this relevant to my discussion in
 answering John's question of why  Why are there genetic diseases
 and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require
 babies to develop antibodies  Is it God's fault the original
 question  I say no it is not

Of course nothing evil is god's fault  But your explanation does
not work it fails miserably
 
 You may be right  But the fact is that you don't know that
 Satan is not responsible and neither do I
 
 Suppose that a powerful evil being like Satan exists  Would it
 be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills
 that affect mankind  I don't think so

He could have done a much better Job Pun intended The problem is
it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are
just as inevitable as any product of evolution

 Did I say that  Where  Seems to me like another bad inference
 Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the
 point that your summary of my words takes on a new context  I
 never said that people are meant presumably by God to be
 punished by getting diseases  Why I did say is that free moral
 choices have attendent consequences  If mankind chooses to reject
 God as people have done since the beginning then they should not
 expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic
 universe

I am not expecting this If god exists I expect him to leave us alone
I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed
free This is an interesting philosophical question and the answer
is not as clearcut as it seems to be

What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah
  
 Oh I admit it's not perfect yet  But I'm working on it  

A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point

 What does this have to do with the price of tea in China or the
 question to which I provided an answer  Biology and Genetics are
 fine subjects and important scientific endeavors  But they explain
 how God created and set up life processes  They don't explain
 the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution

Why is there a why behind And your proposition was something
that is not supported by the evidence This is why we recommend
these books

Is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover Evidence
for this If the whole universe can come into existence without
any intervention as recent cosmological theories Hawking et al
suggest why do people still insist on this
 
 Thanks Scotty for your fine and sagely advice  But I am
 not highly motivated to learn all the nittygritty details
 of biology and genetics although I'm sure I'd find it a
 fascinating subject  For I realize that the details do
 not change the Big Picture that God created life in the
 beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its
 environment

I'm sorry but they do There is no evidence for your big picture
and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation
It can come into existence without a Supreme Being

 Do women have souls in Islam

People have said here that some Muslims say that women do not have
souls  I must admit I have never heard of such a view being held by
Muslims of any era  I have heard of some Christians of some eras
holding this viewpoint but not Muslims  Are you sure you might not be
confusing Christian history with Islamic history

 
Yes it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the Turkish
Caliphate
 

I am not aware of any Turkish Caliphate viewpoint on this Can you
reference

However I found a quote due to Imam Ali whom the Shias follow

Men never obey your women in any way whatsoever Never let them give their
advice on any matter whatsoever even those of everyday life Indeed allow
them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's
wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth
  We see them without religion when alone they are left to their own
devices they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal
desires are at stake It is easy to enjoy them but they cause great
anxiety The most virtious among them are libertines But the most
corrupt are whores Only those of them whom age has deprived of any
charm are untainted by vice They have three qualities particular to
miscreants they complain of being oppressed whereas it is they
who oppress they make oaths whereas they are lying they pretend
to refuse men's solicitations whereas they desire them most ardently
Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds
And preserve us in any case from their good ones

Quote from Mas'ud alQanawi ref A Bouhdiba Sexuality in Islam 
p 

I wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic TM
viewpoint though  For all we know the prophet's cousin and
the Fourth Khalif Hazreti Ali may have said this after a frustrating 
night with a woman

Argument from incredulity has not been considered a valid form of

deletions
Interesting that you should mention that Argument from incredulity has
not been considered a valid form of reasoning since medieval times  I
quite agree  Why then do some atheists here engage in it  More than
a few times I have read posts where the atheists posting state that
they 'cannot see how a gracious and loving God can allow such evil and
suffering to occur as we see on the earth'  Simply because they cannot
envision it it must not be true  If this is not an argument from
incredulity I don't know what is

 As you have presented it it is indeed an argument from incredulity
However from what I have seen it is not often presented in this manner
It is usually presented more in the form And besides I cannot see
nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation
 Moreover it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such
phenomena That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not
an argument in theism's favor Especially when different theisms offer 
different explanations and even different adherents of what is purportedly
the same theism give different explanations

                                    God has far more complex motivations
and reasons for action or nonaction than to simply fix evil whenever
and however it occurs or even before it occurs  And yet it is this
very same argument from incredulity which ranks high among reasons
why atheists in general reject God and in particular the Christian God

 Not im my experience In my experience the most common reason is the
lack of evidence in theism's favor You mileage may vary 

This seems to be the universal bane of human reasoning and rationality 
to wit that it is far easier to see the logical fallacy or inept reasoning 
on the part of one's opponents than it is to see it in oneself

 Oh heck I'll be snide this once  It's also fairly easy to attack
arguments that are not made Ie 'strawmen'

As one Man of Wisdom put it take the log out of your own eye before you 
try to remove the splinter from your neighbor's eye

 Sage advice indeed

potential criminals like Communists and atheists

Sorry I don't follow your reasoning  You are proposing to punish people
before they commit a crime  What justification do you have for this

No Mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism not treating the
electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer What he is saying is that
the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential
criminals  This may not on the surface sound like a bad thing but who
defines what a potential criminal is If the government of the day decides
that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal
then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice this is not
conducive to a free society

Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people
is an impropriety upon that person regardless of what type of crime or
what chance of recidivism there is Basically you see the criminal justice
system as a punishment for the offender and possibly therefore a deterrant
to future offenders Mathew sees it most probably as a means of
rehabilitation for the offender So he was being cynical at you okay

 Okay  So you want me to name names  There are obviously no official
 records of these pseudomarriages because they are performed for
 convenience  What happens typically is that the woman is willing to move
 in with her lover without any scruples or legal contracts to speak of 
 The man is merely utilizing a loophole by entering into a temporary
 religious marriage contract in order to have sex  Nobody complains
 nobody cares nobody needs to know
 
 Perhaps you should alert your imam  It could be that this practice is
 far more widespread than you may think  Or maybe it takes  muslim men
 to witness the penetration to decide if the practice exists
  
 
 
 Again you astound me with the level of ignorance you display Muslims
 are NOT allowed to enter temporary marriages got that There is
 no evidence for it it an outlawed practise so get your facts 
 straight buddy Give me references for it or just tell everyone you
 were lying It is not a widespread as you may think fantasise in
 fact contrary to your fantasies it is not practised at all amongst
 Muslims

Did you miss my post on this topic with the quote from The Indonesian
Handbook and Fred Rice's comments about temporary marriages  If so 
I will be glad to repost them  Will you accept that it just may be 
a practice among some Muslims if I do  Or will you continue to claim
that we are all lying and that it is not practised at all amongst Muslims

I don't think F Karner has to tell everyone anything  Least of all that
he is lying

Since you obviously know nothing about this practice there is very little
you can contribute to the discussion except to accuse everyone of lying
Perhaps it is your ignorance which is showing  Learn more about Islam
Learn more about Muslims  Open your eyes  Maybe you will also see some
of the things the atheists see

Not any more so than

      holding people against their will is wrong
      if you hold people against their will we will punish you
      our punishment will be to hold you against your will

Is there any punishment which isn't something which if done by a private
person to another private person for no apparent reason would lead to
punishment  Fines I suppose

 God is eternal    A  B
 Jesus is God      C  A
 Therefore Jesus is eternal  C  B

 This works both logically and mathematically  God is of the set of
 things which are eternal  Jesus is a subset of God   Therefore
 Jesus belongs to the set of things which are eternal

The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity
statements since the is in those statements is the is of predication
rather than of identity  Instead they should be translated using a
predicate letter  Using g to designate God and j to designate Jesus
and the predicate letter E for the property of being eternal the
first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej
    The second premise appears to contain an is of identity in which
case it can be properly symbolized as j  g  But your remark that Jesus
is a subset of God suggests that strict identity is not desired here
If however the first premise means that all members making up the set
God have the property of being eternal the same conclusion follows

If all of those are is's of identity both syllogisms are valid

There are at least twenty instances of this kind of muddleheaded fourth

the instances could be counted because they reproduce like a virus the more

	a study them dispassionately and figure out how they work then
 remember what you've learned so as to combat them when they or their clones

This posting is totally uncalled for in recscouting

The point has been raised and has been answered  Roger and I have
clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue
specifically that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of
the Scout Oath specifically the promise to live morally straight

There is really nothing else to discuss  Trying to cloud the issue
with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless
because it's like comparing apples to oranges ie people can't
control their race but they can control their behavior

What else is there to possibly discuss on recscouting on this issue
Nobody including BSA is denying anybody the right to live andor
worship as they please or don't please  but it doesn't mean that BSA
is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized positive religious
and moral standards on which our society has been established and on
which it should continue to be based

 There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of
 both atheists AND theists    Perhaps since I'm a bit weak on
 history somone here would like to give a list of wars causedled by
 theists 

This thread seems to be arguing the validity of a religious viewpoint
according to some utilitarian principle ie atheismreligion is
wrong because it causes death  The underlying moral' is that death
is wrong'  This is a rather arbitrary measure of validity

Get some epistemology

     There is no means that i can possibly think of to prove beyond doubt
that a god does not exist but if anyone has one by all means tell me
what it is  Therefore lacking this ability of absolute proof being an
atheist becomes an act of faith in and of itself and this I cannot accept
 I accept nothing on blind faith
 
Invisible Pink Flying Unicorns  Need I say more
 
I harbor no beliefs at all there is no good evidence for god
existing or not  Some folks call this agnosticism  It does not suffer
from blind faith at all  I think of it as Don't worry be happy
 
For many atheists the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an
epistemological consideration  what do we accept as a reliable way of
knowing  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence
of gods nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist  Most
philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that
must be accepted on faith  Faith is belief without a sound logical
basis or empirical evidence  It is a reliable way of knowing
 
There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence
of any possibility of proof  Even when we agree to take someone elses
word on faith we just mean that having found this person to be
reliable in the past we judge him likely to be a reliable source now
If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence
everywhere else why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about
gods
 
The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then
one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing
rather than as some agnostic posters would have it whether ones faith
is in gods or no gods  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable
basis for a belief in gods even if he rejects faith as reliable at
other times for example in his work as a scientist  The atheist
believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable
knowledge  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than
theism or atheism unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other
knowledge  Without evidence why should we believe in gods rather than
Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny
 
I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't
require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods  I don't believe that
there is any such thing as absolute knowledge  Atheism is the best and
simplest theory to fit the lack of facts and so should be held until
contrary evidence is found

Let me see if I understand what you are saying  In order to talk 
knowledgeably about religion Atheists must first have been so immersed 
in a religion that only the rare individual could have left  

No you don't understand  I said that I don't think people can discuss
the subjective merits of religion objectively  This should be obvious
People here have said that everyone would be better off without religion
but this almost certainly isn't true

But really are you threatened by the motto or by the people that use it
The motto is a tool  Let's try to take away the tool

But guns and axes are tools both of which have been used for murder
Should both be taken away  That is to say I don't think motto misuse
warrants its removal  At least not in this case

I somewhat agree with u  However what it comes to theist religion 
it's a different matter  That's because religion is like a drug once u
use it it's very difficult to get out of it  That's because in
order to experience a religion u necessarily have to have blind faith
and once u have the blind faith it's very diffcult for you to reason
yourself back to atheism again
Therefore it's unreasonable to ask people to try religion in order to
judge it  It's like asking people to try dying to find out what
death is like

Well now we can't judge death until we are dead right  So why should
we judge religion without having experienced it  People have said that
religion is bad by any account and that it is in no way useful etc
but I don't totally agree with this  Of course we cannot really say
how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion
but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it

So basically we can not judge whether religion is the right route for
a given individual or even for a general population  We can say that
it is not best for us personally at least you can choose not to use
religionmight be hard to try to find out its benefits as you state
above

I was looking for a rigorous definition because otherwise we would be
spending the rest of our lives arguing what a Christian really
believes

I don't think we need to argue about this

KSDo you think that the motto points out that this country is proud
KSof its freedom of religion and that this is something that
KSdistinguishes us from many other countries
MWNo
KSWell your opinion is not shared by most people I gather
Perhaps not but that is because those seeking to make government
recognize Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do not
think they are infringing on the rights of others who do not share
their beliefs

Yes but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize
Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think
the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their
beliefs

And actually I think that the government already does recognize that
Christianity is the dominant religion in this country  I mean it is
Don't you realizerecognize this

This isn't to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of
Christianity just that most people do

Like I've said before I personally don't think the motto is a major
concern

If you agree with me then what are we discussing

KSSince most people don't seem to associate Christmas with Jesus much
KSanymore I don't see what the problem is
Can you prove your assertion that most people in the US don't
associate Christmas with Jesus anymore

No but I hear quite a bit about Christmas and little if anything about
Jesus  Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really
associated to a high degree with him  Or are you saying that the
association with Jesus is on a personal level and that everyone thinks
about it but just never talks about it

That is can you prove that most people do associate Christmas
most importantly with Jesus

Anyways the point again is that there are people who do associate
Christmas with Jesus It doesn't matter if these people are a majority
or not

I think the numbers do matter  It takes a majority or at least a
majority of those in power to discriminate  Doesn't it

 The probability that the automobile system will kill someone 
 innocent in an accident goes asymptotically close to  just 
 like the court system
However anyone who doesn't like the automobile system can
opt out as I have

This isn't true  Many people are forced to use the automobile system
I certainly don't use it by choice  If there were other ways of getting
around I'd do it

Secondly we do try to make the automobile system as safe
as possible because we do recognize the danger to the 
innocent whereas the US  the current example  is not trying
to make the Court System safer which it could fairly easily
do by replacing fatal punishments with nonfatal punishments

But I think that the Court system has been refinedover hundreds of

MVSpsuvmpsuedu writes

Many people would probably think especially if the fanatics propogandized
this that this was a conflict between the atheists and the religious
Many would get the impression that we were trying to outlaw religion if
we contintue to try to remove all things with a religious reference
That's not what the people I've asked think Perhaps you would be right
if you said the fundamentalists would think this way after all they think
they are being oppressed when they are not allowed to oppress However
you have not shown where you get this idea that 'many' people would
'probably' think it's atheism vs religion winner take all As far as I can
tell it is your groundless prediction that this will happen

But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda  Remember if you
asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered they would
probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at
least some were able to tolerate it

You see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general
frenzy

THe propoganda machines have been in gear over a number of issues including
abortion and gays  look at some of the things that have happened
Well so far they have passed one amendment which is currently under
intense scrutiny and they have failed to outlaw abortion which is their
prime goal on that issue Yep they seem sooo effective Sure

Well they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity
of the courts  But they have managed to create quite a few problems for
people that wanted to have an abortion  They could create similar problems
for us  And it could be worse  They can try to stop abortions by blocking
clinics etc but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism

Besides the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people
Better than your one that is your opinion Also I have branched
out and the informal survey is up over half a dozen now
And what have they said  Were you questions unbiased
Keith you would claim that my questions are biased the minute I posted
them because the answers agreed with me Everyone I have asked about
the possible removal of the motto the christian portion has expressed
regret about its loss because they like it However when it is pointed
out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed
the desire to rape murder pillage etc which you have basically claimed

So you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a
whole room of them  A whole nation

As for the atheist portion I know some around here they have all
expressed disgust with the motto Some noted being harassed by christians
who used the motto to try to seem justified And all would see it gone

Yes I'd be glad if it were gone to  I've never supported it  However
I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted
with what could happen an what may be likely

Which Christians designed the motto  Does the motto say anything about
Jesus  Why do you think that it refers only to Christians
Christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and
all others are wrong therefore why would they 'include' other religions
in the realm of being correct I doubt that any other religions were meant
to be included

Well I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key the
motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed
in a god  And surely there are a few Christians that think as you say
but I don't think that most do  Do you think that all Christians actively
despise other religions  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so

No christian
that I have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them
Why not ask some people of other faiths
Sorry I would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here
Suppose you could ask a few people

Well I have asked a Hindu Moselem and a few Jews and all of them think
that it is applicable to them  Of course I can't say that these people
just some that I know pretty well are accurate representations of their
faiths

It is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any
given issue  You are assuming that all the views were the same and nothing
leads to this conclusion
Without evidence to the contrary I doubt that there were dissenting
opinions You claim there were Provide some evidence for your assertion

Well I'd really like to and I've tried but I really don't know where to
get access to Congressional Records from the 's  Can anyone help
out here

Comparing christians to Nazis Interesting

Only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs

No again the motto on the money doesn't cost you anything extra  However
if you abolished the motto we'd all have to pay to have all the dies and
plates redone
Like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them
You now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again

 Also I doubt that they use th
same plates for more than a year's printing this would make it easy
to remove the motto simply make next year's plates without it Your
claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere
Provide some evidence for this assertion

So are you saying that they redesign the plates each year

Anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted I see was that the motto
somehow costs us all a lot of money  This is just not correct

The ones I read didn't mention anything about Jesus  I think the issue was
concerning the distinction between religion and not
How could it be between religious and not religious The motto
refers to god it is a religious motto The question is whether or
not it is only christian You say it is more I doubt this Provide
some evidence for this assertion

That is to say the religion of this country and the nonreligion of
the USSR  That was what most of those quotes were about and some included
all atheists in general as well  I don't think that any of the quotes
although I seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about Jesus
They advocated religion over nonreligion  A specific religion was not
mentioned

You have missed this point  I said that the motto didn't say anything
about anyone in particular  That is the motto doesn't imply anything
about your particular beliefs  It doesn't say that everyone trusts
in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does
We have been through this before It's obvious it does not include me
this much is beyond doubt Your claim again is that the motto refers
to more than christians Based on the facts that christianity says all
other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was
written by christians I doubt your claim

So you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions
should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong  That's silly
I think the FlatEarthers are wrong but I don't advocate their banishment

  Based on this idea I doubt that any additional expense would
even be incurred by removing the motto Provide some evidence for your
claim that it would

I think that any such cost would be insignificant  I mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
being on our currency

Disregarding the digression of the other mottoIf it is used for
harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should
it not be removed

Well mottos in general don't really have purposes  I don't think it
should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the
consequences

And do you know what the vote was  Were there other opinions  Do you
think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother
atheists  Do you think that this is what the majority of congress at
the time had in mind  If you do then show why
Again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that I am
concerned with

Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress

Again it is not necessary that the complete majority
shared the purpose of confronting 'godless Communism' with this motto

Why not  It is the majority that put it there

The general public probably does not know about the antiatheist intent
of a few people in the 's either
I daresay more people remember the 's than the time when Key wrote
the anthem

But do they remember the debate surrounding the motto  Do they remember
that some people intended it to be a message against atheists  Why don't
you include this in your little survey that you were conducting


You claim here that scientists would believe someone's claims I doubt
this Provide evidence for your assertion

What  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein
said about relativity is worthy  I mean if Einstein said it there's a
good chance that it was right at least at the time

As for the courts the
method scientists use can be applied I need not agree with the court
by default because of a 'good record'

You need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think
that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point

What  But you said you didn't agree with the court because they allowed
Congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning  If
you don't realize that something like this is external to the realm of
the court's power then how can I be confident that you know anything
about the court's powers  I mean if you don't know how the court works
how can you participate in a discussion of the court
A judge can go to speak before Congress And still you ignore the
abortion gag rule as you make your claims on abortion

No I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court
Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a
Constitutional Amendment

And in order for the Court to rule on something a case usually must be
presented

Mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever  the analogy is
the same  Just because something that I might find offensive is present
doesn't mean that my rights are being violated
We are talking about something put there by people Keithnot
a mushroom No one caused that mushroom to exist unless you're
finding things offensive in a mushroom farm

Yes some mushrooms can be planted  And I don't appreciate mushrooms on
my pizza either

This is not the case
with the motto And you're ignoring the harassment which is the
only known result of the motto and you're ignoring that somewhere
along the line people were forced to put the motto there

Who was forced to put the motto there  What do you mean

That is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction  It is not sound

Another possible interpretation of what you wrote is

There exists at least one car called Mercedes

As far as I know tigers are not sentient  If I were pushed into a pool with
some dolphins and they attacked me I might be inclined to blame the dolphins
rather than the person doing the pushing as a dolphins are not usually
aggressive and b they seem to have welldeveloped brains and a capacity for

As a matter of fact tigers rarely attack humans unless the human provokes

 My opinion is that the strong atheist position requires too much

 care to comment 

 Humans just come up with the idea of a spiritual parent It is one
 of the artifacts of human thought The evidence for that is quite
 overwhelming And the information content of the conceived is vanishing
  
 In other words if there were gods they would hardly make sense and
 it is possible to explain the phenomenon of religion without gods
  
 The concept is useless and I don't have to introduce new assumptions
 in order to show that
  
 No leap of faith required for me Your mileage may vary

Yes I fully agree with that but is it I don't believe gods exist or
I believe no gods exist As MANDTBACKAFINABOABOFI Mats Andtbacka
pointed out it all hinges on what you take the word believe to mean

Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak
atheism at least according to the FAQ

 Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God
 Some atheists go further and believe that God does not exist  The former is
 often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong
 atheism
 
 It is important to note the difference between these two positions  Weak
 atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of God  Strong
 atheism is a positive belief that God does not exist  Please do not
 fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists

 I don't understand the point of this petty sarcasm It is a basic 
 principle of Islam that if one is born muslim or one says I testify
 that there is no god but God and Mohammad is a prophet of God that
 so long as one does not explicitly reject Islam by word then one must
 be considered muslim by all muslims So the phenomenon you're attempting
 to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic
 Islamic principles If you want to attack Islam you could do better than
 than to argue against something that Islam explicitly contradicts

      In the deletions somewhere it mentioned something about chopping
off of hands being a punishment for theft in Saudi Arabia Assuming this
is so I wouldn't know and assuming it is done by people fitting your
requirement for muslim which I find highly likely then would you
please try to convince Bobby Mozumder that muslims chop people's hands
off

Will is selfdetermination  In other words God created conscious
beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently
of God  All will therefore is free will

The above is probably not the most representative paragraph but I
thought I'd hop on anyway

What strikes me as selfcontradicting in the fable of Lucifer's
fall  which by the way I seem to recall to be more speculation
than based on biblical text but my ex RCism may be showing  is
that as Benedikt pointed out Lucifer had perfect nature yet he
had the free will to choose evil  But where did that choice come
from

We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a
tempter which many assume was Satan but how did Lucifer discover
invent create call the action what you will something that God
had not given origin to

Also where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will
We make a big fuss about mankind having free will but it strikes me
as being an afterthefact rationalisation and in fact like
salvation not one that all Christians believe in identically

At least in my mind salvation and free will are very tightly
coupled but then my theology was Roman Catholic

Still how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall  If Lucifer had
perfect nature did man how could he fall  How could he execute an
act that a contradicted his nature and b in effect cause evil to
exist for the first time

My opinion is that the strong atheist position requires too much
belief for me to be comfortable with Any strong atheists out there
care to comment As far as I can tell strong atheists are far
outnumbered on altatheism by weak atheists

At the cost of repudiating the FAQ I think too much is made of the
strong vs weak atheism issue although in the context of altatheism
where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists
believe in the nonexistence of god I think the separation is a
valid one

To cover my arse what I'm trying to say is that there is an
infinitely grey area between weak and strong as well as between
strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism I wish  Whereas I
logically can only support the weak atheist position in effect I am
a strong atheist and wish I could be a mathematical one  To
justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that
the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny
is faulty

If I read the FAQ correctly no argument for the existence of god
generic as represented by mainstream theologians has ever been
found to be unassailable  To me this is adequate evidence that the
realgod is undefinable or at least no definition has yet been
found to be watertight which in turn I accept as sufficient to
base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god

I'm a little fuzzy on the edges though so opinions are welcome
but perhaps we should change the thread subject

 Why would the Rushdie case be particularly legitimate As I've said
 elsewhere on this issue Rushdie's actions had effects in Islamic
 countries so that it is not so simple to say that he didn't commit
 a crime in an Islamic country

Actually it is simple

A person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders
of X at the time when C was committed  It doesn't matter if the physical
manifestation of C is outside X

For instance if I hack into NASA's Ames Research Lab and delete all their
files I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom  If the US authorities
wish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law they have no automatic
right to do so

This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites
in Holland  Holland had no anticracking legislation and so it was viewed
as a hacker haven by some US system administrators

Similarly a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic
material which can be received in Britain  If they were broadcasting in
Britain they would be committing a crime  But they are not they are
broadcasting from Denmark so the British Government is powerless to do
anything about it in spite of the apparent lawbreaking

Of course I'm not a lawyer so I could be wrong  More confusingly I could
be right in some countries but not in others

No Gregg you cannot say A is lenient and A punishes severely in public
Unless of course it is one of the exceptions implied by almost all
matters

That depends on the statistics and who is punished in public If some
power for example nothing Islamic about it allows men to rape women
five times before blowing the rapist's head off in public then I'd call
that leniency wouldn't you

 
You have given that example It is not lenient End of argument
 
And chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either It
rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system
without checking if they suit the description
 
And wasn't the argument that it takes five men to rape a woman according
to Islamic law
 
 
While I don't approve of it I think both the prostitute and the customer
have the right to do what they do In other words punishing them is a
violation of their rights And to punish them severely in public is just
another pointer to the hysteria connected with sexuality in so many
religions

Believe what you like

 
No I even believe what I don't like Can you give better answers than that
Have you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims
 
 
In this case I don't see why I should accept the complex ridden views
of an oriental goatherd

Ah yes I forget that the West is historically so much without sexual
neurosis 

Oriental goatherd really intellectual

 
A fact if memory serves And most will see the connection between the
primitive machism in the Orient and in Islam
 
If people agree on having sex it is fine And I would assume that a
god would have a clue of what the detrimental effects of supressing it
are

Huh Ever heard of AIDs Of course you'll probably go on to say that
God must be evil because he allows the disease to exist bla bla

 
As usually you miss the point Aids is  neither spread only through sex
nor necessarily spread by having sex Futher the point is a very important
point the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS It is even
stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex The
consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids
Please note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex
is not controlled is completely counterfactual

Bigots never concede that their bigotry is irrational it
is other people who determine that by examining their arguments

No  I  expected it You've set yourself up a wonderful little
world where a bigot is whomever you say it is  This is very 
comfortable for youimagine never having to entertain an
argument against your belief system  Simply accuse the person
making of being a bigot  

Well this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over
into altatheism where we spend most of our time entertaining
arguments against our belief system without resorting to accusing
others of bigotry  It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry
happens in this instance to have originated in recscouting since I
always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity  I
understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who
happen to be of a different race religion ethnic background sex or
other inconsequential characteristics  All the evidence I've seen
indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are
exactly such inconsequential characteristics  Thus pending further
evidence I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people
are bigots and organizations that exclude such people are
discriminatory

I will argue that your latter statement I believe that no gods exist
does rest upon faith  that is if you are making a POSITIVE statement
that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying I don't
know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then
weak atheism Once again to not believe in God is different than saying
I BELIEVE that God does not exist I still maintain the position even
after reading the FAQs that strong atheism requires faith

 
No it in the way it is usually used In my view you are saying here that
driving a car requires faith that the car drives
 
For me it is a conclusion and I have no more faith in it than I have in the
premises and the argument used
 
 
But first let me say the following
We might have a language problem here  in regards to faith and
existence I as a Christian maintain that God does not exist
To exist means to have being in space and time God does not HAVE
being  God IS Being Kierkegaard once said that God does not
exist He is eternal With this said I feel it's rather pointless
to debate the so called existence of God  and that is not what
I'm doing here I believe that God is the source and ground of
being When you say that god does not exist I also accept this
statement  but we obviously mean two different things by it However
in what follows I will use the phrase the existence of God in it's
'usual sense'  and this is the sense that I think you are using it
I would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of
God

 
No that's a word game The term god is used in a different way usually
When you use a different definition it is your thing but until it is
commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is  and
that does not exist it is existence itself so I say it does not exist
 
Interestingly there are those who say that existence exists is one of
the indubitable statements possible
 
Further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is
already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are implying
more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far
are incomplete making it a fallacy
 
 
Deletion
One can never prove that God does or does not exist When you say
that you believe God does not exist and that this is an opinion
based upon observation I will have to ask what observtions are
you refering to There are NO observations  pro or con  that
are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief
Deletion
 
Where does that follow Aren't observations based on the assumption
that something exists
 
And wouldn't you say there is a level of definition that the assumption
god is is meaningful If not I would reject that concept anyway
 
So where is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some level

This frayed thread has turned into a patented altatheism on
pingpong game and I don't have any strong disagreement so I'll try
to stick to the one thing I don't quite follow about the argument

It seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the Bible
was enlightened for its times ie closer to what we would consider
morally good based on our standards and past experience on the one
hand I hope this summarizes this argument adequately and on the
other hand

In article Aprwatsonibmcom stromWatsonIbmCom Rob Strom writes
In article phpeINNgdsidsinccom perrydsinccom Jim Perry writes

 Disclaimer  I'm speaking from the Jewish perspective
 where the Bible means what many call the Old Testament
 and where the interpretation is not necessarily the
 raw text but instead the court cases commentaries
 and traditions passed down through Jewish communities
 
 This seems the crux to me if you judge the Bible according to a long
 line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day
 rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact then of course
 it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values

But if that's how the Bible is actually being used today
shouldn't that be how we should judge it  If most people
use scissors to cut paper shouldn't Consumer's Reports
test scissors for papercutting ability even though
scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth

That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching
Jewish morality today but it hardly seems fair to claim that this
highlyinterpreted version is what was enlightened for its times
To attempt to extend the analogy this is like saying that the
original scissormakers were unusually advanced at papercutting for
their times even though they only ever cut cloth and had never even
heard of paper

I'm not arguing that the Bible is disgusting though some of the
history depicted in it is by modern standards  However history is
full of similar abuses and I don't think the Biblical accounts are
worse than their contemporariesor possibly ours  On the other hand
I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible
shows less abuse than their contemporaries or ours  That complex
and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic
interpretations of that history is interesting but I still don't
think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it
to attack condemnation of the original history

As for rape surely there the burden of guilt is solely on the rapist
Unless you force someone to live with the rapist against his will in which
case part of the responsibility is yours
I'm sorry but I can't accept that  Unless the rapist was hypnotized or
something I view him as solely responsible for his actions

Not necessarily especially if the rapist is known as such  For instance
if you intentionally stick your finger into a loaded mousetrap and get
snapped whose fault is it

There is really nothing else to discuss

Apparently not

In response to his claim that it terrifies gay people not to be able
to indoctrinate children to our lifestyle or words to that effect
I sent Roger a very calm carefullywritten detailed letter
explaining simply why the BSA policy does indeed terrify me  I did
not use inflammatory language and left myself extremely open for an
answer  Thus far I have not received an answer  I can conclude only
that Roger considers his position either indefensible or simply not
worth defending

Trying to cloud the issue
with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless
because it's like comparing apples to oranges ie people can't
control their race but they can control their behavior

In fact that's exactly the point people can control their behavior
Because of that fact there is no need for a blanket ban on
homosexuals

What else is there to possibly discuss on recscouting on this issue

You tell me

The thread Biblical Rape was initiated by David O Hunt
Here is his posting
In article feuKOXsFkpcpandrewcmuedu David O Hunt bluelobsterCMUEDU writes
 I'm pretty sure I've seen biblical rules for when it's allowable to rape
 prisoners what the codes are about that etc  Could some more
 knowledgable soul than I please let me know some references

He asked a very narrow question and I gave a very narrow answer

 
Yes sorry I have got that wrong My apology
 
 
Deletion
 
No David Hunt's post didn't mention a god nor did my response
You were the first to bring up the idea of the Bible being given
by god  Most Jews don't believe this in any literal sense

 
So No fun but I must have met the minority then
And given by god refers to any action whereby a god
god causes or better effects something
 
 
Rob I am not intimate with Jewish theology but I understand
that you are a Messianic Jew Correct me if I am wrong but
it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics
is different to that of the majority of Jews While Jewish
theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god
views I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute
evil to their god an nono for Christians the Bible is
still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man
 
 
Deletion
No  I thought we agreed that though Jews disagree
there are a set of core beliefs that they do agree upon
one of which is that the commandments are accessible
and written in the language of the time and another
of which is that there must be a legal system to update them

 
The context was metaphysics even when the process of adapting
the commandments is not transcendent the justification of the
process lie in metaphysic specualtion I wonder how you break
out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system
 
 
Deletion
Could you explain this with respect to the original commandments
being discussed  that is the commandment that says if
you feel like raping a woman prisoner you should instead
wait and marry her  What about the way this commandment
is given invalidates it

 
Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other
reprehensible deeds The context is repulsive and it is
foul play IMO to invoke some relatively enlightened passages
as an example for the content of the whole book
 
 
Big deletion

 The point is that I see that there is a necessary connection
 between the theology you use and the interpretation of the Bible


Only very loosely  My interpretation of the Bible is
based on a long tradition of Jewish scholars interpreting
the Bible  Theology doesn't really enter into it 
there are Jewish atheists who interpret the laws of
charity essentially the same way I do

 
No not the interpretation of some laws but the interpretation of
the bible As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue
with god The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows
you to argue with a god whatever that means that alone is a theo
logic question is proof of a theology used
 
 
 You pose another metaphysical riddle

 No you do


Well you wrote this
 Fine So we have some major spirit with neither absolute power
 nor absolute knowledge And as it appears limited means or will
 to communicate with us Some form of spiritual big friend
 Do you admit that using god in this context is somewhat unusual

 Am I right in the assumption that it cannot have created the
 universe as well And that the passages in the Bible referring
 to that or its omnipotence are crap

That's what I meant by the riddle

 
It is an important question in the light of what for instance the
passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means Either there is some connection
between the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation of
it or it is purely arbitrary Further the question is why is has
one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write
other books that convey the message better You might answer that one
can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost but
that holds true of every other book and the question remains why has
the Bible still a special place Can't it be replaced somehow Is it
ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other
message that is included as well
 
 
Deletion
 Do you see the danger in doing so Especially with the metaphers used
 in the Bible

I think the danger of doing so is less than either the
danger of having a frozen system of laws or having no laws

 
Sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about if
one could not have a better system
 
Deletion
If we
read two stories about the importance of helping the poor
and in one God is a spirit and in the other God has a body
which is more important helping the poor or resolving
the contradiction about the corporeal nature of God

 
If we read two stories in the Bible one that god commands people
to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills
children directly what is more important to resolve the message that
children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god
 
 
And the argument you have given is a fallacy while it may not be important
in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not it
can be crucial in other questions Religious believers resolve contradictions
with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way
and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some
god
 
One cannot resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what
is good depends on the question

 In other words if there were gods they would hardly make sense and
 it is possible to explain the phenomenon of religion without gods

 The concept is useless and I don't have to introduce new assumptions
 in order to show that

Yes I fully agree with that but is it I don't believe gods exist or
I believe no gods exist As MANDTBACKAFINABOABOFI Mats Andtbacka
pointed out it all hinges on what you take the word believe to mean

 
For me it is a I believe no gods exist and a I don't believe gods exist
 
In other words I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere
with this world are false or meaningless In Ontology one can fairly
conclude that when A exist is meaningless A does not exist Under the
Pragmatic definition of truth A exists is meaningless makes A exist
even logically false
 
A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god
by definition and there might be cases where a subjective god would even
make sense The trouble with most god definitions is that they include
some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting
all Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others

Ahhhhh but that is the point   Honor should demand that each of them
recognize that there is errorfaultmisunderstanding aplenty in the
situation and to apologize to each other

But since there is no honor between the two of them they hold to
their own thickheaded paths refusing to recognize each other as human

Honor is both an individual trait and a contract between two or more

    Fatti Maschii Parole Femine

which if you read Italian says

    Manly deeds womanly words

or something to that effect  In the state which not so long ago had four
women out of seven representatives this represents a problem  The official
solution was to change the translation so now it means

    Strong deeds gentle words

My personal suggestion was changing it to walk softly and carry a big

So then you require the same amount of evidence to believe that I 
a own a pair of bluejeans and b have superhuman powers

Well I could use the argument that some here use about nature and claim
that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human superhuman
powers are beyond what a human has and since you are a human any powers
you have are not beyond those of a human  Hence you cannot have superhuman
powers  Sound good to you

Anyway to the evidence question it depends on the context  In this group
since you are posting from a american college site I'm willing to take it
as given that you have a pair of blue jeans  And assuming there is some
coherency in your position I will take it as a given that you do not have
superhuman powers  Arguments are evidence in themselves in some respects

When you say the existence of  sic  Jesus I assume that you 
mean just the man without any special powers etc

Yep

Many will agree that it is very possible that a man called Jesus DID 
in fact live In fact I am willing to agree that there was some man named 
Jesus I have no reason to believe that there wasn't ever a man

Good

However most of the claims ARE extradinary eg virgin birth 
 virgin in the sense of not having any sexual intercourse  resurection 
Son of God etc THOSE claims require extra evidence

Extra evidence  Why don't we start with evidence at all

I cannot see any evidence for the V B which the cynics in this group would
ever accept  As for the second it is the foundation of the religion
Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus back in the  day period
is a believer and therefore is discounted by those in this group since
these are all ancients anyway one again to choose to dismiss the whole
thing  The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else
even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it means so
again I don't see how evidence is possible

I thus interpret the extraordinary claims claim as a statement that the
speaker will not accept any evidence on the matter

Benedikt Rosenau writes

The argument goes as follows Qoid quotes appear in John but not in
the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke However they are
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such and
not an entirely different source

Assuming you are presenting it accurately I don't see how this argument
really leads to any firm conclusion  The material in John I'm not sure
exactly what is referred to here but I'll take for granted the similarity
to the MattLuke Q material IS different hence one could have almost
any relationship between the two right up to John getting it straight from
Jesus' mouth

We are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors The usual
explanation for the time order of Mark Matthew and Luke does not consider
their respective ages It says Matthew has read the text of Mark and Luke
that of Matthew and probably that of Mark

The version of the usual theory I have heard has Matthew and Luke
independently relying on Mark and Q  One would think that if Luke relied
on Matthew we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies
for one thing

As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text The evidence
for that is not overwhelming admittedly

This is the part that is particularly new to me  If it were possible that
you could point me to a reference I'd be grateful

Unfortunately I haven't got the info at hand  It was I think in the late
's or early 's and it was possibly as old as CE 

When they are from about  why do they shed doubt on the order on
putting John after the rest of the three

Because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing
copy quit a bit  The further away from the original the more copies can be
written and therefore survival becomes more probable

And I don't think a one step removed source is that bad  If Luke and Mark
and Matthew learned their stories directly from diciples then I really
cannot believe in the sort of big transformation from Jesus to gospel that
some people posit  In news reports one generally gets no better
information than this

And if John IS a diciple then there's nothing more to be said

That John was a disciple is not generally accepted The style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument

I'm not really impressed with the theology argument  But I'm really
pointing this out as an if  And as I pointed out earlier one cannot make
these arguments about I Peter I see no reason not to accept it as an
authentic letter


One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times Compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies

The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is
not so bad

In other words one does not know what the original of Mark did look like
and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak

But the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case it's
agreed that the most important epistles predate Mark

And what about that revelation thing Charley

If you're talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well
it's obviously a risk one takes

Many people say that the concept of metaphysical and religious knowledge
is contradictive

I'm not an objectivist so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of
conceptualization  The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of
trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary
experience  One can get some rough understanding but the language is from
the perspective of ordinary phenomena inconsistent and from the
perspective of what's being described rather inexact to be charitable

An analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is
that the better descriptive language is not available

And in case it holds reliable information can you show how you establish
that

This word reliable is essentially meaningless in the context unless you
can show how reliability can be determined

      There is no means that i can possibly think of to prove beyond doubt

 I harbor no beliefs at all there is no good evidence for god

 For many atheists the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an
 epistemological consideration  what do we accept as a reliable way of
 knowing  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence
 of gods nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist  Most
 philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that
 must be accepted on faith  Faith is belief without a sound logical
 basis or empirical evidence  It is a reliable way of knowing
  

Could you expand on your definition of knowing It seems a bit monolithic
here but I'm not sure that you intend that Don't we need for example to
distinguish between knowing  plus  equals  or  apples plus  apples
equals  apples the French knowing that Jerry Lewis is an auteur and
what it means to say we know what Socrates said

For several years I've periodically asked Charley Wingate to explain this
mythical alternative to rationality which he propounds so enthusiastically
when he pops up every few months  His reluctance to explain indicates to me
that it's not so hot

I've said enough times that there is no alternative that should think you
might have caught on by now  And there is no alternative but the point
is rationality isn't an alternative either  The problems of metaphysical
and religious knowledge are unsolvable or I should say humans cannot
solve them

If there is truly no alternative then you have no basis whatsoever
for your claim  The usual line here which you call a prejudgment of
atheism and dispute is that reason is all we have  Here you admit
that you have no alternative no possible basis for the claim that
there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in
religious knowledge except possibly that reason conflicts with
religious knowledge

This sounds very much like I can't provide a rational defense for my
belief but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it
may be false  I hope it makes you happy but your repeated and
unfounded assertions to this effect don't advance your cause

And what about that revelation thing Charley

If you're talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well
it's obviously a risk one takes

 Ah now here is the core question Let me suggest a scenario

 We will grant that a God exists and uses revelation to communicate
with humans Said revelation taking the form paraphrased from your
own words 'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck
makes him take dictation and then hides away for a few hundred years'
 Now there exists a human who has not personally experienced a
revelation This person observes that not only do these revelations seem
to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the
observed world which is all this person has ever seen but there are
many mutually contradictory claims of revelation

 Now based on this can this person be blamed for concluding absent
a personal revelation of their own that there is almost certainly
nothing to this 'revelation' thing

I'm not an objectivist so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of
conceptualization  The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of
trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary

perspective of what's being described rather inexact to be charitable

An analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is
that the better descriptive language is not available

 Absent this better language and absent observations in support of the
claims of revelation can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing

 Here is what I am driving at I have thought a long time about this I
have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity it is
nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with
 Now if there does happen to be say a Christian God will I be held
accountable for such an honest mistake

deleted to get to the point
 
 Therefore in a nutshell my opinion is that premarital sex makes the
 likelihood of extramarital sex more probable  Furthermore
 in my opinion extramarital sex helps break down partnerships and leads
 to greater divorce rates  This in turn in my opinion creates trauma
 and a less stable environment for children who are then in my opinion
 more likely to grow up with psychological problems such as depression
 etc  And thus sex outside of marriage is in the long run harmful to
 society

I think that you are drawing links where there are none  having sex before
marriage has nothing to do with adultery once committed into marriage The
issue as I see it is more of how committed you are to not foisting pain on
your spouse and how confident you are about yourself 
	In addition what someone does within their marriage is their own 
business not mine and not yours I have witnessed strong relationships
that incorporate extramarital sex 
	I would agree with your assertion about children  children should not  be witness to such confusing relationships  if adultery is stressful to 
adults which I assume it in general is how can we expect children to 
understand it
 
 Where is the evidence for my opinions  At the moment there are just
 generalities I can cite  For example I read that in the th century
 the percentage of youth and people in general who suffer from
 depression has been steadily climbing in Western societies probably
 what I was reading referred particularly to the USA  Similarly one
 can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage
 in this century in Western societies  particularly with the sexual
 revolution of the 's but even before that I think otherwise the
 sexual revolution of the 's would not have been possible
 particularly with the gradual weakening of Christianity and consequently
 Christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage  I propose
 that these two trends  greater level of general depression in society
 and other psychological problems and greater sexual promiscuity  are
 linked with the latter being a prime cause of the former  I cannot
 provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis
 seems very reasonable to me and I request that people ponder upon it

Why is it more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards
depression You can't just pick your two favorite trends notice a correlation 
in them and make a sweeping statement of generality I mean you CAN and 
people HAVE but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable thesis 
At best it's a gross oversimplification of the pushpull factors people 
experience  

My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument
against extramarital sex  one which I personally believe has some
truth  My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a
plausible argument can be made against extramarital sex  At this
stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or
anything like that just that it is plausible  To try to convince you
all of this particular point of view I would probably have to do a lot
of work researching what has been done in this field etc in order to
gather further evidence which I simply do not have time to do now  

Also note that I said that I think extramarital sex is a prime cause
in my opinion of the generally greater levels of psychological
problems especially depression in Western societies  I am not saying
it is the prime cause or the only cause just a prime cause 
ie one of the significant contributions to this trend  I think when
you say you think my view is simplistic you have forgotten this  I
admit that there are probably other factors but I do think that
extramarital sex and IMO subsequent destabilization of the family
is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like
depression in Western society this century

Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society
are far too complicated for us to control We just have to hold on to the
panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing But one
things for sure depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not
due solely to sex out of marriage

Note that I never said that depression and the destruction of the
nuclear family is due solely to extramarital sex  I specifically
said that it was a prime cause of this not the prime cause or the
only cause of this  I recognize that there are probably other factors
too but I think that extramarital sex and subsequent destabilization
of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in
psychological problems including depression in the West in the th
century

dariceyoyoccmonasheduau Fred Rice writes

My point of view is that the argument all sexism is bad just simply
does not hold  Let me give you an example  How about permitting a
woman to temporarily leave her job due to pregnancy  should that be
allowed  It happens to be sexist as it gives a particular right only
to women  Nevertheless despite the fact that it is sexist I completely 
support such a law because I think it is just

Fred you're exasperating  Sexism like racialism is a form of
discrimination using obvious physical or cultural differences to deny
one portion of the population the same rights as another

In this context your example above holds no water whatsoever
there's no discrimination in denying men maternity leave in fact
I'm quite convinced that were anyone to experiment with male
pregnancy it would be possible for such a future father to take
leave on medical grounds

Okay I argued this thoroughly about  weeks ago  Men and women are
different  physically physiologically and psychologically  Much
recent evidence for this statement is present in the book Brainsex by
Anne Moir and David Jessel  I recommend you find a copy and read it
Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic
and is well referenced 

Now if women and men are different in some ways the law can only
adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are
different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women
are different  Maternity leave is an example of this  it takes into
account that women get pregnant  It does not give women the same rules
it would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in this
instance would be unjust  This is just simply an obvious example of
where men and women are intrinsically different

Now people make the naive argument that sexism  oppression
However maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT 
Men do not have the same access to leave that women do not to the same
extent or degree and therefore IT IS SEXIST  No matter however much a
man wants to get pregnant and have maternity leave HE NEVER CAN  And
therefore the law IS SEXIST  No man can have access to maternity leave
NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT  I hope this is clear

Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because the
sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and women
different  There are many other differences between men and women which
are far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these I
recommend you have a look at the book Brainsex

Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious
If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically
become women  To have a womb and the other factors required for
pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is 
so your argument when it is examined is seen to be fallacious  You
are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that 
women can have if they also become women  which actually just supports
my statement that maternity leave is sexist

The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities
because of her legally determined sexual inferiorities  As I
understand most religious sexual discrimination and I doubt that
Islam is exceptional the female is not allowed into the priestly
caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to
rights which as an equal human she ought to be entitled to

There is no official priesthood in Islam  much of this function is
taken by Islamic scholars  There are female Islamic scholars and
female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam  An example from
early Islamic history is the Prophet's widow Aisha who was recognized
in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar

No matter how sweetly you coat it part of the role of religions
seems historically to have served the function of oppressing the
female whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where
there is no opportunity for selfimprovement or by denying her
access to the same facilities the males are offered

You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions and
I dispute it  I could go on and on about women in Islam etc but I
recently reposted something here under the heading Islam and Women 
if it is still at your newssite I suggest you read it  It is reposted
from socreligionislam so if it has disappeared from altatheism it
still might be in socreligionislam I forgot what its original title
was though  I will email it to you if you like 

The Roman Catholic Church is the most blatant of the culprit
because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy but the
other religious are no different let a woman attempt to escape her
role as child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her

Your statement that other religions are no different is I think a
statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than
Christianity and perhaps Judaism

I'll accept your affirmation that Islam grants women the same rights
as men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the
same position as say Khomeini and there are no artificial religious
or social obstacles on her path to achieve this

Aisha who I mentioned earlier was not only an Islamic scholar but also
was at one stage a military leader

Show me the equivalent of Hillary RhodamClinton within Islam and I
may consider discussing the issue with you

The Prophet's first wife who died just before the Hijra the

As an addition to Chris Faehl's post what about homosexuals

Well from an Islamic viewpoint homosexuality is not the norm for
society  I cannot really say much about the Islamic viewpoint on homosexuality 
as it is not something I have done much research on

Benedikt Rosenau writes with great authority

     IF IT IS CONTRADICTORY IT CANNOT EXIST

Contradictory is a property of language  If I correct this to

      THINGS DEFINED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST

I will object to definitions as reality  If you then amend it to

      THINGS DESCRIBED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST

then we've come to something which is plainly false  Failures in
description are merely failures in description

 How about this description An object that is at one time both a
Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle I hold that no object satisfying
this description could exist The description is inconsistent and hence
describes an object that could not exist
 Now suppose someone pointed to a bicycle and said That object is
at one time both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle This does
not mean that the bicycle does not exist it measn that the description
was incorrectly applied
 
 The atheist says The descriptions of God that I have been presented with
are contradictory and hence describe something that cannot exist
 Now your position so far as I can gather is that God exists but the
descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions
of It
 This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle and
when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one
are told that it is a Euclidean circlesquare Can they be blamed for
doubting rather strongly that this 'bicycle' exists at all

I'm not an objectivist remember

 No kidding

 So every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children
 Hmmno wonder the world is overpopulated  Obviously you keep to the
 Monty Python song  Every sperm is sacred  And if as you say it has
 a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own 
 arguement natural

Consider the context I'm talking about an evolutionary function One
of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a
species procreate those who don't have no purpose in that context

 Oh I guess all those social insects eg ants bees etc which
have one breeding queen and a whole passel of sterile workers are on
the way out huh
 
 These days is just ain't true  People can decide whether or not to have 
 children and when  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex c but that's 
 another arguement so it's more of a lifestyle decision  Again by
 your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they
 must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children  Both are 
 as unnatural as each other

Yet another nonsequitur Sex is an evolutionary function that exists
for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental That
homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is only recreation and
nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose

 I refer you to the bonobos a species of primate as closeley related to
humans as chimpanzees that is very closely They have sex all the
time homosexual as well as heterosexual When the group finds food they
have sex Before the go to sleep at night they have sex After they
escape from or fight off prdators they have sex Sex serves a very important
social function above and beyond reproduction in this species A species
closely related to humans There is some indication that sex performs
a social function in humans as well but even if not this shows that
such a function is not impossible

   Yesterday I got the chance to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak at the
University of New Hampshire Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the 
honorary head of the American Humanist Association Vonnegut is
an atheist and so was Asimov Before Asimov's funeral Vonnegut stood up
and said about Asimov He's in heaven now which ignited uproarious 
laughter in the room from the people he was speaking to around the time
of the funeral

	 It's the funniest thing I could have possibly said
to a room full of humanists Vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture 

         If Vonnegut comes to speak at your university I highly recommend
going to see him even if you've never read any of his novels In my opinion
he's the greatest living humorist greatest living humanist humorist as well

something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam

If anything the BSA has taught me I don't know tolerance or something
Before I met this guy I thought all gays were 'faries'  So the BSA HAS
taught me to be an antibigot

I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout
back in the s The issue wasn't gays but the principles were the
same Thanks for a well put testimonial Stan Krieger and his kind who
think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the
only acceptable position in scouting should take notice The BSA has
been hijacked by the religious right but some of the core values have
survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
haven't given up Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that
scouting is still worth fighting for

On a cautionary note you must realize that if your experience with this
camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing
it Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo

  I always thought that homophobe was only a word used at Act UP
  rallies I didn't beleive real people used it Let's see if we agree
  on the term's definition A homophobe is one who actively and
  militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually a latent
  homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation
  Since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is a
  homophobe your implication is clear it must necessarily follow that
  all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least
  
 
 Crap crap crap crap crap  A definition of any type of 'phobe comes from
 phobia  an irrational fear of  Hence a homophobe not only in ACT UP meetings
 the word is apparently in general use now  Or perhaps it isn't in the bible  
 Wouldst thou prefer if I were to communicate with thou in bilespeak
 
 Does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider  Does an
 agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space  Do you
 understand English
 
 Obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it  They will do their best
 to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or
 run away  Or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes  People
 who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or
 cause them or themselves violence
 

Isn't that what I said 
What are you taking issue with here your remarks are merely
parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful

 
 
  It would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function
  other than limiting population growth since evolution only occurs
  when the members of one generation pass along their traits to
  subsequent generations Homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend If I
  take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to
  intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our
  species at least is going nowhere
  
 
 So every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children
 Hmmno wonder the world is overpopulated  Obviously you keep to the
 Monty Python song  Every sperm is sacred  And if as you say it has
 a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own 
 arguement natural

Consider the context I'm talking about an evolutionary function One
of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a
species procreate those who don't have no purpose in that context

 
  Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to
  survive the participation of both parents is necessary  a family must
  exist since homosexuals do not reproduce they cannot constitute a
  family Since the majority of humankind is part of a family
  homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you
  will
  
 
 Well if that is true by your own arguements homosexuals would have 
 vanished years ago due to nonprocreation  Also the parent from single
 parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must
 by your arguement die

By your argument homosexuality is genetically determined As to your
second point you prove again that you have no idea what context
means I am talking about evolution the preservation of the species
the fundamental premise of the whole process
 
  But it gets worse Since the overwhelming majority of people actually
  prefer a heterosexual relationship homosexuality is a social
  abberation as well The homosexual eschews the biological imperative
  to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in
  the most fundamental social element the family But wait there's
  more
  
 
 Read the above  I expect you to have at least ten children by now with
 the family growing  These days sex is less to do with procreation admittedly
 without it there would be noone but more to do with pleasure  In prepill
 and precondom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children
 These days is just ain't true  People can decide whether or not to have 
 children and when  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex c but that's 
 another arguement so it's more of a lifestyle decision  Again by
 your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must
 be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children  Both are 
 as unnatural as each other

Yet another nonsequitur Sex is an evolutionary function that exists
for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental That
homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is only recreation and
nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose

 
  Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some
  policy makers that they have civil rights they are now claiming that
  their sexuality is a preference a lifestyle an orientation a
  choice that should be protected by law Now if homosexuality is a mere
  choice and if it is both contrary to nature and antisocial then it
  is a perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they
  became prominent 
  
 
 People are people are people  Who are you to tell anyone else how to live
 their life  Are you godtm  If so fancy a date

Here's pretty obvious dodge do you really think you've said anything
or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement I am not
telling anyone anything I am demonstrating that there are arguments
against the practice of homosexuality providing it's a merely an
alternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonably
call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand I realize
of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value
and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if you
are to be consistent you have no case in this regard
 
  To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to
  ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of
  the homosexual lifestyle But since the charge is only intended to
  intimidate it's really just demogoguery and not to be taken
  seriously Fact is Jim there are far more persuasive arguments for
  suppressing homosexuality than those given but consider this a start
  
 
 Again crap  All your arguments are based on outdated ideals  Likewise the
 bible  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by
 a bastard to eternal damnation  Or someone who crushes his penis either
 accidently or not  Both are in Deuteronomy

I'm sure your comment pertains to something but you've disguised it
so well I can't see what Where did I mention ideals outdated or
otherwise Your arguments are very reactionary do you have anything
at all to contribute

 
  As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in
  scouting the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from
  teaching by their own logic homosexuals are deviates social and
  biological Since any adult is a role model for a child it is
  incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from
  those who would do the child harm In this case harm means primarily
  social though that could be extended easily enough
  
  
 
 You show me anyone who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as
 normal and will take of my hat Puma baseball cap to you  One man's meat
 is another man's poison
 

What has this got to do with anything Would you pick a single point
that you find offensive and explain your objections I would really
like to believe that you can discuss this issue intelligibly

 	Wild and fanciful claims require greater evidence If you state that 
 one of the books in your room is blue I certainly do not need as much 
 evidence to believe than if you were to claim that there is a two headed 
 leapard in your bed  and I don't mean a male lover in a leotard 

Keith 

If the issue is What is Truth then the consequences of whatever
proposition argued is irrelevent If the issue is What are the consequences
if such and such is True then Truth is irrelevent Which is it to
be

	I disagree every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence 
and support before one can believe it There are a miriad of factors for 
each individual As we are all different we quite obviously require 
different levels of evidence

	As one pointed out one's history is important While in FUSSR one 
may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans 
One would need more evidence than if one lived in the United States The 
only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US is if the 
individual always wear business suits etc

	The degree of the effect upon the world and the strength of the 
claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary When determining the 
level of evidence one needs it is most certainly relevent what the 
consequences of the proposition are



	If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent please explain 
why one would not accept The electromagnetic force of attraction between 
two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their 
distance apart 

	Remember if the consequences of the law are not relevent then
we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof If one of the 
consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of 
affairs or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law 
they are irrelevent when theorizing about the Truth of the law

	Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent including 
the consequence of selfcontradiction or contradiction with the state of 
affiars how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not let alone find
The Truth



	By the way what is Truth Please define before inserting it in 
the conversation Please explain what Truth or TRUTH is I do think that 
anything is ever known for certain Even if there IS a Truth we could 
never possibly know if it were I find the concept to be meaningless

I cannot see any evidence for the V B which the cynics in this group would
ever accept  As for the second it is the foundation of the religion
Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus back in the  day period
is a believer and therefore is discounted by those in this group since
these are all ancients anyway one again to choose to dismiss the whole
thing  The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else
even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it means so
again I don't see how evidence is possible

 
No cookies Charlie The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited
as extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence In this case it
is for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been
seen Further there are zillions of other spook stories and one would
hardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence of
a resurrection
 
There have been more elaborate arguments made but it looks as if they have
not passed your post filtering
 
 
I thus interpret the extraordinary claims claim as a statement that the
speaker will not accept any evidence on the matter
 
It is no evidence in the strict meaning If there was actual evidence it would
probably be part of it but the says nothing about the claims

     IF IT IS CONTRADICTORY IT CANNOT EXIST

Contradictory is a property of language  If I correct this to


      THINGS DEFINED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST

 
No need to correct it it stands as it is said
 
 
 
I will object to definitions as reality  If you then amend it to

      THINGS DESCRIBED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST

then we've come to something which is plainly false  Failures in
description are merely failures in description

 
You miss the point entirely Things defined by contradictory language
do not exist Though something existing might be meant conclusions
drawn from the description are wrong unless there is the possibility
to find the described and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of
the described then Another possibility is to drop the contradictory
part but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented
and that one has not got to doubt the source of it as well
 
I'm not an objectivist remember

 
Neither am I But either things are directly sensed which includes
some form of modelling by the way or they are used in modelling
Using something contradictive in modelling is not approved of
Wonder why
 
We remain with the question if something contradictory can be sensed
as contradictory An important point is that either one manages to
resolve the contradictions or one is forced not to use or to refer
to the contradictory part in drawing conclusions or one will fall
in the garbage in garbage out trap

In article phkfINNpdsidsinccom perrydsinccom Jim Perry writes

Rushdie is however as I understand a muslim
The fact that he's a British citizen does not preclude his being muslim

Rushdie was an atheist to use local terminology not to put words in
his mouth at the time of writing TSV and at the time of the fatwa in
February 

Well if he was born muslim I am fairly certain he was then he is 
muslim until he explicitly renounces Islam So far as I know he has never
explicitly renounced Islam though he may have been in extreme doubt
about the existence of God Being muslim is a legal as well as
intellectual issue according to Islam

To put it as simply as possible I am not a Muslim I do not
 accept the charge of apostacy because I have never in my adult life
 affirmed any belief and what one has not affirmed one can not be
 said to have apostasized from  The Islam I know states clearly that
 'there can be no coercion in matters of religion'  The many Muslims
 I respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their
 faith purely by virtue of birth and that a person who freely chose
 not to be a Muslim could therefore be put to death
    	    	    	    	Salman Rushdie In Good Faith 

God Satan Paradise and Hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth
 year when I quite abruptly lost my faith  and afterwards to
 prove my newfound atheism I bought myself a rather tasteless ham
 sandwich and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of
 the swine  No thunderbolt arrived to strike me down  From that
 day to this I have thought of myself as a wholly seculat person
    	    	    	    	Salman Rushdie In God We Trust 
 
I think the Rushdie affair has discredited Islam more in my eyes than
Khomeini  I know there are fanatics and fringe elements in all
religions but even apparently moderate Muslims have participated or
refused to distance themselves from the witchhunt against Rushdie

Yes I think this is true but there Khomenei's motivations are quite
irrelevant to the issue The fact of the matter is that Rushdie made
false statements fiction I know but where is the line between fact
and fiction about the life of Mohammad 

Only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the
nature of the novel could think such a thing  I'll accept it
reluctantly from mobs in Pakistan but not from you  What is
presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the
wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the
actual Mohammad  What's worse the novel doesn't present the
MahoundMohammed character in any worse light than secular histories
of Islam in particular there is no lewd misrepresentation of his
life or that of his wives

That is why
few people rush to his defense  he's considered an absolute fool for 
his writings in The Satanic Verses 

Don't hold back he's considered an apostate and a blasphemer
However it's not for his writing in The Satanic Verses but for
what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is
contained in that book  I have yet to find one single muslim who
has convinced me that they have read the book  Some have initially
claimed to have done so but none has shown more knowledge of the book
than a superficial Newsweek story might impart and all have made
factual misstatements about events in the book

If you wish to understand the
reasons behind this as well has the origin of the concept of the
satanic verses  see the
Penguin paperback by Rafiq Zakariyah called Mohammad and the Quran

I'll keep an eye out for it  I have a counterproposal I suggest
that you see the Viking hardcover by Salman Rushdie called The
Satanic Verses  Perhaps then you'll understand

   The Earth is evil because Satan rules over it
   
   This is a new one to me  I guess it's been a while since a Witness
   bothered with me  Are they implying that Satan is omniscient  You
   might try tricking them into saying that Satan is 'allknowing' and
   then use that statement to show them how their beliefs are
   selfcontradictary  
  
  No Satan is not omniscient but he does hold dominion over the earth
  according to Christian theology note not to be confused with JW's
  theology 
  
  
  What are the standard theologies on whowhat created Satan
  and why
  
 
 Orthodox Christian theology states that God created Lucifer Satan
 along with the other angels presumably because He wanted beings to
 celebrate glorify existence and life and thereby God along with
 Him  Actually the whys and wherefores of God's motivations for 
 creating the angels are not a big issue within Christian theology
 
 But God created Lucifer with a perfect nature and gave him along with
 the other angels free moral will  Lucifer was a high angel perhaps
 the highest with great authority  It seems that his greatness caused
 him to begin to take pride in himself and desire to be equal to or
 greater than God  He forgot his place as a created being  He exalted
 himself above God and thereby evil and sin entered creation

Actually the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as 
God commanded him to  Lucifer was devoted to God

Oh yeah there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anything
more than a snake well a talking onehad legs at the time too

I don't think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best way
to show the error in theology  if they think a supernatural entity
kicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a
fruit that gave them special powerswell they might not respond
well to reason and logic

 There has been some discussion on the pros and cons about sex outside of
 marriage
  
 
 Where is the evidence for my opinions  At the moment there are just
 generalities I can cite  For example I read that in the th century
 the percentage of youth and people in general who suffer from
 depression has been steadily climbing in Western societies probably
 what I was reading referred particularly to the USA  Similarly one
 can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage
 in this century in Western societies  particularly with the sexual
 revolution of the 's but even before that I think otherwise the
 sexual revolution of the 's would not have been possible
 particularly with the gradual weakening of Christianity and consequently
 Christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage  I propose
 that these two trends  greater level of general depression in society
 and other psychological problems and greater sexual promiscuity  are
 linked with the latter being a prime cause of the former  I cannot
 provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis
 seems very reasonable to me and I request that people ponder upon it
 
  Fred Rice  a Muslim giving his point of view
  dariceyoyoccmonasheduau   

I think this is a big leap sexdepression  One example is myself
where no sexdepression   But seriously  promiscuity is on a decline
depression is not and  it might be more reasonable to say 
depressionpromiscuity  I think depression is more likely to come
from emotional problems relationships family job friends and
promiscuity is used as an escape
Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an
emotional bond I don't see a problem with sex before not outside of
marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as
what is expected from a married couple  Of course this is just 
my opinion

And what about that revelation thing Charley

If you're talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well
it's obviously a risk one takes

 
I see it is not rational but it is intellectual Does madness qualify
as intellectual engagement too
 
 
Many people say that the concept of metaphysical and religious knowledge
is contradictive

I'm not an objectivist so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of
conceptualization  The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of
trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary
experience  One can get some rough understanding but the language is from
the perspective of ordinary phenomena inconsistent and from the
perspective of what's being described rather inexact to be charitable

 
Exactly why science uses mathematics QM representation in natural language
is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical
terminology Nor is it supposed to be the truth as opposed to the
representation of gods or religions in ordinary language Admittedly
not  every religion says so but a fancy side effect of their inept
representations are the eternal hassles between religions
 
And QM allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will
be agreed upon as being similar Show me something similar in religion
 
 
An analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is
that the better descriptive language is not available

 
With the effect that the models presented are useless And one can argue
that the other way around namely that the only reason metaphysics still
flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified 
showing that it is bogus
 
 
And in case it holds reliable information can you show how you establish
that

This word reliable is essentially meaningless in the context unless you
can show how reliability can be determined
 
Haven't you read the many posts about what reliability is and how it can
be acheived respectively determined

Should we British go around blowing up skyscrapers next

I don't know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying 
 that the person accused of blowing up the WTC in NY actually did it
and
 that Islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the WTC

WTC  World Trade Centre which was the building that was blown up I
think

Okay to make some comments

 The person has only been accused  innocent until proven guilty
remember  Secondly there seem to be some holes in his accusation that
I read about  For instance if they guy used that particular van to
blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back
afterwards he must be incredibly stupid  

Perhaps Salamen was one of those uneducated Muslims we hear so much about

Nevertheless he was
apparently smart enough to put together a very sophisticated bomb  It
doesn't seem to fit together somehow  

Actually Salameh was not the ONLY person involved  The other fellow was
a chemical engineer working for Allied Signal who had specifically studied
explosive devices in school believe it or not  we actually allow radical
Muslim types to study things like this in our universities  so much for
the price of freedom

From what I read the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together
over the phone  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated
type so to put a I assume complicated sophisticated bomb together
from instructions over the phone  one must need some brains I would
expect

Despite this there have
already been many attacks and threats against mosques and Muslims in the
United States as a consequence of his accusation I have read


OK now please tell us where this is happening  I live in the US and
I have heard very little about these mosque attacks  There are many mosques
in Houston Texas and I would like to know what is going on so I can verify
this  Or is the Great Jewish Media Conspiracy keeping us from knowing about
this in the US  We heard about the mosque attacks during the Desert Storm
venture so why is it so quiet now  Maybe it is localized to New Jersey

I read this in an article in The Australian Muslim Times the
newspaper weekly of the Australian Muslim community  

If this is true perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America if
they see this posting can elaborate

 Islamic teachings teach against harming the innocent  In the Qur'an
it explicitly teaches against harming innocents even in times of war
The blowing up of the WTC and harming innocents is therefore in blatant
contradiction to Islamic teachings

This means absolutely nothing  Plenty of people commit violence while 
following what they think are valid religious principles  I have seen
people post many things here from the Koran which could be misinterpreted
if that is the explanation you wish to use by an uneducated Muslim to
allow them to harm idolators and unbelievers  The first thing every Muslim
says is that no Muslim could have done that because Islam teaches against
harming innocents  And we are supposed to take you WORD that it NEVER
happens   What do you think is the consequence  Does Allah strike them
down before the alleged violence occurs  Of course not  Muslims commit
the violent act and then everyone hides behind verses in the Koran  We're
pretty hip to that trick  And I even doubt that it will come up in the
trials  

My defense is that I am Muslim and Islam teaches me not to harm the innocent
Therefore the people who were killed must not have been innocent  Sure we
set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir I am a Muslim
Allah is allpowerful  Allah would not have allowed this  Are you insulting
my religion

Great defense eh

Just admit that there are some incredibly stupid violent Muslims in the 
world and stop hiding from that fact  It does no one any good to deny it
It only makes the more reasonable Muslims look like they are protecting the
bad ones  Can you see that

I don't deny this fact

The thrust of my argument here is that 

a Salameh is according to US law innocent as he has not been found
guilty in a court of law  As his guilt has not been established it is
wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption

b Islam teaches us not to harm innocents  If Muslims  who perhaps
have not realized that Islam teaches this  perform such actions it is
not because of the teachings of Islam but rather in spite of and
in contradiction to the  teachings of Islam  This is an important 
distinction

I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say Muslim  In
general anyone who calls themselves a Muslim and does not do or 
outwardly profess
something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam
is considered to be a Muslim  Thus one who might do things contrary to
Islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly not become a
Muslim  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential
principles though then one does leave Islam

The term Muslim is to be contrasted with Mu'min which means true
believer  However whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is
something known only by God and perhaps that person himself  So you
will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in altatheism
because it is not known to anybody except myself and God whether I
for example am a true believer or not  For example I could just be
putting on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to
what I write here without anyone knowing  Thus when we say Muslims
we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam whether in
practice they might in ignorance transgress Islamic teachings  By
Muslim we do not necessarily mean Mu'min or true believer in
Islam

I was responding to the historical accuracy of Biblical claims

This is the usual theist approach  No matter how many times a certain

they keep cropping up time after time

Speaking of nonsequiturs this has little to do with what I just said  And
have some sauce for the goose some of the disproof is fallacies repeated

New in this version  challenge  plus an addendum summarizing
Charley's responses todate


 This is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage
 Charley Wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently 
 specious claims  I'll continue to repost periodically until
 he answers them publicly indicates that he won't answer them
 stops posting to altatheism the altatheism community tells
 me to stop or I get totally bored  I apologize for the 
 somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but I'm at a loss
 to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and 
 seeming intellectual dishonesty

 This is repost 


Charley

I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers
to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your
previous posts  I submit that you don't answer them because you
cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic and I once
again challenge you to prove me wrong  To make the task as easy for
you as possible I'll present concise restatements of some of the
questions that you have failed to answer in the hope that you may
address them one at a time for all to see

Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period I
will repost this article with suitable additions and deletions at
such time that I notice a post by you on another topic  I will repeat
this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or
you cease to post to this newsgroup

I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these
questions previously and your answer missed my notice  If you can be
kind enough to repost or email such articles I will be only too
pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it
from this list

Now to the questions

 After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological
patterns that you proposed then semiretracting that claim by stating
that you weren't referring to all atheists I asked you to name some
atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns to show that you indeed
were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of  You failed
to do so  Please do so now

Question Can you name any aa posters who do not fit into your
stereotype

Here is the context for the question

 This is not true for everyone on this board and you are out of line
 in assuming that it is

YOU however deleted the text further along where I said that I didn't mean
to imply that everybody's experience was along the same lines  

Whether or not you mean to make such implications you do so
repeatedly  

Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name
those atheists that you've come across who do not fit into the
patterns that you theorize


 You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and
reason are all we have to go by and when pressed you have implied
that we have an alternative called revelation  I have repeatedly
asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both
experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses
and reason  You failed to do so  Please do so now

Question Can you explain what is revelation and how one can
experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent
reasoning

Here is the context for the question

Revelation is not reason and if we DO have revelation then
reasoning is NOT all we have

First show me that revelation exists  Second if revelation is not
perceived through the senses how exactly is it perceived  According
to my Webster's revelation is an act of revealing or communicating
divine truth  Now tell me how such a thing can be revealed
communicated other than via the senses  Tell me how you can interpret
this revelation other than with reason that is using your brain to
interpret what you are sensing  When I say there is no way for a
human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as
interpreted by reason your brain it is because this is the simple
truth  If you have another mechanism of interface by all means
share it with us

then later

You CANNOT escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is
our senses and our reason period

Again this is indefensible  

No it is simple truth  I challenge you to show me otherwise

then later

Few mystics will agree to this assertion and the common defense of
redefining senses to absorb for instance mystical experiences is
begs the question of whether some senses are better than others

I allow you the broadest definition of senses to make things easier
for you  Now show me that mystical experiences exist  Remember
you aren't allowed to go by testimony of others eg mystics since
you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable  you know tainted by
my own bias  Further once these mystical thingies are absorbed show
me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of
interpretation via that person's reasoning capabilities

I challenge you to show me these things  If you cannot do so you
might as well give up the fight

then later

Let me reiterate you have NOT explained your interpretation of your
experiences so it is not possible for me to have attacked them  In
point of fact I specifically challenged you to explain this
revelation stuff that you were talking about and I note for the
record that you appear to have declined my challenge

What is it  How is it sensed  How is it interpreted  And
how does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit
of our senses and reasoning abilities  You have answered none of
these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims  If you
can't answer them your claims are entirely specious


  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by
aa posters are unverifiable and fantastical  I asked you to identify
one such claim that I have made  You have failed to do so  Please do
so now

Question Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and
fantastical  If so please repeat them

Here is the context for the question


I must thank David Wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong 
posting  

then later

Likewise the reference to unverifiable fantastical
claims represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to
dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group

Give me your address and I'll be pleased to send you a dictionary
Failing that can you name ONE claim that I have made that is in any
sense unverifiable or fantastical  I demand that you retract this
statement if you cannot offer up evidence  If you follow your usual
pattern of ignoring the challenge then you are simply an asshole


  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as
a result of reason then later you stated that if one accepted the
axioms of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist  I asked
you to explain the contradiction  Your only response was a statement
that the question was incoherent an opinion not shared by others that
I have asked be they atheist or theist  You have failed to answer
the question  Please do so now

Question Do you retract your claim that aa posters have not become
atheists as a result of reason despite their testimony to that
effect  If you don't retract that claim do you retract the
subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably
result in atheism

Here is the context for the question

First quote
we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is
based on reason it is up to atheists to prove it to me

then

Second quote
but I do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with
an atheistic point of view


  First you claimed that you would probably not answer these
Challenges because they contained too much in the way of included
text from previous posts  Later you implied that you wouldn't
respond because I was putting words in your mouth  Please clarify
this seeming contradiction

Question  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context
from your own posts or that I paraphrase your positions in order to
avoid included text

Here is the context for the question

First you said

My ordinary rules are that I don't read articles over over  lines
or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first
screen  THese are not rules of morality but practicality

then later

If someone is not going to argue with MY version of MY position then
they cannot be argued with


As usual your responses are awaited with anticipation

Dave Wood


ps For the record below is a compilation of Charley's responses to
these challenges to date


This makes no sense to me at all it gives the appearance either of utter
incoherence or of answering some question of Mr Wood's imagination

 
Mr Wood I do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on
the net requires any response whatsoever  At some point I might read and
respond to your article and then again I might not  My ordinary rules are
that I don't read articles over over  lines or articles in which there is
nothing but included text on the first screen  THese are not rules of
morality but practicality

 
I left out something else I don't respond to

Utmost on my list of things to avoid are arguments about the arguments
metaarguments as some call them


When I have to start saying that's not what I said and the response is
did so there's no reason to continue  If someone is not going to argue
with MY version of MY position then they cannot be argued with

I think an objective morality does exist but that most flavors of morality
are only approximations to it  Once again a natural or objective morality
is fairly easily defined as long as you have a goal in mindthat is what
is the purpose of this morality
Maybe I'm not quite getting what you mean by this but I think objective 
morality is an oxymoron  By definition it seems any goal oriented 
issue like this is subjective by nature  I don't get how you're using
the word objective

But the goal need not be a subjective one  For instance the goal of
natural morality is the propogation of a species perhaps  It wasn't
really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions
to this were necessary  Intelligent animals have different needs than
the others and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more
complicated than the law of the jungle  I don't think that
selfactualization is so subjective as you might think  And by
objectivity I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be
carried out completely

I have a request for those who would like to see Charley Wingate
respond to the Charley Challenges and judging from my email there
appear to be quite a few of you  

It is clear that Mr Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or
unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves  Between
the last two repostings of the Challenges I noted perhaps a dozen or
more posts by Mr Wingate none of which answered a single Challenge  

It seems unmistakable to me that Mr Wingate hopes that the questions
will just go away and he is doing his level best to change the
subject  Given that this seems a rather common nettheist tactic I
would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers
in the following manner

 Ignore any future articles by Mr Wingate that do not address the
Challenges until he answers them or explictly announces that he
refuses to do so

or

 If you must respond to one of his articles include within it
something similar to the following

    Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges

Really I'm not looking to humiliate anyone here I just want some
honest answers  You wouldn't think that honesty would be too much to
ask from a devout Christian would you  

Nevermind that was a rhetorical question

Assuming you are presenting it accurately I don't see how this argument
really leads to any firm conclusion  The material in John I'm not sure
exactly what is referred to here but I'll take for granted the similarity
to the MattLuke Q material IS different hence one could have almost
any relationship between the two right up to John getting it straight from
Jesus' mouth

 
No the argument says John has known Q ie a codified version of the logia
and not the original assuming that there has been one It has weaknesses
of course like that John might have known the original yet rather referred
to Q in his text or that the logia were given in a codified version in
the first place
 
The argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion but it fits well into
the dating usually given for the gospels
 
 
We are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors The usual
explanation for the time order of Mark Matthew and Luke does not consider
their respective ages It says Matthew has read the text of Mark and Luke
that of Matthew and probably that of Mark

The version of the usual theory I have heard has Matthew and Luke
independently relying on Mark and Q  One would think that if Luke relied
on Matthew we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies
for one thing

 
Not necessarily Luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the
version given by Matthew Improving on Matthew would give a motive for
instance
 
As far as I know the theory that Luke has known Matthew is based on a
statistical analysis of the texts
 
 
As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text The evidence
for that is not overwhelming admittedly

This is the part that is particularly new to me  If it were possible that
you could point me to a reference I'd be grateful

 
Yep but it will take another day or so to get the source I hope your German
is good enough 
 
 
Unfortunately I haven't got the info at hand  It was I think in the late
's or early 's and it was possibly as old as CE 

When they are from about  why do they shed doubt on the order on
putting John after the rest of the three

Because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing
copy quit a bit  The further away from the original the more copies can be
written and therefore survival becomes more probable

 
I still do not see how copies from  allow to change the dating of John
 
 
That John was a disciple is not generally accepted The style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument

I'm not really impressed with the theology argument  But I'm really
pointing this out as an if  And as I pointed out earlier one cannot make
these arguments about I Peter I see no reason not to accept it as an
authentic letter

 
Yes but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence The authencity of
many letters is still discussed It looks as if conclusions about them are not
drawn because some pet dogmas of the churches would probably fall with them as
well
 
 
One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times Compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies

The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is
not so bad

 
Well rather like some newsletter of a political party reporting from the
big meeting Not necessarily wrong but certainly bad
 
 
In other words one does not know what the original of Mark did look like
and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak

But the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case it's
agreed that the most important epistles predate Mark
 
Yes but the accuracy of their tradition is another problem
 
Question Are there letters not from Paul and predating Mark claiming the
divinity of Jesus

 I will argue that your latter statement I believe that no gods exist
 does rest upon faith  that is if you are making a POSITIVE statement
 that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying I don't
 know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then
 weak atheism Once again to not believe in God is different than
 saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist I still maintain the 
 position even after reading the FAQs that strong atheism requires 
 faith
 
  
 No it in the way it is usually used In my view you are saying here 
 that driving a car requires faith that the car drives
  

I'm not saying this at all  it requires no faith on my part to
say the car drives because I've seen it drive  I've done more
than at in fact  I've actually driven it now what does require
some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation
of what's out there But there is NO evidence  pro or con 
for the existence or nonexistence of God see what I have to
say below on this

 For me it is a conclusion and I have no more faith in it than I 
 have in the premises and the argument used
  

Sorry if I remain skeptical  I don't believe it's entirely a
conclusion That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God
is correct  neither have I But lack of evidence for the existence 
of something is in NO WAY evidence for the nonexistence of something 
the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they 
disprove evolution the establish creation You personally have never 
seen a neutrino before but they exist The pink unicorn analogy breaks
down and is rather naive I have a scientific theory that explains the 
appearance of animal life  evolution When I draw the conclusion that 
pink unicorns don't exist because I haven't seen them this conclusion
has it's foundation in observation and theory A pink unicorn if
it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entities
That is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth has
evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share 
a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such God however
has no such correspondence with anything IMO There is no physical
frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM 



 But first let me say the following
 We might have a language problem here  in regards to faith and
 existence I as a Christian maintain that God does not exist
 To exist means to have being in space and time God does not HAVE
 being  God IS Being Kierkegaard once said that God does not
 exist He is eternal With this said I feel it's rather pointless
 to debate the so called existence of God  and that is not what
 I'm doing here I believe that God is the source and ground of
 being When you say that god does not exist I also accept this
 statement  but we obviously mean two different things by it However
 in what follows I will use the phrase the existence of God in it's
 'usual sense'  and this is the sense that I think you are using it
 I would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of
 God
 
  
 No that's a word game 

I disagree with you profoundly on this I haven't defined God as
existence  in fact I haven't defined God But this might be
getting off the subject  although if you think it's relevant
we can come back to it 

  
 Further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is
 already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are 
 implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument 
 so far are incomplete making it a fallacy
  

You are using wrong categories here  or perhaps you misunderstand
what I'm saying I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no
definition so there is no fallacy I'm not trying to convince you of
anything I Believe  and that rests upon Faith And it is inappropriate
to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone tells you
that they can logically prove God or that they have evidence or 
then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary

BTW an incomplete argument is not a fallacy  some things are not
EVEN wrong 

  
 Deletion
 One can never prove that God does or does not exist When you say
 that you believe God does not exist and that this is an opinion
 based upon observation I will have to ask what observtions are
 you refering to There are NO observations  pro or con  that
 are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief
 Deletion
  
 Where does that follow Aren't observations based on the assumption
 that something exists
  

I don't follow you here Certainly one can make observations of
things that they didn't know existed I still maintain that one
cannot use observation to infer that God does not exist Such
a positive assertion requires a leap  



 And wouldn't you say there is a level of definition that the assumption
 god is is meaningful If not I would reject that concept anyway
  
 So where is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some 
 level

Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me I have no
EVIDENCE that 'god is' is meaningful at ANY level Maybe such
a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so
many people try to run their own private conception of God down
your throat I however am not doing this I am arguing one and
only one thing  that to make a positive assertion about something
for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against
requires a leap  it requires faith I am as you would say a
theist however there is a form of atheism that I can respect 
but it must be founded upon honesty

The statements I made were illustrative of the inescapably
anthrpomorphic quality of any desciption of an evolutionary process
There is no way evolution can be described or explained in terms other
than teleological that is my whole point Even those who have reason
to believe they understand evolution biologists for instance tend to
personify nature and I can't help but wonder if it's because of the
limits of the language or the nature of nature

I think you must have come in late The discussion on my part at
least began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of
the NT I was making the point that if the same standards are used to
validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history
then virtually nothing is known of the first century

You seem to be saying that the Bible cannot be true because it
speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact Your objection
has nothing to do with history it is merely another statement of
atheism

  Please enlighten me  How is omnipotence contradictory
 
 By definition all that can occur in the universe is governed by the rules
 of nature Thus god cannot break them Anything that god does must be allowed
 in the rules somewhere Therefore omnipotence CANNOT exist It contradicts
 the rules of nature
 
 Obviously an omnipotent god can change the rules

When you say By definition what exactly is being defined
certainly not omnipotence You seem to be saying that the rules of
nature are preexistant somehow that they not only define nature but
actually cause it If that's what you mean I'd like to hear your

 Xenophobia both de facto and de jure as implemented
 in legal systems is widespread while the Bible
 although not  egalitarian specifically preaches
 kindness to the stranger and emphasizes in the Book

 Clearly better than the alternative but as an American what strikes

Jim

There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread
that are a little confusing An atheist is one for whom all things can
be understood as processes of nature  exclusively There is no need
for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything There is
no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by
physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is
determnined
This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all
its products There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it
acquire intelligence it's just a happy accident For an atheist no
event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less
value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about
an event can have value 
The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment
from teaching training observation and experience and are only
significant to the individual mind wherein they reside These mental
processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical
activity and nothing more content is of no consequence The human
mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a
hill
How then can an atheist judge value What is the basis for criticizing
the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God On
what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned It
seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you
have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what
in nature can serve that purpose What law of nature can you invoke to
establish your values
Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what
difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or
otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value The only
way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the
objection is entirely subjective and that heshe just doesn't like it
 that's it Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer
that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries
no weight in any absolute sense
That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God
or God's commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your
nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled
with a preexisting thoughtset to form that reaction That your
objections seem well founded is due to the way you've been
conditioned there is no truth content The whole of your
intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality
I didn't make these rules it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and
to be consistent you have to accept the nonsignificance of any human
thought even your own All of this being so you have excluded
yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil
etc and cannot participate Your opinion about the Bible can have no
weight whatsoever

Of course people say what they think to be the religion and that this
is not exactly the same coming from different people within the
religion  There is nothing with there existing different perspectives
within the religion  perhaps one can say that they tend to converge on
the truth

My point is that they are doing a lot of harm on the way in the meantime

And that they converge is counterfactual religions appear to split and
diverge Even when there might be a 'True Religion' at the core the layers
above determine what happens in practise and they are quite inhumane
usually

 
What you post then is supposed to be an answer but I don't see what is has
got to do with what I say
 
I will repeat it Religions as are harm people And religions don't
converge they split Giving more to disagree upon And there is a lot
of disagreement to whom one should be tolerant or if one should be
tolerant at all

Ideologies also split giving more to disagree upon and may also lead
to intolerance  So do you also oppose all ideologies

I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all but
just points out the weaknesses of human nature

 Do women have souls in Islam

People have said here that some Muslims say that women do not have
souls  I must admit I have never heard of such a view being held by
Muslims of any era  I have heard of some Christians of some eras
holding this viewpoint but not Muslims  Are you sure you might not be
confusing Christian history with Islamic history
 
Yes it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the Turkish
Caliphate

I would like a reference if you have got one for this is news to me

Anyhow that women are the spiritual equals of men can be clearly shown
from many verses of the Qur'an  For example the Qur'an says

For Muslim men and women 
for believing men and women
for devout men and women
for true men and women
for men and women who are patient and constant
for men and women who humble themselves
for men and women who give in charity
for men and women who fast and deny themselves
for men and women who guard their chastity
and for men and women who engage much in God's praise 
For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward

Qur'an  Abdullah Yusuf Ali's translation

There are other quotes too but I think the above quote shows that men
and women are spiritual equals and thus that women have souls just as
men do very clearly

 
No it does not It implies that they have souls but it does not say they
have souls And it is not given that the quote above is given a high
priority in all interpretations

One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence  Any thinking approach
to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it
that women and men are spiritual equals

I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have
souls  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be
forgiven  Or to have a great reward understood to be in the
afterlife  I think the usual answer would be no  in which case the
part saying For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward
says they have souls  

If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven then 
I have no idea what a soul is

As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority
in all interpretations any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give
all verses of the Qur'an equal priority  That is because according to
Muslim belief the whole Qur'an is the revelation of God  in fact
denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be
considered a disbeliever in Islam

Quite similar to you other post even when the Quran does not encourage
slavery it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to
slavery It is a non sequitur

Look any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and
thought  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the
Quran's message  In a book of finite length it cannot explicitly
answer every question you want to put to it but through its teachings
it can guide you  I think however that women are the spiritual equals
of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse and that
since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they must have
souls from the above verse

Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach rather than
try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this
passage or that passage  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on
ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite but the interpretations 
fully consistent are more limited  Let's try to discuss these
interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can
ignore this bit or that bit for that is just showing how people can try
to twist Islam for their own ends  something I do not deny  but
provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever

In Aprennewseasasuedu guncerenuxhaeasasuedu Selim Guncer  writes

You might not like what Bernard Lewis writes about label him
as a Zionist or such to discredit him etc 

You misrepresent me Selim  The hard evidence for my statements about
his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book
Orientalism by Edward Said  Edward Said by the way is a Christian
not a Muslim

I think he is
pretty much objective in his treatment in Race and Slavery in
the Middle East since he clearly distinguishes between
slavery under Islam and the practice of slavery in other countries
like the US prior to the civil war He also does not conceal
that there are verses in the Quran which promote the liberation
of slaves What he doesn't and I don't think nobody can
deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be
abolished in Islamic countries Now you might rather conveniently
blame the practice of slavery on Muslims but the facts are out
there I also fail to see the relevance of the claim of Lewis being
a Zionist to what I wrote 

Regarding Bernard Lewis

Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his
giving misrepresentations and halftruths about Islam

Read Orientalism by Edward Said  see the evidence for yourself

In fact I may post some of it here if it isn't too long

They were encyclopaedic information
which anybody can access  that slavery was abolished at certain
dates some  years after Muhammed that this was the cause
of tensions in the Ottoman empire between the Arab slave traders
and the government etc We also have in the ASU library volumes
of British documents on slavery where reports and documents
concerning slavery all around the world can be found which I
checked some of the incidents Lewis mentions So I don't think
ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence

I haven't read Lewis's article so I can't comment directly upon it and
have only spoken about his writings in general so far that his
political motives make him a biased writer on Islam  His antiIslamic
polemics as I understand it are often quite subtle and are often based
on telling halftruths

Again read Orientalism by Edward Said  I am not asking you to take
what I say on trust in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get
this book it is a wellknown book and check the evidence out for
yourself

The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES
when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extramarital sex
I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines I wrote an
incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not
want his concubine to get pregnant etc which is contrary
to the notion that sex is for procreation only In other
words such claims are baseless in the Quran and the Hadith

If slavery is in reality as opposed to in the practice of some
Muslims opposed by Islam then using slaves for sexual
purposes is necessarily opposed too

I seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you Islam is
not advocating slavery Slavery was an existing institution in the 
th century It advised on slaves being freed for good
deeds etc which is nothing new Many cultures saw this as a
good thing What is the problem here But I can argue rightfully
that slaves were discouraged about thinking about their statuses
politically  the Quran rewards the good slave so obey your
master and perhaps one day you'll be free  But it is very
understandable that I do not communicate with Muslims since
they assume the Quran is from a God and I think it is a rulebased
system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo
Slaves are a part of this system the subordination of women
so that their function in society boils down to childmaking
is a part of this system etc 

I understand your point of view Selim  I think rather it is us
who are not getting through to you

Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before

Regarding women I have made posting after posting on this subject
showing that Islam is not antiwoman etc  However have you been
completely ignoring my postings or just missing them  I just reposted a
very good one under the title Islam and Women reposted from
socreligionislam  If this has already disappeared from your site
then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this
excellent article  

IMHO your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient

Regarding slaves my posting on slavery  the second one I made
which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year  is based
completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and
hadiths to support its point of view

Our approaches are different  you are arguing from a historical
standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an
and hadiths  Now just because people say they are Muslims and perform
a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is
part of Islam even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah  No  Of
course not

Let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for
you  The Qur'an prohibits drinking  Now if a person says I am a
Muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean
that Islam teaches that people should drink beer  Of course not and
only an idiot would think so

Do you see my point

It is very natural to think that
the authorauthors of the Quran had no idea that the socioeconomic
structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm
shifts in  years in the western cultures  first with the end of 
the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial 
revolution  Well rules have changed and the status quo has driven 
Muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a heathen world 
Muslim countries have failed economically they were unable to 
accumulate any wealth  directly due to the uncomprimising economic
rules in the Quran In fact the rise of Islam can easily be modeled
after the pyramid effect  you do not produce any wealth at home
but increase your wealth by conquering places  

You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms  Capitalism is an
ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise
their wealth  this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings
To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking 
Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be
capitalist  This does not mean that Islam does not support a
freemarket  for it does in general  but there are other parts of 
capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it

When this stopped
you and I were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour
No capital no industry very poor social services  the education
level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world the health
statistics are miserable etc 

One can postulate numerous reasons for this  Your theory is that it is
because Islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc

Selim I will give you a clear historical example to show you the
fallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do that
Islam  lack of education and power

For a large part of history the Islamic world was very powerful  For a
significant section of history the Islamic world was the foremost in
the sciences  So to say that Islam is for example antieducation is
completely absurd  You try to blame this situation on Islam  history
shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be
other reasons for this situation

You blame Muslims for not following the Quran but I blame Muslims 
for following the Quran 

Well Selim your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent
of your knowledge of Islam  I really think you are not
knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are
following the Qur'an or not

Your idea is baseless from historical
facts it is a poor utopia 

The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one
stage  yet somehow in your theory it is by following the Qur'an
that Muslims are backwards in education  Selim it is your thesis
that is antihistorical for you conveniently overlook this historical
fact which contradicts your theory 

while my ideas are derived from social
and economic history 

You have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it
So far it seems to me that your view on Islam being antieducation is
quite contrary to history  That you are so convinced of your views
makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of
this

My solution to all Muslims is simple
CUT THE CRAP 

I think Selim you should consider taking your own advice

GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT 

Here too

AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE
THE EFFECTS OF  YEARS OF IGNORANCE

Selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate
ignorance not only of Islam but also of Islamic history particularly
with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about  or so I
think  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history

Selim if I remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that
you are an apostate from Islam  I think you should slow down and start
thinking clearly about the issues and start reading some of our
postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously
have

In article Aprbmerhbnrca dgrahambmersbnrca Douglas Graham writes
The poster casually trashed two thousand years of Jewish history and 
Ken replied that there had previously been people like him in Germany

I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part
about the Jews sightseeing for  years thinking instead that
the important part of what the original poster said was the bit
about killing Palestinians  In retrospect I can see how the
sightseeing thing would be offensive to many  I originally saw
it just as poetic license but it's understandable that others
might see it differently  I still think that Ken came on a bit
strong though  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan

  Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee it's a good idea to
  do a little homework or at least think

was unnecessary

That's right   There have been    There have also been people who
were formally Nazis   But the Nazi party would have gone nowhere
without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the
street who behaved as though casual antisemitism was perfectly
acceptable

Now what exactly don't you understand about what I wrote and why
don't you see what it has to do with the matter at hand

Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit
assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual
antisemitism  If I agreed with that then maybe your speech
on why this is bad might have been relevant  But I think you're
reading a lot into one flip sentence  While probably not
true in this case too often the charge of antisemitism gets
thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the
state of Israel

Anyway I'd rather be somewhere else so I'm outta this thread

This file contains responses to articles which occur repeatedly in
altatheism  Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the
Introduction to Atheism you are advised to read that article as well
before posting

These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive The purpose of
the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate but to raise its level If
you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't
covered by the answer given please feel free to make your point

Subject What is the purpose of this newsgroup

Typical posting

Why have a newsgroup about atheism  Why do atheists organize in groups  
What is there to discuss

Response

Many things are discussed here including

 Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's
  family
 Prayer in schools
 Discrimination against atheists
 Sunday trading laws
 The Satanic Child Abuse myth
 Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'
 How religious societies prey sic on new college students
 How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers
 Whether religion is a danger to society andor the individual
 Why people become atheists

Of course inevitably altatheism tends to attract evangelical Christians
looking for someone to convert  Most readers of the newsgroup don't 
want to be preached to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure 
from tearing apart particularly illconsidered or uninformed postings



Subject Hitler was an atheist

Typical posting

Hitler was an atheist and look at what he did

Response

Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist  As he said himself

   The folkishminded man in particular has the sacred duty each in
   his own denomination of making peoplestopjusttalking
   superficiallyofGod'swillandactuallyfulfillGod'swilland
   notletGod'swordbedesecratedorig ital

   For God's will gave men their form their essence and their
   abilities  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the
   Lord's creation the divine will  Therefore let every man be
   active each in his own denomination if you please and let every
   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who
   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his
   religious community and tries to butt into the other

   

   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will
   of the Almighty Creator bydefendingmyselfagainsttheJewIam
   fightingfortheworkoftheLordorig ital

           Adolf Hitler from Mein Kampf trans Ralph Mannheim

Of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief
wrong  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed 
to believe in God  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist 
though



Subject The Bible proves it

Typical posting

In the Bible it says that

Response

Most of the readers of altatheism feel that the Bible is of questionable
accuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were
recording oral tradition that existed many years before  Thus any claimed
'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy  This isn't to say that The
Bible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before being
accepted

Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is
subject to interpretation any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and
one thing only is not legitimate

Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books

It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other
equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion



Subject Pascal's Wager

Typical posting

If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing 
but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you will go to
hell Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist

Response

This argument is known as Pascal's Wager  It has several flaws

Firstly it does not indicate which religion to follow  Indeed there are
many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there  This is often
described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem  If a person is a
follower of religion X he may end up in religion Y's version of hell

Secondly the statement that If you believe in God and turn out to be
incorrect you have lost nothing is not true  Suppose you're believing in
the wrong God  the true God might punish you for your foolishness
Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in
favour of prayer

Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that 
the two possibilities are equally likely  or at least that they are of 
comparable likelihood  If in fact the possibility of there being a God 
is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive  So sadly the
argument is only likely to convince those who believe already

Also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on 
evidence with some amount of intuition  It is not a matter of will or 
costbenefit analysis

Formally speaking the argument consists of four statements

   One does not know whether God exists
   Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does
     exist
   Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist
   Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God

There are two approaches to the argument  The first is to view  as an
assumption and  as a consequence of it  One problem with this approach in
the abstract is that it creates information from no information  This is
considered invalid in information theory  Statement  indicates one has no
information about God  but statement  indicates that beneficial information
can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God  This violates
information entropy  information has been extracted from no information at
no cost

The alternative approach is to claim that  and  are both assumptions  The
problem with this is that  is then basically an assumption which states the
Christian position and only a Christian will agree with that assumption The
argument thus collapses to If you are a Christian it is in your interests
to believe in God  a rather vacuous tautology and not the way Pascal
intended the argument to be viewed

The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is
omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as
a wager  He will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all
whether people believe in him



Subject What is Occam's Razor

Typical posting

People keep talking about Occam's Razor  What is it

Response

William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's 
Razor  In its original form it said Do not multiply entities 
unnecessarily  That is if you can explain something without supposing
the existence of some entity then do so

Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor they generally express it 
more generally for example as Take the simplest solution

The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations 
for what we see around us

 There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which
came into being as a result of natural processes

 There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and 
there is also a God who created the universe  Clearly this God must be 
of nonzero complexity

Given that both explanations fit the facts Occam's Razor might suggest 
that we should take the simpler of the two  solution number one
Unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution

 There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there  
We just imagine that there is

This third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people 
find unacceptable
 


Subject Why it's good to believe in Jesus

Typical posting

I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion

Response

Preaching is not appreciated

Feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that
are on a conversion theme  Such postings do not belong on altatheism and
will be rejected from altatheismmoderated try the newsgroup
talkreligionmisc

You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite
newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto others as you would
have them do unto you

Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy
analogies or parables  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the
basic claims about him if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell
atheists that God exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it
since it tells us nothing we have not been told before



Subject Why I know that God exists

Typical posting

I know from personal experience and prayer that God exists

Response

Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship
exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not
exist  That evidence varies from person to person

Furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many
people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things  that they have been
abducted by UFOs visited by the ghost of Elvis and so on



Subject Einstein and God does not play dice

Typical posting

Albert Einstein believed in God  Do you think you're cleverer than him

Response

Einstein did once comment that God does not play dice with the universe 
This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the
Christian God  Used this way it is out of context it refers to Einstein's
refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory Furthermore
Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian

A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following
I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of
what exists not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of
human beings

Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an
objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random
events and which would not be dependent upon the observer  He believed that
QM was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for
statistical interpretations  So far no such better theory has been found
and much evidence suggests that it never will be

A longer quote from Einstein appears in Science Philosophy and Religion A
Symposium published by the Conference on Science Philosophy and Religion
in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life Inc New York   In
it he says

  The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events
   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side
   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature  For him
   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an
   independent cause of natural events  To be sure the doctrine of a
   personal God interfering with natural events could never be
   refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this
   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific
   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot

   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives
   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal  For a doctrine
   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark
   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm
   to human progress  In their struggle for the ethical good teachers
   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal
   God that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past
   placed such vast power in the hands of priests  In their labors they
   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable
   of cultivating the Good the True and the Beautiful in humanity
   itself  This is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably
   more worthy task

Einstein has also said

  It was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions
   a lie which is being systematically repeated  I do not believe in a
   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly
   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the
   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our
   science can reveal it

The latter quote is from Albert Einstein The Human Side edited by Helen 
Dukas and Banesh Hoffman and published by Princeton University Press  
Also from the same book

  I do not believe in immortality of the individual and I consider ethics
   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind 
   it

Of course the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does 
not in itself imply that Christianity is false



Subject Everyone worships something

Typical posting

Everyone worships something whether it's money power or God

Response

If that is true everyone is a polytheist  Theists care just as much about
those things that atheists care about  If the atheists' reactions to for
example their families amount to worship then so do the theists'



Subject Why there must be a causeless cause

Typical posting

Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so
chains of causes must all have a first element a causeless cause

Response

The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has
no smallest member

Further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does
not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and
especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by
any particular religion



Subject The universe is so complex it must have been designed

Typical posting

The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God  Surely you
don't think all this appeared here just by chance

Response

This is known as the Argument From Design

It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the
universe Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living
creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the
newsgroup talkorigins for a while

There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here
However the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of
socalled Scientific Creationism Furthermore there is much evidence
observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the
universe and life on earth

The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of
something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that
surely it can't have come about by chance that surely there must be some 
external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos
deliberately

But if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind
capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must
be immeasurably more unlikely  The approach used to argue in favour of the
existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist
position

This leads us to the familiar theme of If a creator created the universe
what created the creator but with the addition of spiralling 
improbability  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not
created and just is or was

From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe
just is without introducing a creator  Indeed Stephen Hawking in his book
A Brief History of Time explains his theory that the universe is closed
and finite in extent with no beginning or end

The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy in the socalled 
Watchmaker Argument  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on
the beach  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it
evolved naturally  Of course one assumes a watchmaker  Yet like the 
watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the 
universe too must have a creator

The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above 
those common to all Arguments By Design  Firstly a watchmaker creates 
watches from preexisting materials whereas God is claimed to have 
created the universe from nothing  These two sorts of creation are 
clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak

Secondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in 
the world  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear 
reactor we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker  The argument 
would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a 
different part of creation

Finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that 
the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore 
stands out from the randomness of nature  Yet in the second part of the 
argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not 
random but shows elements of order  The Watchmaker argument is thus 
internally inconsistent



Subject Independent evidence that the Bible is true

Typical posting

The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary
evidence  For example

Response

The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary
evidence

Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or
James the extant version discusses John in a nonChristian context  Many
scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing but
that this was expanded by Christian copyists  Several reconstructions of
the original text have been published to this effect

Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius about 
CE  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate
falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the
first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity' It is Eusebius who is
generally given the title of authorship for this material

Aside from the New Testament the biographical information about Jesus is
more welldocumented  For further information please consult the Frequently
Asked Questions file for the newsgroup socreligionchristian



Subject Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

Typical posting

Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the
Bible to be both true and complete

Response

Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal 
system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary 
arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be 
valid or invalid 'true' or 'false' within that formal system  Technically
speaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision
procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal 
system

Essentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a Liar 
Paradox  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is This 
sentence is false  Note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal 
system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable

The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims
that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to
prove or disprove the existence of God are worthless in isolation

One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the
existence of God simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom 
This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof however

It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms
that both atheists and theists agree with  It may then be possible to show
that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system  However that
would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists
within the system  Furthermore it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about
whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally

Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about
the actual existence of God the formal systems are just abstractions

Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates
that a religious text the Bible the Book of Mormon or whatever cannot be
both consistent and universally applicable Religious texts are not formal
systems so such claims are nonsense



Subject George Bush on atheism and patriotism

Typical posting

Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens

Response

The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I
Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush on August   Sherman
is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of
the press corps  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce
federal disaster relief for Illinois  The discussion turned to the
presidential primary

 RS What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists

 GB I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community  Faith in
      God is important to me

 RS Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of
      Americans who are atheists

 GB No I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens
      nor should they be considered patriots  This is one nation under
      God

 RS Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation
      of state and church

 GB Yes I support the separation of church and state  I'm just not
      very high on atheists

UPI reported on May   that various atheist organizations were
still angry over the remarks

The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 
  It can also be found in Free Enquiry magazine Fall  issue
Volume  Number  page 

On October   Mr Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane
cochairman of the BushQuayle ' Illinois campaign  This concerned a
lawsuit Mr Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School
District  Chicago Illinois from forcing his firstgrade Atheist son to
pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as one nation under God
Bush's phrase  The following conversation took place
 
 RS American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday
      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing
 
 EM It's bullshit
 
 RS What is bullshit
 
 EM Everything that American Atheists does Rob is bullshit
 
 RS Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush
      campaign is on this issue

 EM You're welcome

After Bush's election American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract
his statement  On February st  C Boyden Gray Counsel to the
President replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by
his original statement and wrote

  As you are aware the President is a religious man who neither supports
   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or
   supported by the government

Atheist Press's Cameron Road address



Subject I know where hell is

Typical posting

I know where Hell is  Hell is in Norway

Response

There are several towns called Hell in various countries around the
world including Norway and the USA  Whilst this information is mildly
amusing the first time one hears it readers of altatheism are now 
getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week



Subject Biblical contradictions wanted

Typical posting

Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions

Response
 
American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical
contradictions See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for
details

There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the
archiveservermantiscouk See the contacts file for more information



Subject The USA is a Christian nation

Typical posting

Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers shouldn't the
United States be considered a Christian nation

Response

Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers it is clear
that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation  Here are some
quotes there are many more

  What influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society
   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the
   ruins of the civil authority on many instances they have been seen
   upholding the thrones of political tyranny in no instance have they been
   the guardians of the liberties of the people  Rulers who wish to subvert
   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient
   auxiliaries A just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it
   needs them not
       James Madison A Memorial and Remonstrance 

  I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of
   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preservedthe Cross
   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced
       John Adams in a letter to Thomas Jefferson

  History I believe furnishes no example of a priestridden people
   maintaining a free civil government  This marks the lowest grade of
   ignorance of which their political as well as religious leaders will
   always avail themselves for their own purpose

       Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt 

  I cannot conceive otherwise than that He the Infinite Father expects or
   requires no worship or praise from us but that He is even infinitely
   above it

       Benjamin Franklin from Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion
        Nov  



Subject The USA is not a Christian nation

Typical posting

Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any
sense founded upon the Christian religion

Response

No  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the  Treaty
of Tripoli  Stat  Treaty Series 

   Article 

   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense
   founded on the Christian Religion  as it has in itself no character of
   enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of Musselmen  and as
   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility
   against any Mehomitan nation it is declared by the parties that no
   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption
   of the harmony existing between the two countries

The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections
such as Charles Bevans' Treaties and Other International Agreements of the
United States of America  vol  pp 

The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the US Senate on
June   and ratified by President John Adams on June    It was
recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the
quotation it lacks Article XI altogether

The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow Consul
General at Algiers a close friend of Thomas Paine  and an opponent of
Christianity  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI but since there
is no Arabic version of that article to be found it's hard to say

In  a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the
quotation

                       Constructing a Logical Argument

Although there is much argument on Usenet the general quality of argument
found is poor  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to
logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate

Logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference Concise
OED  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether
it is correct or not valid or invalid  Of course one does not need to
study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic
knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an
argument

Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally
applicable  The matter is very much open for debate  This document merely
explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is
the right tool for the job

Propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument A
proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example It is
raining or Today is Tuesday  Propositions may be either asserted said to
be true or denied said to be false  Note that this is a technical meaning
of deny not the everyday meaning

The proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular
arrangement of words used to express it  So God exists and There exists a
God both express the same proposition

An argument is to quote the Monty Python sketch a connected series of
statements to establish a definite proposition  An argument consists of
three stages

First of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to
continue are stated  These are called the premises of the argument  They
are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions 

Premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because
since obviously and so on  The phrase obviously is often viewed with
suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious
premises  If something doesn't seem obvious to you don't be afraid to
question it  You can always say Oh yes you're right it is obvious when
you've heard the explanation

Next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known
as inference  In inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of
one or more other propositions already accepted  There are various forms of
valid inference

The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further
inference  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or
therefore

Finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument  the proposition which
is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference  Conclusions are often
indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude
and so on  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference

For example

Every event has a cause premise
The universe has a beginning premise
All beginnings involve an event premise
This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference
Therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion

Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another
argument  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with
respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation

Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example
the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated 
afterwards in support of the conclusion  This is perfectly valid if 
sometimes a little confusing

Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or
conclusions  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever
producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument  Some
statements look like arguments but are not  For example

If the Bible is accurate Jesus must either have been insane an evil liar
 or the Son of God

This is not an argument it is a conditional statement  It does not assert
the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its 
conclusion  It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we'll
come to those later

Another example

God created you therefore do your duty to God

The phrase do your duty to God is not a proposition since it is neither
true nor false  Therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an
argument

Finally causality is important  Consider a statement of the form A because
B  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence the
statement is an argument  If we're trying to establish the truth of B then
it is not an argument it is an explanation

For example

There must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not
 start  This is an argument

My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine
  This is an explanation

There are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive  A
deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions
 that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must
also be true  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid  A valid
argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the
conclusion is true

An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the
truth of the conclusion  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid
however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other
arguments and about how probable their premises are

There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive
nor inductive  However we will concentrate for the moment on deductive
arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing

It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does
not imply that its conclusion holds  This is because of the slightly 
counterintuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more
carefully

Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions  However an
argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions 
For example

   All insects have wings premise
   Woodlice are insects premise
   Therefore woodlice have wings conclusion

Here the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false 
If the argument's premises were true however the conclusion would be true 
The argument is thus entirely valid

More subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises
as in

   All fish live in the sea premise
   Dolphins are fish premise
   Therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion

However the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid
inference from true premises  We can therefore draw up a truth table for
implication

The symbol  denotes implication A is the premise B the conclusion 
T and F represent true and false respectively

Premise Conclusion Inference
   A        B        AB

   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference
   F        T         T      valid the conclusion can be true or false

   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion
                             false the inference must be invalid

   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid
                             the conclusion must be true

A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true  A sound 
argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion  Be careful not to confuse
valid arguments with sound arguments

To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require
lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy  It is simpler and probably
more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing
an argument  These pitfalls are known as fallacies

In everyday English the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs
as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs  This is fair
enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of
technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or
convincing

So for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical
argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect
when examined more closely  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being
misled by them  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be
exhaustive

ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM APPEAL TO FORCE

The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the
threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion  It
is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right 
The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer

For example
 Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible  All those who
refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell

ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM

Argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man

The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when instead of trying
to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or
people making the assertion  This is invalid because the truth of an
assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it

For example
Atheism is an evil philosophy  It is practised by Communists and murderers

Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by 
showing for example that he is a known perjurer  This is a valid way of
reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not
argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witness's
testimony is false  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the
Argumentum ad Ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list

The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person
argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of
the opponent's particular circumstances

For example
It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food  How can you argue
otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes

This is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing
the opponent's argument

This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion  For 
example

Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing 
You're white

This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem when one alleges that one's
adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is
also known as poisoning the well

ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM

Argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance  This fallacy
occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it
has not been proved false  Or equivalently when it is argued that
something must be false because it has not been proved true  Note that this
is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved
true a basic scientific principle

Examples
Of course the Bible is true  Nobody can prove otherwise

Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist  Nobody has
shown any proof that they are real

Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is
generally assumed innocent until proven guilty

Also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce
certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can 
validly be used to infer that the event did not occur  For example

A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water
to be present on the earth  The earth does not have a tenth as much water
even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles  Therefore no
such flood occurred

In science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has
not occurred  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred
however

ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM

This is the Appeal to Pity also known as Special Pleading  The fallacy is 
committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a 
conclusion accepted  For example

I did not murder my mother and father with an axe  Please don't find me
guilty I'm suffering enough through being an orphan

ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM

This is known as Appealing to the Gallery or Appealing to the People  To
commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by
appealing to a large group of people  This form of fallacy is often
characterized by emotive language  For example

Pornography must be banned  It is violence against women

The Bible must be true  Millions of people know that it is  Are you trying
to tell them that they are all mistaken fools

ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM

This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum  It consists of
asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more
likely it is that that proposition is correct

ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM

The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win
support for an assertion  For example

Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God

This line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference
to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a
discussion of that subject  For example we can distinguish quite clearly
between

Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation
and
John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent
 computer

Hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black
hole radiation to be informed  Searle is a linguist so it is questionable 
whether he is wellqualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence

THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT

The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a
particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is
inapplicable  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the
specific  For example

Christians generally dislike atheists  You are a Christian so you must
dislike atheists

This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide
every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules

CONVERSE ACCIDENT  HASTY GENERALIZATION

This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident  It occurs when one
forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not
representative of all possible cases

For example
Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian  Therefore all Christians are
insincere

SWEEPING GENERALIZATION  DICTO SIMPLICITER

A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a
particular situation in which the features of that particular situation
render the rule inapplicable  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a
hasty generalization

NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA  POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC

These are known as False Cause fallacies

The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the
cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause  For 
example

I took an aspirin and prayed to God and my headache disappeared  So God
cured me of the headache

The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to
be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event  For 
example

The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism  Therefore we must avoid
atheism for the same reasons

CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC

This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc  It asserts that
because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves
no room for other factors that may be the causes of the events

PETITIO PRINCIPII

This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the
conclusion reached

CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO

This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one
wishes to reach  Often the proposition will be rephrased so that the
fallacy appears to be a valid argument  For example

Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office  Hence any
government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job 
Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open
to blackmail  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government
office

Note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the 
conclusion  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason
for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees 
Another example is the classic

We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so  And we know that the
Bible is true because it is the word of God

COMPLEX QUESTION  FALLACY OF INTERROGATION

This is the Fallacy of Presupposition  One example is the classic loaded 
question

Have you stopped beating your wife

The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not
even been asked  This trick is often used by lawyers in crossexamination
when they ask questions like

Where did you hide the money you stole

Similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as

How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue
or
Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization

IGNORATIO ELENCHI

The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument 
supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do
with that conclusion

For example a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the
teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true  If he then argues at length
that Christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he
argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true

Sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse
emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more
favourable light

EQUIVOCATION

Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different
meanings in the same argument  For example

What could be more affordable than free software  But to make sure that it
remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a
license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable

AMPHIBOLY

Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because
of careless or ungrammatical phrasing

ACCENT

Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning  In this case
the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are
emphasized  For example consider

We should not speak ILL of our friends
and
We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS

FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION

One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts
of something must apply to the whole  For example

The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very 
lightweight

The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number
of individual items is shared by a collection of those items  For example

A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus  Therefore cars
are less environmentally damaging than buses

FALLACY OF DIVISION

The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition  Like
its opposite it exists in two varieties  The first is to assume that a
property of some thing must apply to its parts  For example

You are studying at a rich college  Therefore you must be rich

The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by
each item  For example

Ants can destroy a tree  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree

THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT

This argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful
events  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the
first event

For example
If we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin
and we'll have a nation full of drugaddicts on welfare  Therefore we cannot
legalize marijuana

A IS BASED ON B FALLACIES  IS A TYPE OF FALLACIES

These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way
similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar

Examples
Isn't history based upon faith  If so then isn't the Bible also a form of
history

Islam is based on faith Christianity is based on faith so isn't Islam a
form of Christianity

Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of
animal based on carbon chemistry so aren't dogs a form of cat

AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT

This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B B is true therefore A
is true  To understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for
implication given earlier

DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT

This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B A is false therefore B
is false  Again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is
a fallacy

Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa the latter has
the form A implies B A is false therefore B is false where A does NOT in
fact imply B at all  Here the problem is not that the implication is
invalid rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce
anything about B

CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL

This fallacy is an argument of the form If A then B therefore if B then A

ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM

This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply
because it is old or because that's the way it's always been

ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM

This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of
asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer
than something else

ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM

The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those
with more money are more likely to be right

ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM

The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or
more virtuous than one who is wealthier  This fallacy is the opposite of the
argumentum ad crumenam

ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM

This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the
more often it is heard  An argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs
constant repetition in asserting something

BIFURCATION

Also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when
one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other
alternatives exist or can exist

PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM  MANY QUESTIONS

This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex
question

NON SEQUITUR

A nonsequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises
which are not logically connected with it

RED HERRING

This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue
being discussed so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the
points being made towards a different conclusion

REIFICATION  HYPOSTATIZATION

Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing

SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF

The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or
proposition  Shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad
ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who
denies or questions the assertion being made  The source of the fallacy is
the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise

STRAW MAN

The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it
can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position
then to conclude that the original position has been demolished  It is a
fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been
made

THE EXTENDED ANALOGY

The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general
rule is being argued over  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two 
different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a 
claim that those situations are analogous to each other

This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about 
anticryptography legislation

I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it

Such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported
 Martin Luther King

Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the
 struggle for Black liberation  How dare you

TU QUOQUE

This is the famous you too fallacy  It occurs when an action is argued to
be acceptable because the other party has performed it  For instance

You're just being randomly abusive
So  You've been abusive too

                                   Overview

Welcome to altatheism and altatheismmoderated

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the
newsgroups

Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often
come up with the same questions misstatements or misconceptions and post
them to the net  In addition people often request information which has
been posted time and time again  In order to try and cut down on this the
altatheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following
titles

     AltAtheism FAQ Overview for New Readers
     AltAtheism FAQ Introduction to Atheism
     AltAtheism FAQ Frequently Asked Questions FAQ
     AltAtheism FAQ Constructing a Logical Argument
     AltAtheism FAQ Atheist Resources

This is article number   Please read numbers  and  before posting  The
others are entirely optional

If you are new to Usenet you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup
newsannouncenewusers  The articles titled A Primer on How to Work With
the Usenet Community Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet
and Hints on writing style for Usenet are particularly relevant  Questions
concerning how news works are best asked in newsnewusersquestions

If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above see the Finding
Stuff section below

These articles are free  Truly free  You may copy them and distribute them

does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating

                                Finding Stuff

All of the FAQ files should be somewhere on your news system  Here are
some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them

 Check the newsgroup altatheism  Look for subject lines starting with
   AltAtheism FAQ

 Check the newsgroup newsanswers for the same subject lines

   If you don't find anything in steps  or  your news system isn't set up
   correctly and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the
   problem

 If you have anonymous FTP access connect to rtfmmitedu 
   Go to the directory pubusenetaltatheism and you'll find the latest
   versions of the FAQ files there

   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers  If you
   need help in using or getting started with FTP send email to
   mailserverrtfmmitedu with

      send usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq

   in the body

 There are other sites which also carry newsanswers postings  The article
   Introduction to the newsanswers newsgroup carries a list of these
   sites the article is posted regularly to newsanswers

 If you don't have FTP send mail to mailserverrtfmmitedu
   consisting of the following lines

      send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources
      send usenetaltatheismfaq
      send usenetaltatheismintroduction
      send usenetaltatheismlogic
      send usenetaltatheismresources

 Penultimate resort  Send mail to mailservermantiscouk consisting of
   the following lines

      send atheismfaqfaqtxt
      send atheismfaqlogictxt
      send atheismfaqintrotxt
      send atheismfaqresourcetxt

   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files
   There's other stuff too interesting commands to try are help and
   send atheismindex

 Last resort  Mail mathewmantiscouk or post an article to the
   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files  You should only do this
   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed it's not nice to
   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files
   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ though  For instance
   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have 
   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files

	These Biblelovers have got to chill out  If we all could just relax
and see atheism for what it is the funny pages could have more material

	Atheism denies the existence of God  This is logically bankrupt 
where is the proof of this nonexistence  It's a joke

	So nobody can take the above sense of atheism seriously  Perhaps

Perhaps because you just made it up

Now put your skateboard away and read the FAQ  Learn something about atheism
before you get off on these tangents

I don't think there is really any question about which god the courts
mean  The request for solemnly swearing so help you god
 is always made after a request to pick up the bible in your left hand
and hold up your right hand  In the courts of NC at least it is always
an old and new testament

Though it is hard to imagine picking up the bible and swearing to whatever
god is sometimes the least of the religious influence  There is a court in
Greensboro NC where the judge routinely has everyone in the courtroom
stand to join him in prayer at the beginning of every session  I've thought about
sitting through it but I'm not terribly anxious to spend  days in jail

	Atheism denies the existence of God  This is logically bankrupt 
where is the proof of this nonexistence  It's a joke

 This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism ie the 
 belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist
 This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are
 conceivable but not observed to exist does this mean that we would have
 to believe in all of them  According to the above poster we must believe
 in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at
 God   there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan
 except for trivial differences say one is missing a finger one has blond
 hair and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them  The 
 reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians
 have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God

Fine but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of
a God  Here again is a classic atheist fallacy

 How did they shoot themselves in the foot

	Radical Muslims the Crusades the Inquisition are common examples that
atheists like to bring up as marks against religion  How weak  Only fools can
take that drivel seriously  How about the granddaddy of all human atrocities
the Stalinist movement
	Twenty eight MILLION people killed under this leadership which
proudly featured atheism

  There is a big difference here Stalin didn't say that he stood for a 
  particular moral position ie against murder and terrorism etc and
  then did the opposite like the religious movements he was at least
  an honest killer  This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this
  viewpoint  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because
  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic look at all the
  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists  don't they contradict
  your point  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant
  to his murdering people this is just the common assumption that atheists
  can't value life as much as theists which you didn't support  

	Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable  Yet
they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of God
is unknowable  This in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is
though it's less arrogant and pompous

 Ah and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ  An atheist
 doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist heshe may
 just have the nonexistence of the positive belief  Here's the example
 
 Strong atheism  I believe god does not exist   a positive belief

 Weak atheism    I don't believe in a god       a negative belief
 
 these are NOT the same some one that has never thought of the idea of
 god in their whole life is technically an atheist but not the kind that
 you are calling unreasonable  Or let's look at it this way in sets
 
 suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent
 as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas
 exist as real objects or not  So if S  santa then ES no is the person
 not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa  But notice that
 even ES  no  is itself another idea  This means you have lots of cases
 
 christian   AEAyesBEBno     GEGyes where G  god
 
 atheist strong  AEA    GEGno
 
 atheist weak  AE     ie no G at all in the set
 
 agnostic   AG EG  indeterminate E'  


	Why are people so afraid to say undecided  It must just be another
feature of human nature  undecided is not a sexy trendy or glamorous
word  It does not inspire much hate or conflict  It's not blasphemous
It's not political  In fact it is too often taken to mean unsophisticated

 Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not
  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always 
  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival
  trait evolution has drilled it in us to take positions even false ones

  Actually my atheism is based on ignorance  Ignorance of the

How do you know it's based on ignorance couldn't that be wrong Why would it
be wrong 
to fall into the trap that you mentioned 


  If I'm wrong god is free at any time to correct my mistake  That
  he continues not to do so while supposedly proclaiming his
  undying love for my eternal soul speaks volumes

What are the volumes that it speaks besides the fact that he leaves your 
choices up to you

  As for the trap you are not in a position to tell me that I don't
  believe in god because I do not wish to  Unless you can know my
  motivations better than I do myself you should believe me when I
  say that I earnestly searched for god for years and never found
  him

I definitely agree that it's rather presumptuous for either side to give some
psychological reasoning for another's belief

I see the point on falsifying God as per the scientific method  A question
I've always wanted to ask is this When scientists say that the second law
does not apply to the earth they say it is because it is not a closed system 
ie there is energy coming in from an outside force  namely the sun  Is 
the universe a closed or open system and how could either be proven If it is
a closed system have you been to the outside to look in  If it is open how 
do you know

The latest news seems to be that Koresh will give himself up once he's
finished writing a sequel to the Bible

In article ppsilinkcom Robert Knowles ppsilinkcom writes
Writing the Seven Seals or something along those lines  He's already
written the first of the Seven which was around  pages or so and has
handed it over to an assistant for PROOFREADING  I would expect any
decent messiah to have a builtin spellchecker  Maybe Koresh  will
come with one

I heard he had asked the FBI to provide him with a word processor  Does
anyone know if Koresh has requested that it be WordPerfect  WP was
written and is owned by Mormons so the theological implications of
requesting or refusing WP are profound

I'll yield the discussion on absolute morality until I can think of another way
to discuss it  If you're interested in a change here's an idea

If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that What right do
we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality
Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your brother and say that I was 
exercising my rights as I saw them was doing what felt good didn't want
anyone forcing their morality on me or I don't follow your morality

No  It wouldn't be sufficient cause to bitch to the system operator if this
was just some guy saying that atheists are going to hell  The point was 
that recently many messages were posted from that address  Each of these
messages was posted to a different newsgroup with the apparent intent of
provoking the readers of that particular group  This along with the fact
that these posts were written in allcaps makes these posts suspect
Whoever is using this account is using it irresponsibly  If it is the
intended user they should consider appropriate action  If it is someone
else which seems a possibility then this is also reason to report it
	We get many posts in the flavor of the one that started this thread
It is only because I have seen posts on other groups by this user that I
am considering action

 There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread
 that are a little confusing An atheist is one for whom all things can
 be understood as processes of nature  exclusively

This definition does not include all atheists see the FAQ However
I for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine or
spiritual explanations 

It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood
as natural processes and to claim that our observations do not
require us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual
for that matter Humans are not omnipotent and neither is science
However science has one advantage theology doesn't it is self
correcting with nature as its judge 

It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self
consistent simple picture of our universe Science is no longer
a bunch of separate branches it is one From particle physics to
psychology And no aspect of our life or our universe is safe
from its stern and stony eye Not even our consciousness

 There is no need
 for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything There is
 no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by
 physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is
 determnined

Actually determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical question
and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow
superdeterministic or not I think the question does not have
any meaning as far as individual human beings go If their apparent
free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their
perspective Bill can you say for sure whether you have a free
will or not 

 This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all
 its products There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it
 acquire intelligence it's just a happy accident

Maybe Who are we to tell It seems intelligence is useful  when
during the history of Earth has one species been able to control
one third of the whole biosphere This can still be a result of 
numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates
and preserves Even that machinery can be result of the same
principle  only the systems that can start replicating will
survive those which don't don't make it Recommended reading to

 For an atheist no
 event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less
 value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about
 an event can have value 

From whose perspective I value events and things subjectively from
my perspective Nature does not have values because it does not have
a perspective  values arise from awareness If I have a subjective
perspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and if
I think about what it would it be like in their position I will
eventually discover the Golden Rule Morality is not necessarily
a gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolution
Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity
is helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect
others who seem to have identity too 

Bill have you ever read Aristotle Try his Ethica Nikomakhea sp
for starters

 How then can an atheist judge value What is the basis for criticizing
 the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God On
 what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned It
 seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you
 have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what
 in nature can serve that purpose What law of nature can you invoke to
 establish your values

CS Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why
he abandoned his atheism and became Christian The argument is
severely flawed

Some values such as the Golden Rule can have a rational basis Some
others like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably its
roots in the way our brains are wired Lewis ignored the very real
possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic
behaviour and morality as well Indeed as humans evolved better
and better in building and using tools they also became better
at killing each other It is a logical necessity that evolution could
only favour those who knew how to use tools but not against one's
own people

The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews
was not beyond this A simple set of rules to hold the people
together under one god Their god did not care much about people
of other nations 

At the time of the NT things were quite different  the Jews
were under rule of an empire and could no longer simply ignore
the Gentiles A new situation required a new morality and along
with it a new religion was born A mutation in a meme pool

 Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what
 difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or
 otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value The only
 way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the
 objection is entirely subjective and that heshe just doesn't like it
  that's it Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer
 that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries
 no weight in any absolute sense

It looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy Whenever there
is an observer there is a subjective point of view which may 
value its existence and happiness even if that were just a result
of some physical event and other's happiness too if the observer
comes to think about it In an absolutely objective sense that is
without any observers or subjects moral judgments lose their
meaning 

It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of
view This includes gods too their values are only their 
personal judgments not absolute truths since such truths
do not exist 

The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others
is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence
by becoming social beings who can think and value others'
existence

Morality is not property of humans alone  chimps dolphins and
many other species show great care for each other Dolphins have
sometimes saved humans from drowning a good deed indeed 

 That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God
 or God's commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your
 nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled
 with a preexisting thoughtset to form that reaction That your
 objections seem well founded is due to the way you've been
 conditioned there is no truth content The whole of your
 intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality

The last statement does not logically follow In fact there is
every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very
well and our senses can convey reliable information Solipsism
is still a logical possibility but not a very likely one

You are continuously mixing two different views the subjective
point of view which we all share and an objective point of view
which does not exist Any observer or thinker any personal being
has its own point of view It does not matter whether this point
of view is a result of some physical events or not it does not
cease to be subjective 

From a nonobservers nonpoint of view values do not exist Neither
does pain or pleasure or beauty or love Such things are 
inherently subjective 

Once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or even
to make a leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us if
we don't I disagree with his morals I do not think my morals come
from any supreme being  to remove my morals means the same than
to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought If god
gave us morality to judge but I disagree with him it is not my
fault He is free to replace my morals I cannot see what is the
point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's
own and then to get mad at this 

God must be schizophrenic

 All of this being so you have excluded
 yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil
 etc and cannot participate Your opinion about the Bible can have no
 weight whatsoever

Neither can the opinion of any god for that matter I cannot understand
why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way
less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else

Bill take note Absolute values must be independent of any being
including gods If god has a subjective viewpoint it is his
own point of view and his morals are his own

I noticed a post on this topic in socreligionislam   And since the topic
of the BCCI beingnot being an Islamic bank has come up I have left in the
one mention of the BCCI bank called How BCCI adapted the Koran rules of
banking from this bibliography


Bennett Neil  How BCCI adapted the Koran rules of banking  The 
Times  August  

So let's see If some guy writes a piece with a title that implies
something is the case then it must be so is that it

  This is how you support a position if you intend to have anyone
  respect it Gregg  Any questions  And I even managed to include
  the above reference with my head firmly engaged in my ass  What's
  your excuse

This supports nothing I have no reason to believe that this is 
piece is anything other than another antiIslamic slander job
I have no respect for titles only for real content I can look
up this article if I want true But I can tell you BCCI was not
an Islamic bank Seeing as I'm spending my time responding to
propaganda in responding to this little subthread I really
don't feel a deep need to do more than make statements to the
effect that the propaganda is false If someone wants to discuss
the issue more seriously then I'd be glad to have a real discussion
providing references etc

I am not familiar with or knowledgeable about the original language

the original said idol  So I think you're wrong here but

The Vatican Home Of Genetic Misfits

Michael  A Gillow noted geneticist has revealed  some unusual  data
after working undercover in  the Vatican for the past  years   The
Popehattm is actually an advanced bone spur reveals Gillow in his
groundshaking report Gillow who had  secretly  studied the innermost
workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair
first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late
's

The  whole hat  thing that was just a cover  up The  Vatican didn't
want the Catholic Communitytm to realize  their  leader  was hefting
nearly   kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  his
skull notes Gillow in his report There are whole  laboratories in
the  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrow
experiments  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 's is now
scientifically engineered and bred for The whole bone transplant idea
started  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary
transplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats Gillow is quick
to point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the
disappearance of Dr  Leary from the public eye

When it becomes time to replace the pope says Gillow The old pope
and the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber They  butt
heads much  like  male yaks  fighting for dominance of the  herd  The
victor emerges and has  earned the privilege of inseminating the choir

Last night while watching the am rebroadcast of Jerry Springer a
talk show I heard this Jewel of a thought from a  year old racist 
The focus of this show was on these kids and their hatred for the Jewish
religion and why  

some stuff deleted

Interesting and scary no  They went on to say how the Jews had 
killed their god and how in the end of time that all the races would
go to their homelands of course they would remain in America which
is New Jeruselem as it says in Gen  what another kid said but
the rest of the races would go home and then the great battle or plague
or whatever Revel says would happen and the jews would be killed

The most interesting thing about this was that my roomate is Catholic 
and had the KJV of the Bible on his desk  He immediatly opened it up
and began to search for the quoted passages Gen Rev and John to 
look for himself and couldn't find what they said they saw  I don't
know

I saw this show a while back and when I heard these kids
quote the Bible to justify their racist claims I looked up
that quote about Jesus hating Jews since Jesus himself was a
Jew my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim
The jist of the passage and I am sorry but I can't recall
which passage it was exactly was that Jesus was condemning
the Pharisees for being corrupt
Of course the Pharisees were Jewish too but it wasn't Jews
as a whole that Jesus was condemning just the powers that be

a job

Of course people don't have much of a right to be proud  What have
they accomplished that can match God's accomplishments anyways  How
do their abilities compare with those of God's  We're an imbecile

Anything capable of being aware of the relationship of every aspect of every

the amazing fact is that He does care apparently and that he was

Plus questions for you  why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so 
het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism 

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism it provides more power and ability to
control events

I think you lose the right to talk about THE truth once you say values are
relative   Accuracy is a value judgement too  It so happens I agree with 
the substance of what you say below but it's clear to me that at least 
some values are objective  Truth is better than falsehood peace is
better than war education is better than ignorance  We know these things
if we know anything

Assuming for the moment that morals are relative then two
relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results

No they cannot because they acknowledge up front that THE desired
results do not exist  That after all is the meaning of compromise

Plus some problems If the relativists have no values in common compromise 
is impossible  what happens then    Who if anyone is right  What happens 
if one relativist has a value Never compromise  A value plant bombs in 
crowded shopping areas  After all if morals are relative these values 
cannot meaningfully be said to be incorrect

Assuming that there is an absolute morality two disagreeing 
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right there
is no room for compromise  Once you beleive in absolute morals
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral

Untrue  One can accept that one does not know the whole truth  Part
of the objective truth about morality may well be that flexibility is
better than rigidity compromise is better than believing you have a lock
on morals etc  In the same way I can believe in an objective reality
without claiming to know the mechanism for quantum collapse or who shot
JFK

Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention
I'd say that compromise seems to be better

And I would agree   But it's bloody to pointless to speak of it if it's
merely a matter of taste  Is your liking for peace any better founded
than someone else's liking for icecream  I'm looking for a way to say
yes to that question and relativism isn't it

I think that you are changing the meaning of values here Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word

value n  A fair equivalent or return for something such as goods
or service  Monetary or material worth  Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance merit  A principle standard or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable  Precise meaning as
of a word  An assigned or calculated numerical quantity  Mus 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest  The relative darkness or
lightness of a color  The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound 

In context of a moral system definition four seems to fit best In terms
of scientific usage definitions six or eight might apply Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing

No I'm using definition  or perhaps  in both cases  If there
is no objective worth usefulness or importance then science has no 
objective worth usefulness or importance  If nothing is inherently
worthwhile or desirable then simple theories with accurate predictions
are not inherently worthwhile or desirable Do you see any flaws in this

If on the other hand some things have objective worth usefulness
or importance it would be interesting to know what they are

If you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will
be a good beginning

I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective
basis for the notion that science is useful worthy or important in
dealing with observed facts  Alternatively you could try to
demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful worthy
or important in any situation   In other words I need to know
how you use the term objective

Really  You don't know what objective value is  If I offered the people

Well that would depend on how much we wanted the US and how much
we wanted the  wouldn't it

Yes it would  Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality  If I can
predict with almost  accuracy that Americans prefer to own their portions of
the US than an infinitesmal portion of  in what sense are these values

better than nothing is a rational and objective valuation Do you agree
with me then that the assertion no values are objective is false

I don't see anything special about theism in general that makes it a 
particular hazard more so than say stupidity anarchy or patriotism   
Of course it depends on the religion but I see nothing about believing 
in gods that in and of itself entails or even promotes xenophobia genocide 
etc  

  If the emphasis is on the in general then of course you're
  correct since you haven't really said anything  If we restrict
  our observations to practiced religions there are lots of
  examples of god mandated genocide  Just ask the Canaanites  The
  point is that if you believe in a god and if you believe he has
  ordered you to eliminate an entire race you will likely make the
  attempt  After all if it was OK in the past it could surely be
  OK in the present

Hmmmm  Define objective morality  Well depends upon who you talk to
Some say it means you can't have your hair over your ears and others say
it means Stryper is acceptable  I would say that general principles
of objective morality would be listed in one or two places

Ten Commandments
Sayings of Jesus

the first depends on whether you trust the Bible 
the second depends on both whether you think Jesus is God and whether
  you think we have accurate copies of the NT
Gong
Take a moment and look at what you just wrote First you defined
an objective morality and then you qualified this objective morality
with subjective justifications Do you see the error in this
Sorry you have just disqualified yourself but please play again

I'm afraid it's much worse than this Jesus said follow the Ten
Commandments AND the Torah And the Prophets Christians on the other
hand are not only above the Ten Commandments AND the Torah AND the
Prophets ie they believe that they do not have to follow it they
don't even follow the subjective morality of Jesus So we see that
Christians can't follow the objective morality of their own Ten
Commandments they can't follow the subjective morality of Jesus when
He said follow the Ten Commandments yet they expect the rest of the
world to do what Is there any logic here Is there any morality here
objective or subjective Is Christianity somebody's idea of a joke Who
could be pulling the wool over the eyes of so many Christians Who could
be such a great deceiver

   Hello I just started reading this group today and I think I am going
 to be a large participant in its daily postings I liked the section of
 the FAQ about constructing logical arguments  well done I am an atheist
 but I do not try to turn other people into atheists I only try to figure
 why people believe the way they do  I don't much care if they have a 
 different view than I do When it comes down to it    I could be wrong
 I am willing to admit the possibility  something religious followers 
 dont seem to have the capability to do

Welcome aboard

 
   I notice alot of posts from Bobby Why does anybody ever respond to 
 his posts  He always falls back on the same argument

I think you just answered your own question there

 
 If the religion is followed it will cause no bad
 
   He is right Just because an event was explained by a human to have been
 done in the name of religion does not mean that it actually followed
 the religion He will always point to the ideal and say that it wasn't
 followed so it can't be the reason for the event There really is no way
 to argue with him so why bother Sure you may get upset because his 
 answer is blind and not supported factually  but he will win every time
 with his little argument I don't think there will be any postings from
 me in direct response to one of his

Most responses were against his postings that spouted the fact that
all atheists are foolsevil for not seeing how peachy Islam is
I would leave the procon arguments of Islam to Fred Rice who is more
level headed and seems to know more on the subject anyway

 
   Happy to be aboard 

How did you know I was going to welcome you abord

Is good logic better than bad  Is good science better than bad  

	By definition

True enough  OK in the universe we have today which is better a science
that predicts the motion of the planets and it happens so or a science
which predicts that sonic the hedgehog will record an album with Elvis on
a certain date and it doesn't happen  Can the answer to this question
be called objective or is it a matter of opinion

	Yes

	If one's particular goal is to land a man on the moon or to 
put a communication sattelite into a orbit within which it will operate 
then orbital astronomy will be more important

	However if one is a particular fan Sonic's singing or a competator 
of Sonic say Mario and the Toadstools knowing when he will record an ablum 
would be more important

	I fail to see how this is connected in any way nor where you are 
driving too

  Truth is better than falsehood 

	So if you were housing a Jew in your home in Holand  and
the SS troopers asks if you are housing a Jew is it objectively better to
tell the truth  I am holding a Jew  than a falsehood  No I am not
holding a Jew

	In this case let us assume that if you lie the SS trooper leaves
never to bother you Either way nothing is ever done to you no prison 
trouble etc

	Of course if you tell the truth then the Jew will be executed

	Is it better to tell the truth or lie
	




	 In this case I would consider not saying anything to be a lie
Or at the very least it implies that falsehood is on the same level of 
telling the truth Or we can stipulate that the SS have methods to make you 
say something only they can not control whether or not you say yes or
no Only that you will say one or the other

	Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows  Who would 
die for a lie  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar  People 
gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing 
someone who was or had been healed  Call me a fool but I believe he did 
heal people  

Anyone who dies for a cause runs the risk of dying for a lie  As for
people being able to tell if he was a liar well we've had grifters and
charlatans since the beginning of civilization  If David Copperfield had
been the Messiah I bet he could have found plenty of believers  
Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer and he wasn't the
first to be witnessed  What sets him apart

	Niether was he a lunatic  Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
to someone who was crazy  Very doubtful in fact rediculous  For example 
anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see 
this right away

Rubbish  Nations have followed crazies liars psychopaths and 
megalomaniacs throughout history  Hitler Tojo Mussolini Khomeini
Qadaffi Stalin Papa Doc and Nixon come to mindall from this century
Koresh is a nonissue


	Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the 
real thing  

Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course  There are flaws in your
logic everywhere  And as I'm sure others will tell you read the FAQ


	Some other things to note  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in 
the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone  This in his betrayal 
and Crucifixion  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I 
write I will use it

Of course you have to believe the Bible first  Just because something is
written in the Bible does not mean it is true and the age of that tome plus
the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible  So if you
do quote from the Bible in the future try to back up that quote with 
supporting evidence  Otherwise you will get flamed mercilessly


	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is  It 
is certainly not what I see a lot in churches  Rather I think it 
should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's 
sake  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the 
same  Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives 
over to him  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it to be a 
real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at  But 
just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes 
time  We don't rush it in one day Christianity is your whole life  
It is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in 
a while  We box everything into time units  Such as work at this 
time sports Tv social life  God is above these boxes and should be 
carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for 
ourselves  	  

Just like weight lifting or guitar playing eh  I don't know how you 
define the world total but I would imagine a total sacrafice sp
of everything for God's sake would involve more than a time commitment

You are correct about our tendency to box everything into time units
Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and hehehe

 Objective morality is morality built from objective values

You now pushed down the defintion of objectivity into realm of
objective values So you need to explain that as well as well
as the objective subparts the objective atoms quarks
Firstly science has its basis in values not the other way round
You keep saying that I do not think it means what you think it
means
Perhaps you should explain what you think science has it's basis
in values means The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy

It's partly as you say the reason why people do science is that they value it's
results  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else  One cannot attach
any objective worth to the results of science  for the simple reason
that one cannot attach objective worth to anything  

However not only are the outputs of science subjectively valued so are
the inputs  More problems  Which facts to observe   What
is a fact  When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather
than noise  How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I
do  As a loyal relativist I must assume that what's signal for me
may not be signal for you  The objectivity postulate should not sit
well with me

So the relativist attends to a system designed at whim fed with what should 
be assumed to be conflicting data in the expectation of results which need 
satisfy noone  GIGO

So you better explain what objective atoms are and how we get them
from subjective values before we go any further
See above

 Note to readers outside ta    
 
 taite has been advocating violent civil disobedience in the US
 in order to promote his view that abortion should be illegal  Given the
 necessity and the opportunity I would have no objection to forcing 
 morality on him if that's what it would take to prevent him carrying out
 his stated desire to hang women who have multiple abortions 

What do you mean when you say I would have no objection

Do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates
the use of force

Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such
people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing
that our own actions in doing so are not moral

  Did you read the FAQs

  If NO Read the FAQs

  IF YES you wouldn't have posted such drivel  The Lord Liar
    or Lunatic argument is a false trilemma  Even if you disprove
    Liar and Lunatic which you haven't you have not eliminated
    the other possibilities such as Mistaken Misdirected or
    Misunderstood  You have arbitrarily set up three and only
    three possibilities without considering others

  Read a good book on rhetoric and critical thinking  If
    you think the Lord Liar or Lunatic discussion is an
    example of a good argument you are in need of learning

  Read the FAQs again especially Constructing a Logical
    Argument

Ignore these instructions at your peril  Disobeying them
leaves you open for righteous flaming

 Oh this all sounds so nice  Everyone helping each other and always smiling
 and fluffy bunnies everywhere  Wake up  People are just not like that  It
 seems evident from history that no society has succeeded when it had to rely
 upon the goodwill and unselfishness of the people  Isn't it obvious from
 places like Iran that even if there are only a few greedy people in society
 then they are going to be attracted to positions of power  Sounds like a
 recipe for disaster

Looking at historical evidence such 'perfect utopian' islamic states
didn't survive I agree people are people and even if you might
start an Islamic revolution and create this perfect state it takes 
some time and the internal corruption will destroy the ground rules 
again

 Anyhow on the basis of the apparent success of Islamic banks it seems
 to me that the statement that a zerointerest economy cannot survive in
 today's world may be a bit premature

I'm sure zerointested economical systems survive on a smallscale
coops is not an Islamic invention and we have cooperatives working
all around the world However such systems don't stand the corruption
of a large scale operation Actually nothing could handle human
greed IMHO Not even Allah

   He is right Just because an event was explained by a human to have been
 done in the name of religion does not mean that it actually followed
 the religion He will always point to the ideal and say that it wasn't
 followed so it can't be the reason for the event There really is no way
 to argue with him so why bother Sure you may get upset because his 
 answer is blind and not supported factually  but he will win every time
 with his little argument I don't think there will be any postings from
 me in direct response to one of his

Hey Glad to have some serious and constructive contributors in this
newsgroup I agree  on the statement above you might argue with
Bobby for eons and he still does not get it so the best thing is
to spare your mental resources to discuss more interesting issues

  Does the term heroworship mean anything to you  

Yes worshipping Jesus as the supersaver is indeed heroworshipping
of the grand scale Worshipping Lenin that will make life pleasant
for the working people is eh somehow similar or what
 
  I understand that gods are defined to be supernatural not merely
     superhuman
The notion of Lenin was on the borderline of supernatural insights
into how to change the world he wasn't a communist God but he was
the man who gave presents to kids during Christmas
 
 Actually I agree Things are always relative and you can't have 
 a direct mapping between a movement and a cause However the notion
 that communist Russia was somewhat the typical atheist country is 
 only something that Robertson Tilton et rest would believe in
 
 Those atheists were not True Unbelievers huh   

Don't know what they were but they were fanatics indeed

 	First I want to start right out and say that I'm a Christian  It 
 makes sense to be one  Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book liar 
 lunatic or the real thing  I might be a little off on the title but he 
 writes the book  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity 
 in the process he became a Christian himself

Seems he didn't understand anything about realities liar lunatic
or the real thing is a very narrow view of the possibilities of Jesus
message

Sigh it seems religion makes your mindbrain filter out anything
that does not fit into your personal scheme 

So anyone that thinks the possibilities with Jesus is bound to the
classical Lewis notion of 'liar lunatic or saint' is indeed bound
to become a Christian

Similarly a person viewing an anonymous piece of land and a

These values are essentially subjective and that's why we have
markets to allow people to match their valuations of land and
dollar bills

  Truth is better than falsehood 

	So if you were housing a Jew in your home in Holand  and
the SS troopers asks if you are housing a Jew is it objectively better to
tell the truth  I am holding a Jew  than a falsehood  No I am not
holding a Jew

	In this case let us assume that if you lie the SS trooper leaves
never to bother you Either way nothing is ever done to you no prison 
trouble etc

	Of course if you tell the truth then the Jew will be executed

	Is it better to tell the truth or lie

Good question my point was that a world with truth is better than a world
with falsehood  A world in which it were possible to say yes I am
holding a Jew the truth and you me the Jew and the SS guy all sit
down to crack open a bottle of whiskey is better than the grim alternatives 
you present Obviously this is not possible and the best alternative seems
to be to lie  That's because other values are involved such as life
Now that IS just my opinion  don't confuse the claim 'objective morality
exists' with the claim 'I have a lock on morals'

NB sir I could have responded with 'according to you truth does
not exist therefore it is impossible to tell it  What is true for
you may not be true for me'

  I forget the origin of the quote but I gotta use words when I talk to
  you  An atheist is one who lacks belief in gods yes  If so then
  it's entirely plausible that an atheist could dig Lenin or Lennon to
  such an extent that it might be considered worship and still be
  an atheist  Anything else seems to be Newspeak
 
 Ask yourself the following question   Would you regard an ardent
 Nazi as a republican simply because Germany no longer had a Kaiser
 
 No because that's based on false dichotomy   There are more options
 than you present me  

And that of course is the point   You can't simply divide the
world into atheists and nonatheists on the basis of godbelief

If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity and
have nothing to say about behaviour then belief in a supernatural
being is your criterion

But once you start talking about behaviour then someone's suscept
ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you 
are  I assume  worried about

And in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical
critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable and
easily led on the other

I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates
that a person is easily led   Whether they have a worship or belief 
in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be
beside the point

I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective
basis for the notion that science is useful worthy or important in
dealing with observed facts  Alternatively you could try to
demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful worthy
or important in any situation   In other words I need to know
how you use the term objective

	One need not have have the notion that science is useful For 
example many Christian scientists do not believe medical science to be 
usefor or worthy That does not make medical science subjective

	In any event I fail to see what you mean by subjective science
Are you suggesting that it is and that if I step of a building I may fall 
while you may not

	I assure you it is a very objective conclusion that you will fall 
 without any other outside means of support  If you do not believe this 
I suggest you step off of a building and subjectively believe that you will 
not fall

  At any rate even if your interpretation is correct this does 
  not imply that the killings are religously motivated which was 
  the original poster's seeming claim
 
 Tricky tricky   I'm replying to your blanket claim that they
 are not religiously motivated
 
 They aren't  Irish catholics in the south do not kill Irish protestants
 in the south yet have precisely the same history behind them  Those
 who think the killings are religously motivated ignore the rather
 obvious matter of British occupation partition and misguided patriotism
 on both sides 

False dichotomy  You claimed the killing were not religiously
motivated and I'm saying that's wrong   I'm not saying that
each and every killing is religiously motivate as I spelled out
in detail


 
 The problems fault along the religious divide because at the historical
 roots of this thing we have a catholic country partitioned and populated
 by a protestant one   The grotesque killing of soldiers and 
 civilians is supposedly motivated by patriotism civil rights issues and 
 revenge  It's only difficult to understand insofaras insanity is hard 
 to understand  religion need not be invoked to explain it  

Does anyone else see the contradiction in this paragraph


 But to claim that The killings in NI are not religously 
 motivated is grotesque   All that means is that the Church
 and believers are doing what they always do with history
 they can't face they rewrite it
 
 You're attacking a different claim  My claim is that when an IRA
 terrorist plants a bomb in Warrington she does not have as a motive 
 the greater glory of God 

Sorry Frank but what I put in quotes is your own words from your
posting qibechorusapmchpsnide  Don't tell us now that 
it's a different claim   If you can no longer stand behind your 
original claim just say so

right

The FlatEarthers state that the Earth is flat is a fact I don't accept
this I think it's an unproven opinion and I think the RoundEarthers are
right because they have better evidence than the FlatEarthers do

Although I can't prove that a god doesn't exist the arguments used to
support a god's existence are weak and often selfcontradictory and I'm not
going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a
reason to believe in a god that I absolutely can't ignore

A while ago I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken
in which he proved some of the wildest things and on the last page he
wrote something like Can you prove it isn't so I certainly can't but
I'm not going to believe him because he based his proof on some really
questionable stuff such as old myths he called it circumstancial
evidence

    gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money
    for food A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked
    his wife with a kitchen knife cutting her throat police said
 
    She was only the latest of  women slain by a husband or
    lover in Quebec in the last five weeks
 
    Five children have also been slain as a result of the same
    domestic battles
 
    Last year in Quebec alone  women were slain by their
    husbands That was more than onethird of such cases across
    Canada according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for
    Justice rest of article ommited
 
Then to say that women are somehow better or should be the
one to stay home and raise a child is also laughable Women
have traditionally done hard labor to support a family often 
more than men in many cultures throughout history Seems to me
it takes at least two adults to raise a child and that BOTH should
stay home to do so

There's a way around that via the hadith which state that silence is
taken to mean yes and that women may not speak before a judge who
must conduct the marriage
 
 Actaully that's a false hadith because it contradicts verses in the
 Quran that says women may testify speak before a judge
 
 Hadiths are declared false when they contradict the Quran  Hadiths
 weren't written during the revelation or during the life of the prophet
 and so may contain errors

So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is
if it contradicts the Quran  What if it relates to something
that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran

Also the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed
either  It wasn't long after but  years or so is still long
enough to shift a few verses around

Eric you bring up a point that I hadn't heard before and would like
explanation on  Did I understand you correctly when you said that
the idea that Christianity has an objective morality is absurd I read
it as saying that Christians don't claim any sense of abolute morality

I believe that the idea of objective morality is absurd becasuse all
the evidence I've seen indicates that morality and moral systems are
man made and thus subjective

This is not a shot at Christianity I would apply it to any other person
or group that advocates objective morality unless said persongroup
can provide some sort of evidence to support that claim

Actually Christians do claim an absolute morality but that is another
matter

I always heard it said that Christians claim a moral system but there is
no reason to follow it rather than any other  Is this more in line with 
what you meant

No not really

 I'm one of those people who does not know what the word objective means

 Give it a try
 
 Objective morality is morality built from objective values

      And these objective values are  
Please be specific and more importantly motivate

I'll take a wild guess and say Freedom is objectively valuable  I base
this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly
of their freedom so that their every act was contrary to their volition
almost all would want to complain  Therefore I take it that to assert or
believe that Freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see
that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on
a rainy day  I take this to be a candidate for an objective value and it
it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values
such as this exist

I just borrowed a book from the library on Khomeini's fatwa etc

I found this useful passage regarding the legitimacy of the fatwa

It was also common knowledge as prescribed by Islamic law that the
sentence was only applicable where the jurisdiction of Islamic law
applies  Moreover the sentence has to be passed by an Islamic court
and executed by the state machinery through the due process of the law
Even in Islamic countries let alone in nonMuslim lands individuals
cannot take the law into their own hands  The sentence when passed
must be carried out by the state through the usual machinery and not by
individuals  Indeed it becomes a criminal act to take the law into
one's own hands and punish the offender unless it is in the process of
selfdefence  Moreover the offender must be brought to the notice of
the court and it is the court who shoud decide how to deal with him
This law applies equally to Muslim as well as nonMuslim territories


I agree fully with the above statement and is precisely what I meant
by my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the
law not being enforcible despite the law being applicable 


Hence on such clarification from the ulama Islamic scholars Muslims
in Britain before and after Imam Khomeini's fatwa made it very clear
that since Islamic law is not applicable to Britain the hadd
compulsory punishment cannot be applied here


I disagree with this conclusion about the applicability of the 
Islamic law to all muslims wherever they may be The above conclusion 
does not strictly follow from the foregoing but only the conclusion 
that the fatwa cannot be enforced according to Islamic law However 
I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even were
it well founded

Wow from the above it looks like that from an Islamic viewpoint
Khomeini's fatwa constitutes a criminal act  perhaps I could
even go out on a limb and call Khomeini a criminal on this basis


Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal 
act according to Islamic law 


Anyhow I think it is understood by knowledgeable Muslims that
Khomeini's fatwa is Islamically illegitimate at least on the basis
expounded above  Others such as myself and others who have posted here
particularly Umar Khan and Gregg Jaeger I think go further and say
that even the punishment constituted in the fatwa is against Islamic law
according to our understanding

Yes

 It is my understanding that it is generally agreed upon by the ulema
 Islamic scholars that Islamic law applies only in an Islamic country
 of which the UK is not  Furthermore to take the law into one's own
 hands is a criminal act as these are matters for the state not for
 individuals  Nevertheless Khomeini offered a cash prize for people to
 take the law into their own hands  something which to my
 understanding is against Islamic law

Yes this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws
However I believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all
five schools of law  sunni and  jaffari can be levelled against
muslim or nonmuslims both within and outside daralislam I do
not know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and
open hostility to Islam falls into this category of the law I do know
that
historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone
by the death penalty

My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the
law of apostasy alone It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate
long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no
precedent in the Qur'an hadith or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly
levelling death penalties for apostasy

I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of fasad This
ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an
Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals The reward was
not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran


 Stuff deleted
 Also I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that
 Khomeini's fatwa was issued due to the distribution of the book  My
 understanding is that Khomeini's fatwa was issued in response to the
 writing and publishing of the book  If my view is correct then
 your viewpoint that Rushdie was sentenced for a crime in progress is
 incorrect
 
I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what I remember was
levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication
of the book However the charge of fasad can encompass a
number of lesser charges I remember that when diplomatic relations
broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa  Iran stressed that
the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from
circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the
crisis But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not
the main thrust behind the fatwa Islamic charges such as fasad are
levelled at people not books

The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the
issuance of the fatwa Rushdie went on a media blitz
presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of
secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people
crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred 
Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost
his image and push the book he was everywhere in the media Then
Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while
protesting against the book Rushdie appeared momentarily
concerned then climbed back on his media horse to once again
attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights It was at this
point that the fatwa on fasad was issued

The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie  any actions of
Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of
the ruling The book remains in circulation not by some independant
will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers The fatwa
against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well The
crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being
played out and played up in the the full view of the media

PS I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of shatim also
applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella
of the fasad ruling

 What about the Twelve Imams who he considered incapable of error
 or sin Khomeini supports this view of the Twelve Imans This is
 heresy for the very reasons I gave above 

I would be happy to discuss the  issue of the  Imams with you although
my preference would be to move the discussion to another
newsgroup  I feel a philosophy
or religion group would be more appropriate The topic is deeply
embedded in the world view of Islam and the
esoteric teachings of the Prophet SA Heresy does not enter
into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric
religion that is only nominally if at all concerned with the metaphysical
substance of man's being and nature

A good introductory book in fact one of the best introductory
books to Islam in general is Murtaza Mutahhari's Fundamental's
of Islamic Thought  God Man and the Universe  Mizan Press
translated by R Campbell Truly a beautiful book A followup book
if you can find a decent translation is Wilaya  The Station
of the Master by the same author I think it also goes under the
title of Master and Mastership  It's a very small book  really
just a transcription of a lecture by the author
The introduction to the beautiful Psalms of Islam  translated
by William C Chittick available through Muhammadi Trust of
Great Britain is also an excellent introduction to the subject We
have these books in our University library  I imagine any well
stocked University library will have them

From your posts you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought You
should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable 
Shi'ite authors as well  at least that much respect is due before the
charge of heresy is levelled

 To the newsgroup at large how about this for a deal recognise that what 
 happened in former Communist Russia has as much bearing on the validity 
 of atheism as has the doings of sundry theists on the validity of their 
 theism  That's zip nada none  The fallacy is known as ad hominem and 
 it's an old one It should be in the Holy FAQ in the Book of Constructing
 a Logical Argument 

Apart from not making a lot of sense this is wrong   There
is no atheist creed that taught any communist what to do in
the name of atheism   There clearly are theistic creeds and
instructions on how to act for theists    They all madly
conflict with one another but that's another issue

Lack of instructions on how to act might also be evil

That's like saying that since mathematics includes no instructions on
how to act it is evil  Atheism is not a moral system so why should
it speak of instructions on how to act  Atheism is simply lack of
belief in God

  Plenty of theists
think so   So one could argue the case for atheism causes whatever
I didn't like about the former USSR with as much validity as theism
causes genocide  that is to say no validity at all

I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide
can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide
This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act
and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide  However since
the atheist set of instructions is the null set how can you show that
atheism causes genocide

It appears that Walla Walla College will fill the same role in altatheist
that Allegheny College fills in altfandanquayle

	First I want to start right out and say that I'm a Christian  It 
makes sense to be one  Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book liar 
lunatic or the real thing  I might be a little off on the title but he 
writes the book  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity 
in the process he became a Christian himself

Converts to xtianity have this tendency to excessively darken their
prextian past frequently falsely  Anyone who embarks on an
effort to destroy xtianity is suffering from deep megalomania a
defect which is not cured by religious conversion

	The arguements he uses I am summing up  The book is about whether 
Jesus was God or not  I know many of you don't believe but listen to a 
different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what 
others have to say  

Different perspective  DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

	The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a 
modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he was

sigh  Perhaps Big J was just mistaken about some of his claims
Perhaps he was normally insightful but had a few off days  Perhaps
many most of the statements attributed to Jesus were not made by
him but were put into his mouth by later authors  Other possibilities
abound  Surely someone seriously examining this question could
come up with a decent list of possible alternatives unless the task
is not serious examination of the question much less destroying
xtianity but rather religious salesmanship

	Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows  Who would 
die for a lie

How many Germans died for Nazism  How many Russians died in the name
of the proletarian dictatorship  How many Americans died to make the
world safe for democracy  What a silly question

Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar  People 
gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing 
someone who was or had been healed  Call me a fool but I believe he did 
heal people  

Is everyone who performs a healing  God

	Niether was he a lunatic  Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
to someone who was crazy

It's probably hard to draw an entire nation to you unless you 
are crazy

Very doubtful in fact rediculous  For example 
anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see 
this right away
	Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the 
real thing  

Anyone who is convinced by this laughable logic deserves
to be a xtian

	Some other things to note  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in 
the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone  This in his betrayal 
and Crucifixion  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I 
write I will use it

Don't bother  Many of the prophecies were fulfilled only in the
eyes of xtian apologists who distort the meaning of Isaiah and
other OT books

I really don't think you can imagine what it is like to be infinite

First of all infinity is a mathematical concept created by humans
to explain certain things in a certain way We don't know if it actually
applies to reality we don't know if anything in the world is infinite

It wouldn't be able to
comprehend what reality is like for the programmer because that would
require an infinite memory or whatever because reality is continuous and
based on infinietely small units no units

You don't know if the universe is actually continuous Continuum is another
mathematical concept based on infinity used to explain things in a certain
way

Because humans do not know what infinite is  We call it something
beyond numbers  We call it endless but we do not know what it is

I have a pretty good idea of what infinity is It's a manmade concept and
like many manmade concepts it has evolved through time Ancient Greeks had
a different understanding of it

So we can call Allah infinitely powerful knowledgeable etc yet we
cannot imagine what Allah actually is because we just cannot imagine
what it is like to be infinite

Precicely We don't even know if infinity applies to reality

 You claimed that people that took the time to translate the bible would
 also take the time to get it right  But here in less than a couple
 generations you've been given ample proof agreed to by yourself above
 that the new versions tends to be out of step with other modern
 translations
 
 What I said was that people took time to copy the text correctly
 Translations present completely different issues

So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had different
versions of some OT texts   Did I misunderstand

 Good question my point was that a world with truth is better than a world
 with falsehood  A world in which it were possible to say yes I am
 holding a Jew the truth and you me the Jew and the SS guy all sit
 down to crack open a bottle of whiskey is better than the grim alternatives 
 you present Obviously this is not possible and the best alternative seems
 to be to lie  That's because other values are involved such as life
 Now that IS just my opinion  don't confuse the claim 'objective morality
 exists' with the claim 'I have a lock on morals'

I think that at this point it would actually be quite easy to
confuse objective morality with relative morality

 What we should be demanding is for Khomeini and his ilk to publicly
 come clean and to show their proof that Islamic Law punishes
 apostacy with death or that it tolerates any similar form of
 coversion of freedom of conscience

All five schools of law to the best of my knowledge support the
death sentence for apostasy WHEN it is accompanied by open persistent
and aggravated hostility to Islam Otherwise
I agree there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief
The Qur'an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience Public
or private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is not
punishable there are some jurists who have gone against this
trend and insisted that apostasy is punishable even by death  but
historically they are the exception

Cursing and Insulting the Prophets falls under the category of Shatim

 
 I just borrowed a book from the library on Khomeini's fatwa etc
Lots of stuff deleted
 
 And according to the above analysis it looks like Khomeini's offering
 of a reward for Rushdie's death in fact constitutes a criminal act
 according to Islamic law

 I'll take a wild guess and say Freedom is objectively valuable  I base
 this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly
 of their freedom so that their every act was contrary to their volition
 almost all would want to complain  Therefore I take it that to assert or
 believe that Freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see
 that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on
 a rainy day  I take this to be a candidate for an objective value and it
 it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values
 such as this exist

My own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom
is a good thing

However when I here people assert that the only true freedom
is in following the words of this and that Messiah I realise
that people don't even agree on the meaning of the word

What does it mean to say that word X represents an objective
value when word X has no objective meaning

 	First I want to start right out and say that I'm a Christian  It 

That's okay  it's what all the rest of them who come on here say

 makes sense to be one  Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book liar 
 lunatic or the real thing  I might be a little off on the title but he 
 writes the book  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity 
 in the process he became a Christian himself

This isn't the guy who was a lawyer was he  Could you give more info on this
guy never mind I'm sure there will be PLENTY of responses to this post and
it will appear there

 	The arguements he uses I am summing up  The book is about whether 
 Jesus was God or not  I know many of you don't believe but listen to a 
 different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what 
 others have to say

This is true  Make sure it is true for ALL cases
  
 	The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a

Why not both  
 
 modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he was
 	Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows  Who would 
 die for a lie  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar  

Why not die for a lie  If you were poverty stricken and alunatic sounds
perfecetly reasoable to me  As to whether the societal dregs he had for
followers would be able to tell if he was a liar or not not necessarily
Even if he died for what he believed in this still makes him completely
selfish  Like us all  So what's the difference


People 
 gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing 
 someone who was or had been healed  Call me a fool but I believe he did 
 heal people  

There is no historical proof of this see earlier threads  Besides he or at
least his name have been the cause of enough deaths to make up for whatever
healing he gave


 	Niether was he a lunatic  Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
 to someone who was crazy  

SIEG HEIL


Very doubtful in fact rediculous  For example 
 anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see 
 this right away


Who is David Koresh  I am curious

 	Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the 
 real thing  

How does this follow  Your definition of lunatic and disproof thereof seem
rather uhhh SHAKY

 	Some other things to note  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in 
 the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone  This in his betrayal 
 and Crucifixion  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I 
 write I will use it

Good idea

 	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is  It 
 is certainly not what I see a lot in churches 

Naturally those or not TRUE Christians right  

 Rather I think it 
 should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's 
 sake  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the 
 same  Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives 
 over to him  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it to be a 
 real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at  But 
 just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes 
 time  We don't rush it in one day Christianity is your whole life  
 It is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in 
 a while  We box everything into time units  Such as work at this 
 time sports Tv social life  God is above these boxes and should be 
 carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for 
 ourselves  	  


Someone else handle this I don't know if it's worth it sigh

   Christianity is an infectious cult  The reasons it flourishes are 
   because  it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life
   a safety blanked to hide behind  Oh wowall i have to do is 
   follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness
  
  I agree that in many cases primitive emotional feelings based on
  'haha you won't laugh in hell' mentalities makes certain religions
  very attractive for certain personalities
 
 I agree with both of u but I would like to make a small point  Xtianity 
 other dogmatic religions not only attract people without hope etc but
 also attract average people as well  I believe that Xtainity thru
 its escapist doctrines  absolutist attitudes provides great psychological 
 shelter from daytoday frustrations unhappiness  fear of uncertainty 
  unknown etc


This is a good point but I think average people do not take up Christianity
so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their
social life or to get more involved with American culture if they are kids of
immigrants for example  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the
Western World in some form or other it is simply the choice people take if
they are bored and want to do something new with their lives but not somethong
TOO new or TOO out of the ordinary  Seems a little weak but as long as it
doesn't hurt anybody
 
 The Buddha had something to say about the attractiveness of religions
 
    When driven by fear man worships sacred mountains sacred stones 
 	and sacred trees 
 
 However the Buddha also said
 
 	If somebody finds peace in any religion let him be
 
 

These are good quotes and I agree with both of them but let's make sure to
alter the scond one so that includes something like let him be as long as
he is not preventing others from finding their peace or something like that 
Of course I suppose if someone were REALLY at peace there would be no
need for inflicting evangelism


 Personally I feel that since religion have such a poweful
 psychological effect we should let theists be  But the problem is that
 religions cause enormous harm to nonbelievers and to humanity as a whole
 holy wars inquisitions interreligious hatred impedence of science
  intellectual progress usthem attitudes etc etc  Need I say more
 I really don't know what we can do about them  Any comments
 
Well it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives  Their
popularity seems to come and go  I remember when I first entered High School
I was an atheist always had been and so were about  of my friends  At this
time  of those  have converted always to Christianity they were all also
immigrants from Taiwan or sons of immigrants hence my earlier gross
generalization  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it
ever has before since I've been noticing  Maybe it is just my perceptions
that are chagning  Who knows
I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them so long as we
have some set of abstract rightsagreements on how we should treat each other
I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions  For all the wellput
arguments on this usenet it never does any good  Argumentation does not
really seem to apply to Christians or even some atheists it must simply be a
step the person takes naturally almost instinctively

As I recall the figure for just one of the molecules forming is   

If amino acids were somehow formed in an organic soup they must get out of 
it if they are to form larger molecules and evolve toward becoming proteins
useful for the formation of life  But once they get out of the water they 
are in the destructive ultraviolet light  By the same token bodies of water
are not conducive to the necessary chemistry  It is hard to see how
polymerisation sp could have proceeded in the primitive soup since
the presence
of water favors depolymerisation   

What is your degree in again  or should I say when  This is a 's
view of abiogenesis  PLease read something modern like Carle Woose's
On the Origins which he beats these warm little ponds into the ground

Look at archeobacteria  they live in areas so hot you would melt  
                        
And believe it or not we use their machinery everday in the pursuit of
new drugs therapies and knowledge

There are many other stubborn problems  The  amino acids needed for 
life's proteins are all left handed  If they formed randomly as the theory 
states what are the chances that all the one's needed for life's proteins

You mean your theory  Again arguing this point is like telling a child
that the sky will not fall  If the child is stubborn you will not get anywhere

would be left handed  

The P  They are left handed   Really this is not a big deal  There are
many problems with abiogenisis but these are really trivial

Jack
Please Jack rad some modern biololgy  i do not mean books by creationists
about modern biology  Pick up a text book and read  I think you
would like Woose's On the Origins  He is an arogant man but his writting
and research is brilliant

I think that you are confusing the words objective and inherent
And objective system is simply one in which an outside observer who
given the postulates of the system could perfectly judge any situation
or action as consistent with the system right or not wrong  You seem
to be objecting because the goals of the system are not inherent  That is
you seem to want to define an objective system as one in which the
postulates themselves could be determined by some outside observer
I don't think that this is a good definition of an objective system
Then you need to learn English

Really

Gravity is an objective system  Anybody can learn what it is and perform
experiments  They will get the same results as every other person who
has performed those experiments

No gravity is an inherent system  You don't need any excess information
other than observations to determine anything  It is possible to objectively
determine someone's guilt or innocence within an noninherent system
I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent unless you state that
everything we do has an evolutionary basis but this does not mean that
it cannot be objective in theory

This natural morality is not an objective system as evidenced by
your comments about lions and mine

Perhaps it can be objective but not inherent  Anyway as I noted before
the practices related to mating rituals etc among the animals are likely
the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions
of the natural law  Therefore some revisions are in order since the
class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems

And in fact the only way that the postulates could be determined by an
outsider would be if there were some sort of higher truth like some
sort of god or something  But I do not think that a god is necessary
for an objective system while it seems that you do
What are you trying to say here

It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system
because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence which would
necessitate some sort of grand design

No I have classified behavior of most animals as in line with a
moral system  It is certainly possible for animals to commit acts
which are outside of their rules of ethics but they don't seem to
do so very often  Perhaps they are not intelligent enough to be
immoral
And perhaps it's because you have yet to define a moral system

I think I have  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired
behaviors etc  An immoral behavior could be unwanted unproductive
or destructive etc depending on the goal of the system that is
immoral to what end

a long time in the wild  Yes it's possible but it is difficult  Humans
are a social animal and that is a cause of our success

and in order for a group to function effectively it
needs some sort of ethical code
This statement is not correct

Isn't it  Why don't you think so

And by pointing out that a species' conduct serves to propogate itself
I am not trying to give you your tautology but I am trying to show that
such are examples of moral systems with a goal  Propogation of the species
is a goal of a natural system of morality
So anybody who lives in a monagamous relationship is not moral  After all
in order to ensure propogation of the species every man should impregnate
as many women as possible

No  As noted earlier lack of mating such as abstinence or homosexuality
isn't really destructive to the system  It is a worst neutral

For that matter in herds of horses only the dominate stallion mates  When
he diesis killedwhatever the new dominate stallion is the only one who
mates  These seems to be a case of your natural system of morality trying
to shoot itself in the figurative foot

Again the mating practices are something to be reexamined

So how do you then explain sudden violent behavior of human beings
Your theory would state that the more the human is detached from 
primitive behavior the more violent and nonmoralistic the human
becomes please correct me if my understanding was wrong So
you have this bifurcation point where a madman is killing people
from the roof of a campus Could you explain how your 'theory'
explains such a situation

Madmen are mad  Do we try to explain the output from a broken computer
I think not

To show that the examples I and others
have provided are not counter examples of your supposed inherent
moral hypothesis you have to successfully argue that
domestication removes or alters this morality

I think that domestication will change behavior to a large degree
Domesticated animals exhibit behaviors not found in the wild  I
don't think that they can be viewed as good representatives of the
wild animal kingdom since they have been bred for thousands of years
to produce certain behaviors etc

Well I have typed in the OED definitions  As you will note upon reading

Sorry you must have missed the stuff in parens when you read the
definition where transf  transferred sense and fig

      Is that you Mike Cobb or is someone else using a MAC sig
      And why on earth was this crossposted to talkabortion

 My definition of objective would be absolute or fixed rather than
   subjective or varying and changing

      Inotherwords any moral system that is still what we're talking
about right can be 'objective' provided you stick to it no matter
what Doesn't sound good to me stifles progress



Yup  This is me  I don't know why it crossposted  I was accessing nn 
from another system and that might have caused the glitch

I hold that an objective moral system exists regardless of my knowledge or 
application of it  I relate it to the idea that there is scientific truth 
that is truth even though I may not know about it  

Some morals I wouldn't want to change and would not consider it progress 
for
a society to oneday say that rape and murder are ok  Some underlying 
themes morality honesty courage respect etc are used to base 
actions  I don't consider the idea that we should have been moral should 
be moral now and should be so in the future a limitation when it includes 
such morality  Aberrances in a moral system ie it is immoral to marry
someone of the opposite sex it is immoral to listen to rock and roll etc 
seem to be different than the above lists and if specific actions are given
moral status I tend to question those morals

If I can predict with almost  accuracy that Americans prefer to own their 
portions of the US than an infinitesmal portion of  in what sense are 
these values not objective  

Ahhhh  I see what you mean now

But in this example it is not the values that are objective but
the existence of those values  At least they are as objectively real
as anything is

I don't think I'm way off beam in saying that something is
better than nothing is a rational and objective valuation 

The term 'rational' does not apply to a simple statement like that
You would have to include the statement within a syllogism and
assert the rationility of the syllogism

A statement is just a statement  

As to its objectivity  well it depends what you mean

Values tend to be regarded as good or bad valid or invalid true or false
and so on  Objective values are those which must fall into one or other of
those options for all people  or if you are prepared for dissent then
they are those values which should be accepted by everyone
If someone rejects an objective value they are regarded as 'wrong'

Objective values require a fundamental notion of good versus bad or at
least right versus wrong or even just correct versus incorrect and
a way of relating that to specific aspects of human behaviour
In my opinion that requires a belief in a deity of some sort

Suppose you could predict with almost  accuracy that Americans
believed that something is better than nothing
You could usefully say that the existence of that value was an
objective fact  You could not say that the value itself was
objective   You could not do that unless you could prove that the
value was 'right'  Showing that everyone happens to accept the value
as right doesn't show that it is right

Do you agree with me then that the assertion no values are objective 
is false

Well I am a believer in a God  So I do believe that some values are
objective  But I usually suspend that belief when posting to ta
because it immediately invalidates subsequent arguments in the mind
of many ta readers

So ignoring the idea of a God I disagree with you
I believe in this limited context that 'no values are objective'

But I think that this thread is showing some crosspurpose debate
I think I understand your use of the word 'objective' when
relating it to values  I think it is an unusual usage but I
believe you are consistent given that usage

Ten Commandments

Sayings of Jesus

the first depends on whether you trust the Bible 

the second depends on both whether you think Jesus is God and whether
  you think we have accurate copies of the NT

 OK so pick former Yugoslavia instead and say their problems are caused
 by communism it doesn't really matter  But I guess religious leaders are
 calling for an end to that too so it can't be religiously motivated  This
 despite the fact that the Christians carve crosses in dead Muslims chests
 Maybe they just want land  Maybe its something else they want  Maybe the
 cross carvings are just accidental  I don't know  Just looks suspicious

Most likely the tragic situation in Bosnia is a combination of ethnical
and religious motives where religion is just one attribute that separates
the groups from each other

But I must agree that the sad saga in Bosnia is a terrible example
of a case where religion is not helping instead it is used as a weapon
against other humans And my sympathies are mostly on the Bosnian side
it looks like the Serbs are the oppressors willing to use even
Christianity as a weapon against their former friends

  However I have read a book
  
    GA Wells DidJesusExist
  
    ISBN 
  
  I found it to be thorough and interesting but perhaps not the end of the
  story
  
  Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating 
  to questions of science
 
      There is a great fallacy in your statement The question of origins is
      based on more than science alone  If you met a man who could walk on
      water raise people from the dead claimed to be the Son of God and
      then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures this would affect
      your belief in the origin of man  I can expand on this  Science and
      the Bible are not in contradiction  God can supercede the scientific
      laws as man understands them  Creation is a good example  God has the
      power to create something out of nothing order out of chaos
      If the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the 
      substance of the book it must be a real laugher  Of course Jesus existed
      and there are volumes of evidence to back it up  I can give many if you
      are interested
 	If I were to experience this strange creature for myself perhaps
 
 	However one highly biased account as well as possibly internally 
 inconsistent written over  mellenia ago in a dead language by fanatic
 devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more 
 objective sources and isnt  even accepted by those who's messiah this creature 
 was supposed to be doesn't convince me in the slightest especially when many
 of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of 
 guano

       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you don't want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts

  The death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime  but the legal
  shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court
  battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what
  it should be  Hence the question is  do we instate the death penalty as
  it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of
  it entirely

  I doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a deterrent to crime If so
why doesn't every crime carry a death penalty  That would be effictive
wouldn't it 

  The death penalty is a punishment much like a  fine for speeding is
a punishment Anyway somebody with murder on the mind doesn't much care
about the consequences I think another problem is that people dont think
they will get caught If I wanted to kill another person I wouldn't 
care what the penalty was if I didn't think I would get caught

  If it was to be strictly a deterrent it should have been more along 
the lines of torture

 Personally I feel that since religion have such a poweful
 psychological effect we should let theists be  But the problem is that
 religions cause enormous harm to nonbelievers and to humanity as a whole
 holy wars inquisitions interreligious hatred impedence of science
  intellectual progress usthem attitudes etc etc  Need I say more
 I really don't know what we can do about them  Any comments
 

  I have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons
attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax
anybody else This seems to be ok for atheists You don't get an atheist
knocking on your door stopping you in the airport or handing out
literature at a social event Theists seem to think that thier form of
happy should work for others and try to make it so 

  My sister is a 
born again and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family
for several years She finally got the clue that she couldn't help
During that period she bought me I was atheist now I'm Xtian books
for my birthday and Xmas several times Our birthday cards would contain
verses It was a problem I told my mom that I was going to send my
sister an atheist piece of reading material I got a Don't you dare
My mom wasn't religious Why did she insist that I not send it 

   Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to
preach nonreligion should be self contained What a crock of shit
I finally told my sister that I didn't find her way of life attractive
I have seen exactly  effort from her on trying to convert me since then

   I'm sick of religious types being pampered looked out for and WORST
OF ALL     respected more than atheists There must be an end
in sight

Subject Why the bible
Lines 

      One thing I think is interesting about altathiesm is the fact that
without biblethumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup
It almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to
tear apart Oh well that little tidbit aside here is what I really wanted
write about

      How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible If you
want to be religious aren't there more plausable books out there Seriously
the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each
other One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next
it says not to kill at all I think that if xtians really want to follow a
deity they should pick one that can be consistent unlike the last one they
invented

      For people who say Jesus was the son of god didn't god say not to
EVER put ANYONE else before him Looks like you did just that Didn't god
say not to make any symbols or idols What are crosses then Don't you think
that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track

Was Jesus illiterate Why didn't he write anything Anyone know

      I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that
it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the
poorer quality ones to boot The only reason xtianity escaped the middle east
is because a certain roman who's wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome
xtian after a bad dream

      If this posting keeps one person just ONE person from standing on a
streetcorner and telling people they are going to hell I will be happy

How many contridictions do you want to see
Good question If I claim something is a general trend then to disprove this
I guess you'd have to show that it was not a general trend
No if you're going to claim something then it is up to you to prove it
Think Cold Fusion

Well I've provided examples to show that the trend was general and you
or others have provided some counterexamples mostly ones surrounding
mating practices etc  I don't think that these few cases are enough to
disprove the general trend of natural morality  And again the mating
practices need to be reexamined

Try to find immoral nonmatingrelated activities
So you're excluding matingrelatedactivities from your natural morality

No but mating practices are a special case  I'll have to think about it
some more

Yes I think that the natural system can be objectively deduced with the
goal of species propogation in mind  But I am not equating the two
as you so think  That is an objective system isn't necessarily the
natural one
Are you or are you not the man who wrote
A natural moral system is the objective moral system that most animals
 follow

Indeed  But while the natural system is objective all objective systems
are not the natural one  So the terms can not be equated  The natural
system is a subset of the objective ones

Now since homosexuality has been observed in most animals including
birds and dolphins are you going to claim that most animals have
the capacity of being immoral

I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral  It isn't harmful although
it isn't helpful either to the mating process  And when you say that
homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom don't you mean bisexuality

Because we can't determine to what end we should be moral
Are you claiming to be a group  We usually implies more than one entity

This is standard jargon  Read any textbook  The we forms are used
throughout

Well I'm saying that these goals are not inherent  That is why they must
be postulates because there is not really a way to determine them
otherwise although it could be argued that they arise from the natural
goalbut they are somewhat removed
Postulate To assume posit

That's right  The goals themselves aren't inherent

I can create a theory with a postulate that the Sun revolves around the
Earth that the moon is actually made of green cheese and the stars are
the portions of Angels that intrudes into threedimensional reality

You could but such would contradict observations

I can build a mathematical proof with a postulate that given the length
of one side of a triangle the length of a second side of the triangle and
the degree of angle connecting them I can determine the length of the
third side

But a postulate is something that is generally or always found to be
true  I don't think your postulate would be valid

Guess which one people are going to be more receptive to  In order to assume
something about your system you have to be able to show that your postulates
work

Yes and I think the goals of survival and happiness do work  You think
they don't  Or are they not good goals

Judaism for one Maddi has confirmed this for one And again I
reiterate that one can easily leave the religion at any time
simply by making a public declaration If one is too lazy to do
that then the religion cannot be held responsible

There are many Islamic countries where publically renouncing Islam can be
quite dangerous  These countries might not according to you necessarily be
practicing true Islam but the danger still remains one cannot blame
failure to publically renounce Islam on laziness as opposed to a desire to
stay alive and well

Of course if you're planning to pull a Rushdie then declaring one's
leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to one's
other plans


In Rushdie's case the one under discussion one can It is tragic that
in some Islamic countries this is so There are however Islamic
countries whose constitutions contains statements that Islamic law is
to be incorporated eg Kuwait where one can freely make such
statements without fear


Not to mention that it has already been pointed out that Rushdie has said in
his books that he's not a Muslim and there have surely been enough readers of
his books to provide the appropriate number of witnesses

This story has become tiresome The conditions are clear If you care to
make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made
public statements about leaving Islam prior to his writing of TSV If
he did make such statements then he should have made that clear rather
than trying to rejoin Islam or go on talking about his personal
feelings

 Khomenei was a jerk and so were plenty of 
British leaders so what 

THE QUR'AN is the basis of judgement Khomenei was clearly a heretic
by the standards of the Qur'an End of story

Could you be a little more specific as to exactly why Khomanei was a
heretic and a jerk as judged by the Koran  I have no liking for the
guy but as far as I know he has done nothing contrary to the teachings
of the Koran or at least so I'm told by several Iranian research
students that I share an office with

It is easy and convenient for you to denounce him  But I have the 
feeling that your views are not as clear cut and widely accepted as you
suggest

I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again Khomeini put a 
price on the head of someone in another country this makes him a jerk
as well as an international outlaw Khomeini advocates the view that
there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders the Twelve Imams who
are free of error or sin This makes him a heretic In the Qur'an 
Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God the Qur'an says that
Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior thus
no muslim is free from error 


As usual there seems to be almost as many Islamic viewpoints as there
are Muslims  

Perhaps it seems so to you but this is hardly the case There is
widespread agreement about matters of Islam There certainly are
many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in
and of themselves but this is so for any large group of people
under the same name 

It all comes back to the Koran being so imprecise in its wording

The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording though it is true
that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of
many words However as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings
precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come
to agreement about them

Well it seemed slightly incongruous to find the Union Jack flying
at City Hall in Belfast 

May I ask why  It's there not because the British want it there NI
is just one big expensive problem it's there because that is
what the majority of the population of NI want  Is there some
problem with that

The majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps
There seems quite alot of incentive for the British to have control
of NI like using the North Channel and Irish Sea as a waste dump I was
appalled at the dumping I saw in the harbor in Belfast It is my
understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water 
it'd be quite a problem if NI got its independence from Britain and
then stopped accepting the waste Are you suggesting that British
industry isn't making profit off the situation as well

This is degenerating to 'Zumder logic  Of course governments are

Perhaps not in Christianity but in Islam the choice of religious

  Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating 
  to questions of science  
 
 it  Did Jesus exist by G A Wells
 
      There is a great fallacy in your statement The question of origins is
      based on more than science alone  
 
 Nope no fallacy  Yep science is best in determining how religions handle
 why and who

        The problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the
        supernatural in the question of origins  Is this is a fair premise
        I utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of
        truth
 
      If you met a man who could walk on
      water raise people from the dead claimed to be the Son of God and
      then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures this would affect
      your belief in the origin of man  I can expand on this  
 
 Nope wouldn't affect my knowledge not belief of origins of anatomically
 modern humans  If that man could show me something better I'd change even if 
 it was the biblical story in exact detail  But then I would ask Why in the
 world did your father endow us with intellect and reason and then proceed to
 fool us  I mean the bible says nothing about the humanlike creatures that we
 know exist

        Some of these socalled humanlike creatures were apes  Some were
        humans  Some were fancifully reconstructed from fragments

 
 I doubt any of us will meet a man like this  But Bill if your version of all
 this is absolutely correct I'm still no worried about my salvation  I'll
 probaby make it I don't steal murder covet etc and I like to help other
 people  All I did was use the reason and intellect your god provided 
 He or she  benevolent and loving  will understand my dilemma don't you
 think 
           Good deeds do not justify a person in God's sight
           An atonement Jesus is needed to atone for sin
 
      Science and
      the Bible are not in contradiction  God can supercede the scientific
      laws as man understands them  Creation is a good example  God has the
      power to create something out of nothing order out of chaos
 
 Haven't been on to long but I have a feeling Bill that the veterans will
 agree with you here  No contradiciton and god can do anything at will  So
 what's the beef or more properly where's

     My point God is the creator  Look's like we agree
 
 
     If the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the 
     substance of the book it must be a real laugher  Of course Jesus existed
     and there are volumes of evidence to back it up  I can give many if you
     are interested
 
 Its not a laugher Bill  Its a scholarly book that many happen to disagree
 with  I am definitely and seriously interested in confirmation  I know of
 the bible inferences therefrom eg prophecies apocrypha the Koran and
 others  What I am interested is independent evidence  Do you have any  I
 know of Josephus but this is almost certainly an insertion  Also I know of a
 few Roman documents eg Pliny but these deal only with early Christians
 Do you have any independent evidence  I am most interested  Please Email or 
 post  Thanks and best regards

     I'll send you some info via email

Mark how much do you REALLY know about vegetarian diets
The problem is not some Bvitamins it's balancing proteins  
There is also one vitamin that cannot be obtained from nonanimal
products and this is only of concern to VEGANS who eat no
meat dairy or eggs  I believe it is B and it is the only
problem  Supplements are available for vegans yes the B
does come from animal byproducts  If you are on an ovolacto
vegetarian diet eat dairy and eggs this is not an issue

I didn't see the original posting but
Yes I do know about vegetarian diets considering that several of my
close friends are devout vegetarians and have to take vitamin supplements
B was one of the ones I was thinking of it has been a long time since
I read the article I once saw talking about the special dietary needs
of vegetarians so I didn't quote full numbers  Considering how nice
this place is 

B can also come from wholegrain rice I understand  Some brands here
in Australia and other places too I'm sure get the B in the B
tablets from wholegrain rice

Are you sure those aren't an enriched type  I know it is basically
rice and soybeans to get almost everything you need but I hadn't heard
of any rice having B  

Just thought I'd contribute on a different issue from the norm 

You should have contributed to the programming thread earlier 

 Fred Rice
 dariceyoyoccmonasheduau   

M

If one is a vegan a vegetarian taht eats no animal products at at ie eggs 
milk cheese etc after about  years of a vegan diet you need to start 
taking B supplements because b is found only in animals Acutally our 
bodies make B I think but our bodies use up our own B after  or  
years  
Lactooveo vegetarians like myself still get B through milk products 
and eggs so we don't need supplements
And If anyone knows more PLEASE post it  I'm nearly contridicting myself 
with the mishmash of knowledge I've gleaned

So you are saying that it isn't possible for an instinctive act
to be moral one  That is in order for an act to be an act of morality
the person must consider the immoral action but then disregard it
No I'm saying that in order for an act to be moral or immoral somebody
someonesomething must consider it to be so  That implies intelligence
not instinct

Who has to consider it  The being that does the action  I'm still
not sure I know what you are trying to say

So you are saying that it isn't possible for an instinctive act

I like to think that many things are possible   Explain to me
how instinctive acts can be moral acts and I am happy to listen

For example if it were instinctive not to murder

That is in order for an act to be an act of morality
the person must consider the immoral action but then disregard 
it
Weaker than that   There must be the possibility that the
organism  it's not just people we are talking about  can
consider alternatives

So only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other
beings mimics theirs  And how much emphasis do you place on intelligence
Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but they
don't  Are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because
most animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do

I don't expect the lion to know or not know anything of the kind
In fact I don't have any evidence that lions ever consider such 
issues
And that of course is why I don't think you can assign moral
significance to the instinctive behaviour of lions

What I've been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior
That is it doesn't take much work to be moral but it certainly does to
be immoral in some cases  Also I've said that morality is a remnant
of evolution  Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in
the animal kingdom

So you are basically saying that you think a moral is an undefinable
term and that moral systems don't exist  If we can't agree on a
definition of these terms then how can we hope to discuss them
No it's perfectly clear that I am saying that I know what a moral
is in my system but that I can't speak for other people

But this doesn't get us anywhere  Your particular beliefs are irrelevant
unless you can share them or discuss them

Well seeing as you are not muslim the sort of fatwa issued by Khomeini
would not be relevant to you I can understand your fear of persecution
and I share it even more than you being muslim however Rushdie's
behavior was not completely excusable

Why should a fatwa issued by Khomeini be relevant to anyone who
doesn't live in Iran

Issued by Khomeini it shouldn't be relevant to anyone But issued
by an honest and learned scholar of Islam it would be relevant to
any muslim as it would be contrary to Islamic law which all muslims
are required to respect

  Who is it that decides whether Rushdie's behavior is excusable 

Anyone sufficiently well versed in Islamic law and capable of reasoning
if you are talking about a weak sense of excuse It depends on what 
sense of excuse you have in mind


 And who cares if you think it is inexcusable

Only someone who thinks my opinion is important obviously
Obviously you don't care nor do I care that you don't care

 Ezekiel  says Your hart was filled with pride because of all your

 For those of you who are Bible scholars you knowthat the st  verses

 human prince  Verses  refer to the King of Tyre which is a term for 
 Satan

Tammy what's the rationale to connect the prince of Tyre with Satan
could you give us more rational bible cites thanks I'm afraid that
if this is not the case your thinking model falls apart like a house
of cards But let's see

Cheers

sandviknewtonapplecom ALink KSAND  Private activities on the net

At the time Ezekiel was written Israel was in apostacy again and if I'm not 
mistaken Tyre was about to make war on Israel  Like I said the Prince of 
Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre  He was a wicked man  By calling Satan 
the King of Tyre Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre

Don't think my interpretation is neccessarily the orthodox Christian one 
although most Christian Bible commentaries interpret the King of Tyre as 
being a reference to Satan I haven't read Ezekiel throughly in a long 
time

You also saidWhy did millions suffer for what Adam and Ee did  Seems a
pretty sick way of going about creating a universe

I'm gonna respond by giving a small theology lessonforgive me I used
to be a theology major
First of all I believe that this planet is involved in a cosmic struggle
the Great Controversy betweed Christ and Satan i borrowed a book title
God has to consider the interests of the entire universe when making
decisions
Deletion
 
An universe it has created By the way can you tell me why it is less
tyrannic to let one of one's own creatures do what it likes to others
By your definitions your god has created Satan with full knowledge what
would happen  including every choice of Satan
 
Can you explain us what Free Will is and how it goes along with omniscience
Didn't your god know everything that would happen even before it created the
world Why is it concerned about being a tyrant when noone would care if
everything was fine for them That the whole idea comes from the possibility
to abuse power something your god introduced according to your description
 
 
By the way are you sure that you have read the FAQ Especially the part
about preaching
   Benedikt

I don't feel that I'm preaching I'm just trying to answer people's 
questions and talking about my religion my beliefs
When it comes to what I post I don't do it with the intent of converting 
anyone  I don't expect for the atheists in this newsgroup to take what I 
say with a grain of salt if they so wish
I just state what I beleve they ask me how I believeit and why and we all 
go on 
If that's preaching then I'm soory and I'll get off the soapbox

Look I'm not the one that made those Nazi comparisons  Other people
compared what the religious people are doing now to Nazi Germany  They

about any of these little things strangely enough and grew to bigger
things  They said that the motto is but one of the little things 
You just contradicted yourself  The motto is one of those little things that
nobody has bothered mentiopning to you huh

The little' things above were in reference to Germany clearly  People
said that there were similar things in Germany but no one could name any
They said that these were things that everyone should know and that they
weren't going to waste their time repeating them  Sounds to me like no one
knew either  I looked in some books but to no avail

that is
going to pave the way for other intrusions  Of course if the motto
hasn't caused problems in its  year history then I doubt it is going to
It has caused problems  You just ignore every instance when someone
describes one to you

It has caused problems  Again no one has shown that things were better
before the motto or that they'd likely be better after  I don't think
the motto initiates any sort of harassment  Harassment will occur whether
or not the motto is present

I think you should support your first claim that people will simply
harass me no matter what as I doubt this is true I think some of the
theists will be at a loss and that is enough reason for me
Because IN GOD WE TRUST is a motto on the coins and the coins
are a representation of the government christians are given
ammunition here to slander atheists as unpatriotic

So we should ban the ammunition  Why not get rid of the guns

And yes I have heard this used in conversation with christians
Sure they may fall back on other things but this is one they
should not have available to use

It is worse than others  The National Anthem  Should it be changed too
God Bless America  The list goes on

Imagine if the next year's set of coins were labeled with
the motto   GOD IS DEAD
Certainly such a statement on US coins would offend almost
every christian  And I'd be tempted to rub that motto in the
face of christians when debunking their standard motto slinging
gets boring

Then you'd be no better than the people you despise

Any statement printed on an item that represents
the government is an endorsement by the government

Oh

The coin motto is an endorsement of trusting in god

An endorsement or an acknowledgement  I think gods are things that people
are proud of but I don't think the motto encourages belief

I don't particularly feel like trusting in god
so the government IS putting me down with every
coin it prints

Is it


For the motto to be legitimate it would have to read
   In god gods or godlessness we trust

Would you approve of such a motto

Whether the motto was intended to be antiatheist or not
it turns up as an open invitation to use as an antiatheist tool

And removing the tool will solve the problem

Or will it increase the problem

liveseysolntzewpdsgicom Jon Livesey writes

I want to know how this omniscient being is going to perform
the feat of definitely terming actions right or wrong

If you were omniscient you'd know who exactly did what and with what
purpose in mind  Then with a particular goal in mind you sould be
able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance
with the general goal

I don't think you've show the existence of any objective moral system
They exist but in practice they are difficult to perfectly emulate
I mean you understand the concept of an objective system right
I thought you were explaining it to us   I certainly don't
understand what you are explaining

In an objective system there are known goals  Then actions are judged
as either being compatible with these goals or not  Simple  The problem
with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ  That is
the goals of each society are different

Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one

The concept of innocence is dependent on whether certain actions are
right or wrong and this depends on the moral system  But if
we have an objective system then someone can be deemed innocent or
not quite easily by an omniscient person  Anyway I think I cleared
up the recursive definition of murder because no one is complaining
about it
I don't think it solves anything to speculate where we would be
if we did have an objective moral system  The question is
still whether you can even say what one is

I've said it many many times

And for what it's worth I don't think you cleared up anything
concerning murder

Which part do you have a problem with

What do you mean by harmed  Is it harm if you have to spend
your existence metabolising food for another species
Oh most moral systems would be considered only within a species  It
is okay for us to enslave other animals right  But not humans
Of course ideally perhaps we wouldn't even have to bother any other
animals
One the first point it's wrong to enslave humans according to my
persoanl moral system  On the second point I'm a vegetarian

But we can enslave the animals right  But just not kill them  Or
are you a vegetarian for health reasons

So are you a vegetarian

No  I fail to see how my personal views are relevant anyway

Is it wrong to eat animals in your personal moral system

Of course not  It seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species
for food  It might be nice though if the other animals were not made
to suffer  For instance a cow in a field lives out its life just about
the same way it would in the wild  They seem happy enough  However
the veal youngsters aren't treated very well

How about an objective moral system

I don't know  What is the goal of this particular system  There is no
inherent system

How about a natural moral system

Nope  Again it seems okay to kill other species for food

counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups  I see in your posts a 
spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don'
t believe exactly as you do  If you're here to try to convert the atheists

If we worry about the one case in  or more where an innocent man is
convicted of something horrible enough to warrant the death penalty  and
hence put laws into place which make it virtually impossible to actually
execute real criminals  then the death penalty is not serving its original
purpose  It should either be changed or done away with


  I don't have numbers to back this up so take the following
  accordingly

  You use an offthecuff number of  in  innocent people
  sentenced to die as an acceptable loss for the benefit of capital
  punishment  I'd be very very surprised if the ratio were that
  low  There have been approximately a dozen known cases of the
  execution of the innocent in the US since the turn of the century
  Have we in that same period sentenced  people to death
  Accounting for those cases that we don't know the truth it seems
  reasonable to assume that twice that many innocent people have in
  fact been executed  That would raise the number of death
  sentences metered out since  to half a million for your
  acceptance ratio to hold  I rather doubt that's the case


  The point of course is what is an acceptable loss   in
    Seems we're probably not doing even that well   in 
   in   Or should we perhaps find a better solution

 

Bob Beauchaine bobbeviceICOTEKCOM 


Any suggestions as to what a better solution might be  I realize the
offhand nature of the numbers I used  And I can't answer as to what
an acceptable loss rate is  However  as I said in another post  I
despise the idea of supporting criminals for life  It's the economics
of the situation that concern me most  The money spent feeding clothing
housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are
unfit to live in society could go to a number of places  all of which
I and probably others  would consider far more worthwhile and which
would enrish the lives of all Americans  Give people jobs  give the

	The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a 
modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he was

Or he was just convinced by religious fantasies of the time that he was the
Messiah or he was just some rebel leader that an organisation of Jews built
into Godhood for the purpose off throwing of the yoke of Roman oppression
or

	Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows  Who would 
die for a lie 

Are the Moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into
Jewish embassies dying for the truth hint they think they are Were the
NAZI soldiers in WWII dying for the truth 

People die for lies all the time


Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar  People 

Was Hitler a liar How about Napoleon Mussolini Ronald Reagan We spend
millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying So the
answer is no they wouldn't be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied
about some things

gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing 
someone who was or had been healed  Call me a fool but I believe he did 
heal people  

Why do you think he healed people because the Bible says so But if God
doesn't exist the other possibility then the Bible is not divinely
inspired and one can't use it as a piece of evidence as it was written by
unbiased observers

	Niether was he a lunatic  Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
to someone who was crazy  Very doubtful in fact rediculous  For example 

Were Hitler or Mussolini lunatics How about Genghis Khan Jim Jones
there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to
lunatics

anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see 
this right away
	Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the 
real thing  

So we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other
possibilities not given in this triad

	Some other things to note  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in 
the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone  This in his betrayal 

Possibly selffulfilling prophecy ie he was aware what he should do in
order to fulfil these prophecies possibly selective diting on behalf of
those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the
general public had access possibly also that the text is written in such
riddles like Nostradamus that anything that happens can be twisted to fit
the words of raving fictional 'prophecy'

and Crucifixion  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I 
write I will use it
             stuff about how hard it is to be a christian deleted

I severely recommend you reconsider the reasons you are a christian they

 But chimps are almost human
 Does this mean that Chimps have a moral will
 
 Well chimps must have some system  They live in social groups
 as we do so they must have some laws dictating undesired behavior

Ah the verb to must   I was warned about that one back
in Kindergarten

So why must they have such laws

Get thee to a natural history museum or a library Mr Rawlins  How
do you explain the nearly complete skeletons of australopithecines and
other primal hominids like Homo erectus  Homo erectus was
certainly not an ape and it definitely was not a modern human either
Consider some of its morphological features small cranial capacity
supraorbital ridges receding forehead sharp angling of the occipital
bone receding chin large masseter muscles for chewing pentagonal
skull shape diastema between incisors and canines protruding
canines shovelshaped incisors  H erectus was bipedal though
So are these nearly complete skeletons of erectus human  Or ape
Or fanciful reconstructions  Have you even seen one

 Grow up childish propagandist

Gregg I'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice
things aren't quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim
them to be upsets you but exactly who is being childish here is 
open to question

BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank 
what will someone bet me they weren't real Islamic owners and
operators  and yet it actually turned out to be a longrunning
and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often
quite naive depositors

And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into
BCCI rather than the nasty interestmotivated western bank down
the street   Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned 
and operated bank couldn't possibly cheat them 

So please don't try to con us into thinking that it will all

 So you are saying that it isn't possible for an instinctive act
 to be moral one
 
 I like to think that many things are possible   Explain to me
 how instinctive acts can be moral acts and I am happy to listen
 
 For example if it were instinctive not to murder

Then not murdering would have no moral significance since there
would be nothing voluntary about it

 
 That is in order for an act to be an act of morality
 the person must consider the immoral action but then disregard 
 it
 
 Weaker than that   There must be the possibility that the
 organism  it's not just people we are talking about  can
 consider alternatives
 
 So only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other
 beings mimics theirs

You are starting to get the point   Mimicry is not necessarily the 
same as the action being imitated   A Parrot saying Pretty Polly 
isn't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of Polly

 And how much emphasis do you place on intelligence

See above

 Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but 
 they don't

They do   I and other posters have given you many examples of exactly
this but you seem to have a very short memory

 Are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because
 most animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do

I'm saying

	There must be the possibility that the organism  it's not 
	just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives

It's right there in the posting you are replying to

What if I act morally for no particular reason  Then am I moral  What
if morality is instinctive as in most animals
Saying that morality is instinctive in animals is an attempt to 
assume your conclusion
Which conclusion
You conclusion  correct me if I err  that the behaviour which is
instinctive in animals is a natural moral system

See we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here  Earlier you said
that it must be a conscious act  By your definition no instinctive
behavior pattern could be an act of morality  You are trying to apply
human terms to nonhumans  I think that even if someone is not conscious
of an alternative this does not prevent his behavior from being moral

You don't think that morality is a behavior pattern  What is human
morality  A moral action is one that is consistent with a given
pattern  That is we enforce a certain behavior as moral
You keep getting this backwards  You are trying to show that
the behaviour pattern is a morality  Whether morality is a behavior 
pattern is irrelevant since there can be behavior pattern for
example the motions of the planets that most all people would
not call a morality

I try to show it but by your definition it can't be shown

And morality can be thought of a large class of princples  It could be
defined in terms of many thingsthe laws of physics if you wish  However
it seems silly to talk of a moral planet because it obeys the laws of
phyics  It is less silly to talk about animals as they have at least
some free will

This whole thread started because of a discussion about whether
or not the death penalty constituted cruel punishment which is forbidden
by the US Constitution
Yes but they didn't say what they meant by cruel which is why
a you have the Supreme Court and b it makes no sense to refer
to the Constitution which is quite silent on the meaning of the
word cruel

They spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the Constitution  They
picked words whose meanings implied the intent  We have already looked
in the dictionary to define the word  Isn't this sufficient

Oh but we were discussing the death penalty and that discussion
resulted from the one about murder which resulted from an intial
discussion about objective moralityso this is already three times
removed from the morality discussion
Actually we were discussing the mening of the word cruel and
the US Constitution says nothing about that

But we were discussing it in relation to the death penalty  And the
Constitution need not define each of the words within  Anyone who doesn't
know what cruel is can look in the dictionary and we did

No that's just what you thought the theory meant  While all humans
are generally capable of overpowering their instincts it does not
follow that those who do this often are necessarily more intelligent
Ok so why aren't animals generally capable of overpowering their instincts

Good question  I'm sure some biologist could answer better than I
but animals brains are just set up differently

Animals can be trained but if they're instincts serve them well there is
no reason to contradict them

 I don't expect the lion to know or not know anything of the kind
 In fact I don't have any evidence that lions ever consider such 
 issues
 And that of course is why I don't think you can assign moral
 significance to the instinctive behaviour of lions
 
 What I've been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior
 That is it doesn't take much work to be moral but it certainly does to
 be immoral in some cases

That's the craziest thing I ever heard   Are you serious

	it doesn't take much work to be moral

 Also I've said that morality is a remnant of evolution  

Really   And that's why people discuss morality on a daily basis
Because it's a kind of evolutionary hangover like your little toe

 Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in the animal 
 kingdom

This must be some novel use of the phrase based on with which I
am not sufficiently familiar    What do you mean by based on and 
what is the significance of it for your argument

 
 So you are basically saying that you think a moral is an undefinable
 term and that moral systems don't exist  If we can't agree on a
 definition of these terms then how can we hope to discuss them
 
 No it's perfectly clear that I am saying that I know what a moral
 is in my system but that I can't speak for other people
 
 But this doesn't get us anywhere  Your particular beliefs are irrelevant
 unless you can share them or discuss them

Well we can   What would you like to know about my particular moral
beliefs

If you raise a topic I've never considered I'll be quite happy to 
invent a moral belief out of thin air

 Look I'm not the one that made those Nazi comparisons  Other people
 compared what the religious people are doing now to Nazi Germany  They
 have said that it started out with little things but no one really knew
 about any of these little things strangely enough and grew to bigger
 things  They said that the motto is but one of the little things 
 You just contradicted yourself  The motto is one of those little things that
 nobody has bothered mentiopning to you huh
 
 The little' things above were in reference to Germany clearly  People
 said that there were similar things in Germany but no one could name any
 They said that these were things that everyone should know and that they
 weren't going to waste their time repeating them  Sounds to me like no one
 knew either  I looked in some books but to no avail

That's not true    I gave you two examples   One was the rather
pevasive antisemitism in German Christianity well before Hitler
arrived   The other was the system of social ranks that were used
in Imperail Germany and Austria to distinguish Jews from the rest 
of the population

Neither of these were very terrible in themselves but both helped
to set a psychology in which the gradual disenfranchisement of Jews
was made easier

Excerpts from netnewsaltatheism Apr Re thoughts on christians
by Dave Fullerportalhqvi 
    I'm sick of religious types being pampered looked out for and WORST
 OF ALL     respected more than atheists There must be an end
 in sight
  
I think it'd help if we got a couple good atheists or even some good
steadfast agnostics in some high political offices  When was the last
time we had an openly atheist president  Have we ever  I don't
actually know these aren't rhetorical questions  How 'bout some
Supreme court justices  

One thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news
program on a local stationThe promo said something like Who are
these cults and why do they prey on the young  Ahem  EVER HEAR OF
BAPTISM AT BIRTH  If that isn't preying on the young I don't know what
is

I used to be ack barf a Catholic and was even confirmedShortly
thereafter I decided it was a load of BS  My mom who really insisted
that I continue to go to church felt it was her duty  to bring me up
as a believer  That was one of the more presumptuous things I've heard
in my life  I suggested we go talk to the priest and she agreed  The
priest was amazingly cool about itHe basically said that if I didn't
believe it there was no good in forcing it on me  Actually I guess he
wasn't amazingly cool about itHis response is what you'd hope for
indeed expect from a human being  I s'pose I just didn't expect
it  

I find it absurd that religion exists Yet I can also see its
usefulness to people  Facing up to the fact that you're just going to
be worm food in a few decades and that there isn't some cosmic purpose
to humanity and the universe can be pretty difficult for some people 
Having a readilyavailable predigested solution to this is pretty
attractive if you're either a gullible enough b willing to suspend
your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind or c have had the stuff
rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember  Religion in
general provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses Organized
religion provides a nice way to keep a population under control  

Blech

You know it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing
can be blamed solely on Mary

So she's married to Joseph  She gets knocked up  What do you think
ol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around  So Mary comes up
with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant  Actually it
can't be all THAT ridiculous considering the number of people that
believe it  Anyway she never tells anyone the truth and even tells
poor little Jesus that he's hot shit the Son of God  Everyone else
tells him this too since they've bought Mary's story  So what does
Mary actually turn out to be  An adultress and a liar and the cause of
mankind's greatest folly

Just my recentlyminted two cents

Well this is altatheism  I hope you arent here to try to convert anyone

It makes sense to be one

Many would disagree


The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a 
modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he was

Well you shouldn't give any particular book too much weight  Actually
I don't think that any of these statements is correct  It is more likely
that most of Jesus' fame was attributed to him after his death by those
who had some strong motives


Some other things to note  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in 
the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone

What's a prophecy and what's so significant about them

I don't think most people understand what a Christian is

I think we understand

It is certainly not what I see a lot in churches  Rather I think it 
should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's 
sake

Well sell your computer and donate you life to your religion now
Don't waste any time

I'll take a wild guess and say Freedom is objectively valuable  I base

almost all would want to complain  Therefore I take it that to assert or
believe that Freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see
that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on
a rainy day  I take this to be a candidate for an objective value and it
it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values
such as this exist

	You have only shown that a vast majority  if not all  would

Really  You don't know what objective value is  If I offered the people

sound like a good deal  
Well that would depend on how much we wanted the US and how much
we wanted the  wouldn't it
Yes it would  Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality  If I can
predict with almost  accuracy that Americans prefer to own their portions of
the US than an infinitesmal portion of  in what sense are these values
not objective
No I don't see what the popularity of a value has to do with whether
it is objective or not Pls explain

  I don't think I'm way off beam in saying that something is
better than nothing is a rational and objective valuation
Nope No tetanus is better than tetanus

 Do you agree
with me then that the assertion no values are objective is false
No

You now pushed down the defintion of objectivity into realm of
objective values So you need to explain that as well as well
as the objective subparts the objective atoms quarks
Firstly science has its basis in values not the other way round
You keep saying that I do not think it means what you think it
means
Perhaps you should explain what you think science has it's basis
in values means The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy
It's partly as you say the reason why people do science is that they value it's
results
Right

  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else
Twaddle You're overloading the meaning of the word value
that's all Whether I care if the results are true is a value
I fail to see how whether they are true correct whatever is
a value

  One cannot attach
any objective worth to the results of science  for the simple reason
that one cannot attach objective worth to anything  
You're overloading the value of worth too

Like I said before DES works whether I value my privacy or
not

A lie of omission as it were As opposed to an outright lie which I

However not only are the outputs of science subjectively valued so are
the inputs  More problems  Which facts to observe   What
is a fact  When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather
than noise  How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I
do  As a loyal relativist I must assume that what's signal for me
may not be signal for you  The objectivity postulate should not sit
well with me

So the relativist attends to a system designed at whim fed with what should 
be assumed to be conflicting data in the expectation of results which need 
satisfy noone  GIGO

 
Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'

As a loyal relativist  even you can partake in the wonders of
scientific discovery to borrow a phrase from D Letterman  Are you
like me  Do you like science and medicine

Difference is that science is based on consensus  The points above are
well made  and obviously there is some discussion as to what the
facts are in some cases  But if you are willing to play along with
the definitions  you too can hit the jackpot  Science also tends to
use the principle of totality vs locality  You can always look at a
small part of the macrocosm  yet those miniature pieces are still a
part of the total essence  So the facts to observe are those which
pertain to what questions you're asking  You may place a value on the
questions  but in many case  they are being asked just for the sake
of asking  And you can say that you're looking at a signal instead of
listening to noise  but the beauty of science is that it takes both
into account the totality aspect  For science to say that light is
a wave and NOT a particle or vice versa would be to ignore the total
essence that is light which is based upon the agreed upon definitions

Why even have definitions  Why agree upon them  Well to communicate in
such a way so that many will understand what you are saying  Where the
curiosity and drive come from I don't honestly know

I hope I haven't rambled too much  Not much sleep lately

Peace

Bobby Mozumder

I just thought of another one in the Bible so it's definately not because
of lack of religion  The Book of Esther which I read the other day for
other reasons describes the origin of Pur'im a Jewish celbration of joy
and peace  The long and short of the story is that  people were
killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions 
lying about you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice
peaceful solution  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to
mind

I agree with Bobby this far religion as it is used to kill large numbers
of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally
intended for

That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion it is
just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in
the Universe  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in
religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war  Many
people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own
stomachecontentsthan in any absolute truth and have therefore been driven to
kill by their leaders

The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often
lead to war  Whether these things are a part of religion an unpleasant
side effect or as Bobby would have it the result of people switching
between Religion and Atheism spontaneously the results are the same  

Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest
parts of Man's history

Atheists on the other hand preenpreen are typically not an ideological
social caste nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs
The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is  Two groups
with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to
further their means  Anyone who cannot see the obvious  namely that these
were groups founded for reasons entirely their own who used religious
persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more
powerfull  is trying too hard  Basically Bobby uses these examples
because there are so few wars that were not specifically fought over
religion that he does not have many choices

Well I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of
little silver butterdishes

 I want to know how this omniscient being is going to perform

 If you were omniscient you'd know who exactly did what and with what
 purpose in mind  Then with a particular goal in mind you sould be
 able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance
 with the general goal

But now you are contradicting yourself in a pretty massive way
and I don't think you've even noticed

In another part of this thread you've been telling us that the
goal of a natural morality is what animals do to survive

But suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long
term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some 
other species either terrestrial or alien

Does that make it moral to do so

 What if I act morally for no particular reason  Then am I moral  What
 if morality is instinctive as in most animals
 
 Saying that morality is instinctive in animals is an attempt to 
 assume your conclusion
 
 Which conclusion
 
 You conclusion  correct me if I err  that the behaviour which is
 instinctive in animals is a natural moral system
 
 See we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here  Earlier you said
 that it must be a conscious act  By your definition no instinctive
 behavior pattern could be an act of morality  You are trying to apply
 human terms to nonhumans

Pardon me   I am trying to apply human terms to nonhumans

I think there must be some confusion here   I'm the guy who is
saying that if animal behaviour is instinctive then it does not
have any moral sugnificance   How does refusing to apply human
terms to animals get turned into applying human terms

 I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative 
 this does not prevent his behavior from being moral

I'm sure you do think this if you say so   How about trying to
convince me

 
 You don't think that morality is a behavior pattern  What is human
 morality  A moral action is one that is consistent with a given
 pattern  That is we enforce a certain behavior as moral
 
 You keep getting this backwards  You are trying to show that
 the behaviour pattern is a morality  Whether morality is a behavior 
 pattern is irrelevant since there can be behavior pattern for
 example the motions of the planets that most all people would
 not call a morality
 
 I try to show it but by your definition it can't be shown

I've offered four times I think to accept your definition if
you allow me to ascribe moral significence to the orbital motion
of the planets

 
 And morality can be thought of a large class of princples  It could be
 defined in terms of many thingsthe laws of physics if you wish  However
 it seems silly to talk of a moral planet because it obeys the laws of
 phyics  It is less silly to talk about animals as they have at least
 some free will

Ah the law of silly and less silly   what Mr Livesey finds 
intuitive is silly but what Mr Schneider finds intuitive is less 
silly

Now that's a devastating argument isn't it

Well seeing as you are not muslim the sort of fatwa issued by Khomeini
would not be relevant to you I can understand your fear of persecution
and I share it even more than you being muslim however Rushdie's
behavior was not completely excusable

As much as I considered some of the socalled Islamrelated dialogue
here a total waste of time I somehow can't restrain myself in this
instance so Gregg try this

 PST  I come to my senses and accept the allknowing
wisdom and power of the Quran and Allah  Not only that but Allah 
himself drops by to congratulate me on my wise choice Allah rolls a
few bones and we get down  Then Allah gets out the Crisco bends 
over and invites me to take a spin around the block  Wow

 PST  I realize that maybe Allah is looking for more of a 
commitment than I'm ready for so I say Man I've got some
programming to do  Gotta go  I'll call you

 PST   Thinking it over I renounce Islam

BTW Gregg Allah said he still thinks of you

Yes but fortunately religions have been replaced by systems
that value Human Rights higher

Secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life
Islam places the rights of society and every member in it above 
the rights of the individual this is what I call true human rights

 
By the way do you actually support the claim of precedence of Islamic
Law In case you do what about the laws of other religions

As a Muslim living in a nonMuslim land I am bound by the laws of the land
I live in but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains a part of my 
life If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent
that I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must 
leave the land So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law
but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too

In an Islamic state one ruled by a Khaliphate religions other than Islam
are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don't affect
the genral population and don't come into direct conflict with state 
laws Dhimmis nonMuslim population are exempt from most Islamic laws
on religion such as fighting in a Jihad giving Zakat alms giving
etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military
protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat

 
If not what has it got to do with Rushdie And has anyone reliable
information if he hadn't left Islam according to Islamic law
Or is the burden of proof on him
   Benedikt

After the Fatwa didn't Rushdie reaffirm his faith in Islam didn't
he go thru' a very public conversion to Islam If so he is binding
himself to Islamic Laws He has to publicly renounce in his belief in Islam
so the burden is on him

Leonard I'll give you an example of this

My father recently bought a business the business price was  pounds
and my father approached the people in the community for help he raised
 pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and 
Muslims he knew  had cash and the rest he got a business loan after
paying off the Muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans
to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest this
is an example of a Muslim community helping one another why did they help
because of their common identity as Muslims In turn my father has helped
with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay 
and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more
fortunate in the community 

The fact is Leonard it DOES work without a fluffy bunny in sight
iThat is the beauty of Islam

Explain to me
how instinctive acts can be moral acts and I am happy to listen
For example if it were instinctive not to murder
Then not murdering would have no moral significance since there
would be nothing voluntary about it

See there you go again saying that a moral act is only significant
if it is voluntary  Why do you think this

And anyway humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts

So only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other
beings mimics theirs
You are starting to get the point  Mimicry is not necessarily the 
same as the action being imitated  A Parrot saying Pretty Polly 
isn't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of Polly

You are attaching too many things to the term moral I think
Let's try this  is it good that animals of the same species
don't kill each other  Or do you think this is right 

Or do you think that animals are machines and that nothing they do
is either right nor wrong


Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but 
they don't
They do  I and other posters have given you many examples of exactly
this but you seem to have a very short memory

Those weren't arbitrary killings  They were slayings related to some sort
of mating ritual or whatnot

Are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because
most animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do
I'm saying
	There must be the possibility that the organism  it's not 
	just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives
It's right there in the posting you are replying to

Yes it was but I still don't understand your distinctions  What
do you mean by consider  Can a small child be moral  How about
a gorilla  A dolphin  A platypus  Where is the line drawn  Does
the being need to be self aware

What do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of
the same species from arbitrarily killing each other  Don't
you find the fact that they don't at all significant

But suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long
term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some 
other species either terrestrial or alien

Now you are letting an omniscient being give information to me  This
was not part of the original premise

Does that make it moral to do so

Which type of morality are you talking about  In a natural sense it
is not at all immoral to harm another species as long as it doesn't
adversely affect your own I guess

Well chimps must have some system  They live in social groups
as we do so they must have some laws dictating undesired behavior
So why must they have such laws

The quotation marks should enclose laws not must

If there were no such rules even instinctive ones or unwritten ones
etc then surely some sort of random chance would lead a chimp society
into chaos

 The little' things above were in reference to Germany clearly  People
 said that there were similar things in Germany but no one could name any
 That's not true  I gave you two examples  One was the rather
 pevasive antisemitism in German Christianity well before Hitler
 arrived  The other was the system of social ranks that were used
 in Imperail Germany and Austria to distinguish Jews from the rest 
 of the population
 
 These don't seem like little things to me  At least they are orders
 worse than the motto  Do you think that the motto is a little thing

You don't think these are little things because with twentytwenty

 Leonard I'll give you an example of this
 
 My father recently bought a business the business price was  pounds
 and my father approached the people in the community for help he raised
  pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and 
 Muslims he knew  had cash and the rest he got a business loan after
 paying off the Muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans
 to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest this
 is an example of a Muslim community helping one another why did they help
 because of their common identity as Muslims In turn my father has helped
 with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay 
 and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more
 fortunate in the community 

Sorry   Wrong    This is how banks got started in the first place
Sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone
who eventually goes broke and then they will realise that they
havn't been managing risk very well   Then they will ask themselves
what it is that they need to quantify risk and to persuade borrowers
not to take on greater loans than they can carry    And since they
don't all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the
money some of them will specialise in that

Then they'll reinvent interest but like good Muslims they'll call
it something else

 
 The fact is Leonard it DOES work without a fluffy bunny in sight
 iThat is the beauty of Islam

Riiiight   That's why John Major opened a new government department
a couple of months ago to help to promote minority business   Because
they can do it all themselves by lending one another cups of sugar

 Explain to me
 how instinctive acts can be moral acts and I am happy to listen
 For example if it were instinctive not to murder
 
 Then not murdering would have no moral significance since there
 would be nothing voluntary about it
 
 See there you go again saying that a moral act is only significant
 if it is voluntary  Why do you think this

If you force me to do something am I morally responsible for it

 
 And anyway humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts

Well make up your mind    Is it to be instinctive not to murder
or not

 
 So only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other
 beings mimics theirs
 
 You are starting to get the point  Mimicry is not necessarily the 
 same as the action being imitated  A Parrot saying Pretty Polly 
 isn't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of Polly
 
 You are attaching too many things to the term moral I think
 Let's try this  is it good that animals of the same species
 don't kill each other  Or do you think this is right 

It's not even correct    Animals of the same species do kill
one another

 
 Or do you think that animals are machines and that nothing they do
 is either right nor wrong

Sigh   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop

I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance
I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals such as
primates have the beginnings of a moral sense since they seem
to exhibit selfawareness

 
 
 Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but 
 they don't
 
 They do  I and other posters have given you many examples of exactly
 this but you seem to have a very short memory
 
 Those weren't arbitrary killings  They were slayings related to some 
 sort of mating ritual or whatnot

So what     Are you trying to say that some killing in animals
has a moral significance and some does not   Is this your
natural morality


 
 Are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because
 most animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do
 
 I'm saying
 	There must be the possibility that the organism  it's not 
 	just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives
 
 It's right there in the posting you are replying to
 
 Yes it was but I still don't understand your distinctions  What
 do you mean by consider  Can a small child be moral  How about
 a gorilla  A dolphin  A platypus  Where is the line drawn  Does
 the being need to be self aware

Are you blind   What do you think that this sentence means

	There must be the possibility that the organism  it's not 
	just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives

What would that imply

 
 What do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of
 the same species from arbitrarily killing each other  Don't
 you find the fact that they don't at all significant

I find the fact that they do to be significant

  However I have read a book
  
    GA Wells DidJesusExist
  
    ISBN 
  
  I found it to be thorough and interesting but perhaps not the end of the
  story
  
  Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating 
  to questions of science
 
      There is a great fallacy in your statement The question of origins is
      based on more than science alone  If you met a man who could walk on
      water raise people from the dead claimed to be the Son of God and
      then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures this would affect
      your belief in the origin of man  I can expand on this  Science and
      the Bible are not in contradiction  God can supercede the scientific
      laws as man understands them  Creation is a good example  God has the
      power to create something out of nothing order out of chaos
      If the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the 
      substance of the book it must be a real laugher  Of course Jesus existed
      and there are volumes of evidence to back it up  I can give many if you
      are interested
 	If I were to experience this strange creature for myself perhaps
 
 	However one highly biased account as well as possibly internally 
 inconsistent written over  mellenia ago in a dead language by fanatic
 devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more 
 objective sources and isnt  even accepted by those who's messiah this creature 
 was supposed to be doesn't convince me in the slightest especially when many
 of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of 
 guano

       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you don't want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony  
 

I have left all the above in as context

It is strange that you mention Josephus since Wells claims 
that historians and theologians widely regard the two mentions in Josephus to be 
Christian interpolations I have also heard others make this claim

In addition Wells claims that there are areas of disharmony in the four 
gospel accounts Any harmony that you find is perhaps not surprising as there 
seems to be evidence that Matthew and Luke are based on Mark and other
documents

In article Aprramboatlantadgcom wpratlantadgcom 
	Bill Rawlins writes


        The problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the
        supernatural in the question of origins  Is this is a fair premise
        I utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of
        truth

Well I rather think that you have shown your hand here 

I suspect that many people would agree that the scientific method has replaced 
mythology and mysticism as method of finding out about the world One might even
call it the best source of truth we have available today

I will offer you a little deal

I will read the NT the OT and the Torah NT and OT will be NEB or RSV 
versions over the next  months if you will read DidJesusExist and stick
to it past the first chapter This is not such an onerous task on my part I will
admit as I have already decided to read the  I mentioned 

Maybe when you have read it you can tell me what you think

    We are talking about origins not merely science   Science cannot
    explain origins

So you have claimed but you have never explained why In detail

  For a person to exclude anything but science from
    the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth
    than science  This is a false premise  By the way I enjoy science
    It is truly a wonder observing God's creation  Macroevolution is
    a mixture of  percent science and  percent religion guaranteed
    within three percent error  

Again you have claimed this but you have never explained You never
did explain how deducing macroevolution from its observable consequenses
effects is different from deducing Earth's roundness its position in
the solar system the existence of atoms and its components etc from
observable effects

Well that's the question isn't it  The goals are probably not all that

so perhaps you'd like to review it for us and tell us what the
difference is between an omniscient being be able to assign right
and wrong to actions and telling us the result is 

Omniscience is fine as long as information is not given away  Isn't
this the resolution of the free will problem  An interactive omniscient
being changes the situation

Which type of morality are you talking about  In a natural sense it
is not at all immoral to harm another species as long as it doesn't
adversely affect your own I guess
I'm talking about the morality introduced by you which was going to
be implemented by this omniscient being that can definitely assign
right and wrong to actions
You tell us what type of morality that is

Well I was speaking about an objective system in general  I didn't
mention a specific goal which would be necessary to determine the
morality of an action

 My definition of objective would be absolute or fixed rather than
   subjective or varying and changing

      Inotherwords any moral system that is still what we're talking
about right can be 'objective' provided you stick to it no matter
what Doesn't sound good to me stifles progress

 I hold that an objective moral system exists regardless of my knowledge or 
 application of it  I relate it to the idea that there is scientific truth 
 that is truth even though I may not know about it  

      Aha this would put the definition much closer to the moral
absolutism I'm more aquainted to debating

 Some morals I wouldn't want to change and would not consider it progress 
 for a society to oneday say that rape and murder are ok

      We all agree that it's rather unlikely as the definitions of
rape and murder are tied to the definitions of evil more like
impossible actually but what if some society someday actually hit
on a good sound reason for why rape and murder should be moral

 Some underlying themes morality honesty courage respect etc are
 used to base actions  I don't consider the idea that we should have
 been moral should be moral now and should be so in the future a
 limitation when it includes such morality

      I don't quite parse this but you seem to be saying absolute
morals are defensible insofar as we consider them good Which of
course is correct but then you need an absolute definition of good

 Aberrances in a moral system ie it is immoral to marry
 someone of the opposite sex it is immoral to listen to rock and roll etc 

      Hang on  what's an aberrance in a moral system
Do you mean moral codes that seem useless or bad perchance But your
judgement of what exactly is 'useless' andor 'bad' is your own opinion
subjective not objective

  if specific actions are given
 moral status I tend to question those morals

      Me too and add in all unmotivated morals and laws as well

I'm only saying that anything can happen under atheism  Being a
beleiver a knowledgeable one in religion only good can happen

This is becoming a tiresome statement  Coming from you it is 
a definition not an assertion

   Islam is good  Belief in Islam is good  Therefore being a 
   believer in Islam can produce only goodbecause Islam is
   good Blah blah blah

That's about as circular as it gets and equally meaningless  To
say that something produces only good because it is only good that 
it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition  And
all you're application is saying that it's true if you really 
believe it's true  That's silly

Conversely you say offhandedly that anything can happen under
atheism  Again just an offshoot of believeitanditbecomestrue
don'tbelieveitanditdoesn't  

Like other religions I'm aquainted with Islam teaches exclusion and
caste and suggests harsh penalties for behaviors that have no
logical call for punishment certain limits on speech and sex for
example  To me this is not good  I see much pain and suffering
without any justification except for the waving of the hand of
some inaccessible god

By the by you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly
For what is a knowledgeable believer except a contradiction of
terms  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith
And If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing
to do with it does it

Sorry to insult your homestate but coming from where I do Wisconsin
is very backwards  I was never able to understand that people actually
held such bigoted and backwards views until I came here

I have never been to Wisconsin though I have been to
neighbor Minnesota Being a child of the Middle Atlantic NY NJ PA
I found that there were few states in the provences that stood
out in this youngster's mind California Texas and Florida to 
name the most obvious three  However both Minnesota and Wisconsin
stuck out solely on the basis of their politics  Both have 
always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states
And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that
state's reputation  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the
same  At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota left
with me about their neighbors

The only question in my head about Wisconsin though is 
whether or not there is a causeeffect relationship between
cheese and serial killers

 Science the real world has its basis in values not the other way round 
 as you would wish it 

That's a mighty bold assertion Care to prove it

Theories judged to be simple by people  Predictions judged to
be accurate by people   These are value judgements and science doesn't 
work without them

 If there is no such thing as objective value then 
 science can not objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head

I never said it is useful or useless I say it is an accurate description
of what occurs people or no people values or no values

Accurate in whose opinion  Yours  Is the fact that it seems to be an 
accurate description which applies to everyone of no relevance  

 One assumes objective reality one doesn't know it  

But one can get supporting evidence from the fact that the reality behaves
the same way in the same situation every time that situaton occurs 

The same can not be said of morals

Confidently asserted falsehood  On the one hand people can demonstrate 
that they value freedom as consistently as they can report the rising of 
the sun  People will disagree if you say freeedom is worthless no less 
often than they will disagree if you say evolution or for that matter QM or
relativity is an accurate description of observed phenomena  On the
other hand even in the face of a certain amount of disagreement it remains
reasonable to believe in the value of freedom and that QM etc is an accurate 
description of observed phenomena

 It really looks like these people have no idea at all of what it means
 to be atheist  There are more Bobby Mozumder clones in the world than
 I thought

Well that explains some things I posted on socreligionislam
with an attached quote by Bobby to the effect that all atheists
are lying evil scum and asked if it was a commonlyheld idea
among muslims  I got no response  Asking about the unknown
I guess

You should have tried one of the socculture groups in the Middle East
or South Asia area they are a little more open than the Islam channel  
I think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the 
world created itself or something like that so each particle is a God 
which created the other Gods  The soccultureafrican is also nice for 
some contrasting viewpoints on the benevolence of religion  Especially 
when Sudan is mentioned

 you can't force your view of objective morality on me  
 
 Try me
 
 Note to readers outside ta    
 
 taite has been advocating violent civil disobedience in the US
 in order to promote his view that abortion should be illegal  Given the
 necessity and the opportunity I would have no objection to forcing 
 morality on him if that's what it would take to prevent him carrying out
 his stated desire to hang women who have multiple abortions 

What do you mean when you say I would have no objection

Right I mean that I would approve of and if necessary it isn't
assist in such force

Do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates
the use of force

With a few provisos yes  Minimum force for a start And it
depends on what is being forced on either side   

Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such
people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing
that our own actions in doing so are not moral

My opinion is that our actions would be moral and it would be
immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective  
Again there many caveats and provisios

Note my usage of my opinion is an admission that I don't have a lock
on morals not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on

  Really  You don't know what objective value is  If I offered the people
  of the US collectively  for all of the land in America would that 
  sound like a good deal  
 
 You mean that if you can find a ridiculous price the rest of
 us are supposed to conclude that an objectively correct price
 exists

Another Gedanken experiment is selling the London bridge adjusted to
this situation selling USA for  to a foreign tourist Yet again
is this an objective deal

Good question  Under the assumption that things are as they are
and the seller is not the owner I assume this is what you mean
then one can say that with high confidence that this is a bad deal
for any tourist regardless of their private beliefs  There isn't
enough information to draw good conclusions about the seller  but one
could say with less confidence that it can be a good deal for any seller  
That the seller and buyer come out with different values on the deal is 
not relativism since in fact any number of disinterested observers can 
predict this which sounds pretty objective to me

Perhaps you should explain what you think science has it's basis
in values means The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy
It's partly as you say the reason why people do science is that they value it's
results
Right

  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else
Twaddle You're overloading the meaning of the word value
that's all Whether I care if the results are true is a value
I fail to see how whether they are true correct whatever is
a value

The result's actual truth is independent of what you think of it if you
care to look at it that way  however your perception of a result's
truth cannot match its actual truth unless you care to follow the a
procedure to obtain truth science correctly  You have to pick 
the right procedure and note its importance  You've got to value it
Otherwise you don't care about actual truth and shouldn't object
to the statement objectivism is true

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively and science is a procedure
science cannot be valued nonsubjectively   If we're picking facts
and hypotheses subjectively then we are using a maybenotquitesure
method on maybenotquitesure observations  That should lead
to maybenotquitesure results no  The fact that it does not seem
to might make one question the premise which is that our subjective
valuations are necessarily unreliable

No wait  I've a better idea  And the result's actual truth is
Yeah that's the ticket

Like I said before DES works whether I value my privacy or
not

OK which DES  The abstract function DES that stops working in any 
important sense if noone cares for the importance of truth mathematics 
meaning information etc  A DES chip or DES sw  That stops working in any 
important sense if noone values science objective reality etc   DES
does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either

If a person gives a wellbalanced reasoned argument Tammy then all are
happy to discuss it with him  If he makes astounding claims which are not
backed up with any evidence then he must be expected to substantiate them
If the original author had said that everything was his own opinion and not
supportable then people would have simply ignored him  He did not  He
claimed many things and his logic was seriously flawed  His argument was for
christianity in an effort to try to convince atheists like myself to believe

 Science the real world has its basis in values not the other way round 
 as you would wish it  
 
 You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I
 see it used normally
 
 And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to
 the real world
 
 Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe
 and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning
 those perceptions

Science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed
interpretations of our observations perceptions

 It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see
 Values are  well they are what I value
 They are what I would have rather than not have  what I would experience
 rather than not and so on

Values can also refer to meaning  For example in computer science the
value of  is TRUE and  is FALSE  Science is based on commonly agreed
values interpretation of observations although science can result in a
reinterpretation of these values

 Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are
 applicable to everyone

The values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been
fully agreed and the change with time  The values of Newtonian physic are
certainly different to those of Quantum Mechanics

 It's partly as you say the reason why people do science is that they value it's
 results  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
 and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
 valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else  One cannot attach
 any objective worth to the results of science  for the simple reason
 that one cannot attach objective worth to anything

So what The value I assign the results is as real to me as they can get
I'm just not limited to how things are valuable to me Aside from our own
desires for its results science has no value Nevertheless it still
accurately describes how the universe works humans or no humans  

You were doing fine until that last sentence  I believe this too
but please prove it

  Which facts to observe

That's the value judgement you're confusing and a question for an
individual researcher For science the answer is unequvocal all

Impossible One observes the simple facts the ones that are likely to
turn up again  Judgement call  You can't observe everything and you
can't test every hypothesis  Therefore you select  That's a bunch
of subjective people judging the importance of obs and hypotheses 
can they do this reliably  

  What is a fact  When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather than noise  How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I do

You don't That's why it takes substantially more than one observation
before a newly observed phenomenon is judged to be real or noise I suppose
you didn't know that there are still people out there making observations
to further verify Fma 

judged to be real or noise  How do I do this  Do you do it the same
way as I do  How do we know this  Are we assuming an objective reality
or something  Gee maybe we are and judgement is necessary to find out
what it is

 So the relativist attends to a system designed at whim fed with what should 
 be assumed to be conflicting data in the expectation of results which need 
 satisfy noone  GIGO

Strawman You're mixing relativism in value for relativism in observation

Relativism in value  if we all pick different observations to study it
                       doesn't matter  We don't know which obs are
                       important

Relativism in value  if we all pick doctored observations to study it
                       doesn't matter  We don't know which obs are
                       important

Relativism in value  we all pick different systems to examine phenomena it
                       doesn't matter  We don't know which system works
                       well  Tarot cards are science too

No mixup  I still don't like the conclusions which is why I question
the premise that subjective value judgements can never be assumed to be 
reliable and therefore correct

You've been barking up this tree for some time and you haven't gotten
anywhere

I've been looking for the separation of church and state in Ireland since
I was  and haven't gotten anywhere  So what

 with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant  
 

  Nice attempt Chris    verrry close

  You missed the conspiracy by  step Joseph knew who knocked her up
He couldn't let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol' Mary prego That
wouldn't do well for his popularity in the local circles So what 
happened is that she was feeling guilty he was feeling embarrassed and
THEY decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise
been the downfall for both Clever indeed Come to think of it    I
have gained a new respect for the couple Maybe Joseph and Mary should

 Fallacy  Atheism is a faith Lo I hear the FAQ beckoning once again
 wonderful Rule  deleted  you're correct you didn't say anything about

 Correction hard atheism is a faith

Yes
 
 
 Rule   Don't mix apples with oranges  How can you say that the
 extermination by the Mongols was worse than Stalin  Khan conquered people
 unsympathetic to his causeThat was atrociousBut Stalin killed millions of
 his own people who loved and worshipped him and his atheist stateHow can

 I will not explain this to you again Stalin did nothing in the name of
 atheism Whethe he was or was not an atheist is irrelevant
 
 Get a grip man  The Stalin example was brought up not as an
 indictment of atheism but merely as another example of how people will
 kill others under any name that's fit for the occasion

No look again While you never said it the implication is pretty clear
I'm sorry but I can only respond to your words not your true meaning Usenet
is a slippery medium 

deleted wrt the burden of proof
 
 So hard atheism has nothing to prove  Then how does it justify that
 God does not exist  I know there's the FAQ etc  But guess what  if
 those justifications were so compelling why aren't people flocking to
 hard atheism  They're not and they won't  I for one will discourage
 people from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable
 statements on hard atheism
 
Look I'm not supporting any dogmatic position I'd be a fool to say that
in the large group of people that are atheists no people exist who wish to
proselytize in the same fashion as religion How many hard atheists do you 
see posting here anyway Maybe I'mm just not looking hard enough

 Second what makes you think I'm defending any given religion  I'm merely
 recognizing hard atheism for what it is a faith

I never meant to do so although I understand where you might get that idea
I was merely using the 'bible' example as an allegory to illustrate my
point

 
 And yes by we I am referring to every reader of the post  Where is the
 evidence that the poster stated that he relied upon

Evidence for what Who I think I may have lost this thread
 
why theists are arrogant deleted
 Because they say Suchandsuch is absolutely unalterably True because
          
 my dogma says it is True I am not prepared to issue blanket statements
 indicting all theists of arrogance as you are wont to do with atheists
 
 Bzzt  By virtue of your innocent little pronoun they you've just issued
 a blanket statement  At least I will apologize by qualifying my original
 statement with hard atheist in place of atheist  Would you call John the
 Baptist arrogant who boasted of one greater than he  That's what many
 Christians do today  How is that in itself arrogant

Guilty as charged What I meant to say was the theists who are arrogant
are this way because they say   Other than that I thought my meaning
was clear enough Any position that claims itself as superior to another with
no supporting evidence is arrogant Thanks for your apology btw

 
  I'm not worthy

 With your sophisticated putdown of they the theists your serious
 misinformation shines through

 So let's see If some guy writes a piece with a title that implies
 something is the case then it must be so is that it

Gregg you haven't provided even a title of an article to support your
contention

  This is how you support a position if you intend to have anyone
  respect it Gregg  Any questions  And I even managed to include
  the above reference with my head firmly engaged in my ass  What's
  your excuse
 
 This supports nothing I have no reason to believe that this is 
 piece is anything other than another antiIslamic slander job

You also have no reason to believe it is an antiIslamic slander job apart
from your own prejudices

 I have no respect for titles only for real content I can look
 up this article if I want true But I can tell you BCCI was not
 an Islamic bank

Why yes  What's a mere report in The Times stating that BCCI followed
Islamic banking rules  Gregg knows Islam is good and he knows BCCI were
bad therefore BCCI cannot have been Islamic  Anyone who says otherwise is
obviously spreading slanderous propaganda

                                      If someone wants to discuss
 the issue more seriously then I'd be glad to have a real discussion
 providing references etc

I see  If someone wants to provide references to articles you agree with
you will also respond with references to articles you agree with  Mmm yes
that would be a very intellectually stimulating debate  Doubtless that's how
you spend your time in soccultureislam

I've got a special place for you in my

kill file  Right next to Bobby  Want to join him

The more you post the more I become convinced that it is simply a waste of
time to try and reason with Moslems  Is that what you are hoping to achieve

  Yet I am still not a believer  Is god not concerned with my
  disposition  Why is it beneath him to provide me with the
  evidence I would require to believe  The evidence that my
  personality given to me by this god would find compelling

The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to 
But think about it for a minute  Would you rather have someone love
you because you made them love you or because they wanted to
love you     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward
Him  He promises to be there for you but you have to look for yourself
Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort
Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you will see
that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic
Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  Yet some think it is
the ultimate  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
know more than you do now   To learn you must accept that which
you don't know

 This deserves framing  It really does  Atoms aren't even real
 
 Tell me then those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are
 atoms now so what are they  Figments of our imaginations  The
 evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming but I won't bother with
 most evidence at the moment

HA HA HA

Sorry but having studied cell biology I have to say that I can see it
through an electron microscope THEREFORE it is real is a laughable
statement

Thank you  I thought I was in the twilight zone for a moment
It still amazes me that many people with science backgrounds 
still confuse the models and observables with what even they
would call the real world

How does one falsify any origin theory For example are a forever existing
universe or abiogenesis strictly falsifiable

The same way that any theory is proven false  You examine the predicitions
that the theory makes and try to observe them  If you don't or if you
observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen then you have some 
evidence against the theory  If the theory can't be modified to 
incorporate the new observations then you say that it is false

For example people used to believe that the earth had been created
 years ago  But as evidence showed that predictions from this 
theory were not true it was abandoned

Russ PaulJones
russpjmicrosoftcom

But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment In many types ofexperiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will happen again
and be capable of being observed For example in chemistry someone may predict
the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction 
repeatedly You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that
produced life So it seems we could never say That's exactly how it happenedAs far as we know that event was unobserved At least no one has admitted
it   So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability
strictly speaking are lacking

Bullshit  This is true only under your ad hoc assertion that only
religion can explain origins  The history of life through
macroevolution is a falsifiable theory  If you think it's not then
make some substantial argument against it

The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be

 There lies the hypocrisy dude  Atheism takes as much faith as theism  
 Admit it

Some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist but faith in
what  Does it take some kind of faith to say that the Great Invisible Pink
Unicorn does not exist  Does it take some kind of faith to say that Santa
Claus does not exist  If it does and it may for some people I suppose it
certainly isn't as big a leap of faith to say that these things and god
DO exist  I suppose it depends on your notion and definition of faith

Besides not believing in a god means one doesn't have to deal with all
of the extra baggage that comes with it  This leaves a person feeling
wonderfully free especially after beaten over the head with it for years
I agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer
for many people and for that reason I think it's important  However
trying to force a psychological fantasy I don't mean that in a bad way
but that's what it really is on someone else who isn't interested is
extremely rude  What if I still believed in Santa Claus and said that my
belief in Santa did wonderful things for my life making me a better
person allowing me to live without guilt etc and then tried to get
you to believe in Santa too just 'cuz he did so much for me  You'd call
the men in white coats as soon as you could get to a phone

I apologize for the long delay in getting a response to this posted
I've been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had
a son born the day after Umar's article was posted btw  I did

this was in response to the claim that Rushdie made false statements

but where is the line between fact and fiction  I stand by this
distinction between fiction and false statements

However it's not for his writing in The Satanic Verses but for
what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is
contained in that book  I have yet to find one single muslim who
has convinced me that they have read the book  Some have initially
claimed to have done so but none has shown more knowledge of the book
than a superficial Newsweek story might impart and all have made
factual misstatements about events in the book

You keep saying things like this  Then you accuse people like me of
making ad hominem arguments  I repeat as I have said in previous
postings on AA I have read TSV from cover to cover

I had not seen that claim or I might have been less sweeping  You
have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the
book which I have raised in the past in the ISLAM a clearer view

thread  My statement was not that you had not read the book but that
you had not convinced me that you inter alia had  As I said before
if you want to defend your position then produce evidence and
respond to the evidence I have posted so far you have not  Of
course my statement was not directly aimed at you but broadly at a
number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book
indicating that they haven't read it and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger
who subsequently admitted that he hadn't in fact read the book
vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case

So far the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a
the statements you made concerning the book in the a clearer view
posting which I have challenged not interpretation but statements
of fact for instance Rushdie depicts the women of the most
respected family in all of Islam as whores and b your claim which
I had not seen before this that you have indeed read it cover to
cover  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on
critical interpretation but you'll have to support your end by
responding to my criticism  I have no doubt as to the ability of a
particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding
passages to take personal offense at but you have upheld the view
that TSV is intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims  This
view must be defended by more than mere assertion if you want anyone
to take it seriously

I am trying very hard to be amicable and rational  

And I appreciate it but welcome to the club  I am defending my
honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated
or otherwise insulting attack on Islam and the parallel opinion
that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless
propaganda  I have supported my statements and critical
interpretationa with incontext quotes from the book and Rushdie's
essays which is more than my correspondents have done  Of course
you are more than welcome to do so

 Many atheists do not mock the concept of a god they are shocked that
 so many theists have fallen to such a low level that they actually
 believe in a god  You accuse all atheists of being part of a conspiracy
 again without evidence

 Rule   Condescending to the population at large ie theists will not
 win many people to your faith anytime soon  It only ruins your credibility

Fallacy  Atheism is a faith Lo I hear the FAQ beckoning once again
wonderful Rule  deleted  you're correct you didn't say anything about
a conspiracy

Correction hard atheism is a faith

 Rule   Don't mix apples with oranges  How can you say that the
 extermination by the Mongols was worse than Stalin  Khan conquered people
 unsympathetic to his cause That was atrocious But Stalin killed millions of
 his own people who loved and worshipped him and his atheist state  How can
 anyone be worse than that

I will not explain this to you again Stalin did nothing in the name of
atheism Whethe he was or was not an atheist is irrelevant

Get a grip man  The Stalin example was brought up not as an
indictment of atheism but merely as another example of how people will
kill others under any name that's fit for the occasion

 Rule   If you rely on evidence state it  We're waiting

As opposed to relying on a bunch of black ink on some crumbling old paper
Atheism has to prove nothing to you or anyone else It is the burden of
dogmatic religious bullshit to provide their 'evidence' Which 'we'
might you be referring to and how long are you going to wait

So hard atheism has nothing to prove  Then how does it justify that
God does not exist  I know there's the FAQ etc  But guess what  if
those justifications were so compelling why aren't people flocking to
hard atheism  They're not and they won't  I for one will discourage
people from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable
statements on hard atheism

Second what makes you think I'm defending any given religion  I'm merely
recognizing hard atheism for what it is a faith

And yes by we I am referring to every reader of the post  Where is the
evidence that the poster stated that he relied upon

 Oh yes though I'm not a theist I can say safely that by definition many
 theists are not arrogant since they boast about something outside
 themselves namely a god or gods  So in principle it's hard to see how
 theists are necessarily arrogant

Because they say Suchandsuch is absolutely unalterably True because
         
my dogma says it is True I am not prepared to issue blanket statements
indicting all theists of arrogance as you are wont to do with atheists

Bzzt  By virtue of your innocent little pronoun they you've just issued
a blanket statement  At least I will apologize by qualifying my original
statement with hard atheist in place of atheist  Would you call John the
Baptist arrogant who boasted of one greater than he  That's what many
Christians do today  How is that in itself arrogant

 I'm not worthy
Only seriously misinformed
With your sophisticated putdown of they the theists your serious
misinformation shines through

Hmm This agrees with the Ptolemic system of the earth at the centre
with the planets orbitting round it So Copernicus and Gallileo were
wrong after all

You haven't read very carefully  if you look again you will see that
it doesn't say anything about what is circling what
 
Anyway they are not moving in circles  

Oops sorry my words not the words of the Qur'an

Nor is there any evidence that
everything goes around in a rounded course in a general sense Wishy
washy statements are not scientific

Note that the celestial bodies in the above verse is an
interpolation which is why it is in brackets  it is the translator's 
incorrect IMHO interpretation

Here is Maurice Bucaille's translation he studied Arabic for his
research into the Qur'an and science of this verse

God is the One Who created the night the day the sun and the moon
Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion Qur'an 

The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr Maurice Bucaille is that
while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time and for
a long time afterwards there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse
or anywhere in the Qur'an

I'll yield the discussion on absolute morality until I can think of another way
to discuss it  If you're interested in a change here's an idea

If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that What right do
we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality
Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your brother and say that I was 
exercising my rights as I saw them was doing what felt good didn't want
anyone forcing their morality on me or I don't follow your morality 

Yes and then you can suffer the consequences in our collective decision to
incarcerate you for that act Morality is not a necessity for a functional
collection of peoples just a set of acceptable behaviours is this the same
thing  There is no universal moral standard as there are many different
situations in which collections of social organisms find themselves Some
species of bees see nothing wrong with kicking out a large number of male
bees because they are being a burden on the food supplies of the colony The
bees die of course but it was for the good of the colony as a whole so was
it immoral 

Our society at least our western one is one of abundance when it comes to
the basics food water and shelter  Therefore our moral standards are
based upon those circumstances  Unfortunately we enforce our moral
standards on collections of peoples who are not in similar situations
because we believe in some universal morality  What I am saying is that
yes you CAN still murder my sibling but don't expect your peers to be
impressed by it in our society However in some other circumstances it may
actually be a moral thing to do in which case it wouldn't be called
murder probably sacrifice After the act you could say what you liked
but you must make a conscious decision on whether or not your society will
condone your act so as to evaluate the consequences to yourself including
how you will feel about it remember your feelings have been socially
imbued

Various quotes deleted in the interest of saving a little bit of
bandwidth but i will copy the Koran quote
AND IT IS HE GOD ALMIGHTY WHO CREATED THE NIGHT AND THE
DAY AND THE SUN AND THE EARTH  ALL THE CELETIAL BODIES
SWIM ALONG EACH IN ITS ROUNDED COURSE  Holy Quran 

As it has been pointed out this quote makes no claim about what
orbits what  The idea that something orbited something had been held
as true for many years before the Koran was written so the fact that
it says something orbits something is hardly surprising insight  My
concern is with the word rounded 

There are two interpretations of this word
 It means in a circle  This is wrong although many believed it to
be true at the time the Koran was written  In other words it is not
describing our neighborhood of the universe as it really exists but
as it was thought to be at the time  This has implications which i
hope are obvious to everyone
 It means in a rounded shape which could include elipses the
geometrical form which most nearly describes the orbits of the
planets  This is also not a great insight  Look at the shapes you
see in nature  Very few of them even approach a square or rectangle
those are humancreated shapes  Everything in nature is rounded to
some degree  Even the flatearthers don't try to claim Earth is a
rectangle  Children who draw imaginary animals seldom give them
rectangular bodies  We seem to instinctively recognize that nature
produces rounded shapes hence the assumption that the orbits of the
planets would be round hardly takes divine inspiration

It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an
interpretation so as you point out below one must really go back to
the original Arabic  Regarding the verses relevant to nature I prefer
to use Dr Maurice Bucaille's translations in his book The Bible the
Qur'an and Science for in general his translations are more literal
 
Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing
as 

Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion

Also note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quoted
by you above is the translator's interpolation  it is not existent in
the original Arabic which is why it is included in brackets 

Perhaps someone who can read the original Arabic can eliminate one of
these interpretations at any rate neither one of them is exactly
impressive

You're right what the verses do contain isn't all that remarkable

However Dr Bucaille a surgeon that's how he's a Dr thinks it is
significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas even
though geocentrism was all the rage up until the th century  or so
And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well which has about 
verses or so regarding nature I think I remember reading once

     With the Southern Baptist Convention convening this June to consider
the charges that Freemasonry is incompatible with christianity I thought
the following quotes by Mr James Holly the AntiMasonic Flag Carrier
would amuse you all

     The following passages are exact quotes from The Southern 
Baptist Convention and Freemasonry by James L Holly MD President
of Mission and Ministry To Men Inc  N th St Beaumont TX 
 
 
     The inside cover of the book states Mission  Ministry to Men 
Inc hereby grants permission for the reproduction of part or all of 
this booklet with two provisions one the material is not changed and
two the source is identified I have followed these provisions 
  
     Freemasonry is one of the allies of the Devil Page iv 
 
     The issue here is not moderate or conservative the issue is God
and the Devil Page vi 
 
     It is worthwhile to remember that the formulators of public 
school education in America were Freemasons Page  
 
     Jesus Christ never commanded toleration as a motive for His 
disciples and toleration is the antithesis of the Christian message
Page  
 
     The central dynamic of the Freemason drive for world unity 
through fraternity liberty and equality is toleration This is seen 
in the writings of the 'great' writers of Freemasonry Page  
 
     He Jesus Christ established the most sectarian of all possible 
faiths Page  
 
     For narrowness and sectarianism there is no equal to the Lord 
Jesus Christ Page  
 
     What seems so right in the interest of toleration and its 
cousinsliberty equality and fraternityis actually one of the 
subtlest lies of the 'father of lies' Page  
 
     The Southern Baptist Convention has many churches which were 
founded in the Lodge and which have corner stones dedicated by the 
Lodge Each of these churches should hold public ceremonies of 
repentance and of praying the blood and the Name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ over the church and renouncing the oaths taken at the 
dedication of the church andor building Page

MoralEthical behavior  Societally acceptable behavior

I disagree with these  What society thinks should be irrelevant  What the
individual decides is all that is important


Who is society

I think this is fairly obvious


How do they define what is acceptable

Generally by what they feel is right which is the most idiotic policy I can

 Hi
 
 I have been having an argument about the origins of the bible lately with
 a theist acquaintance  He stated that thousands of bibles were discovered
 at a certain point in time which were syllableperfect  This therefore
 meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time the time quoted
 by my acquaintace was approximately  years after the death of Jesus

Hi Adda

Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain
time  the time when the author wrote it  Unfortunately like all works
from this time period and earlier all that exists today are copies 

 
 Cutting all of the crap out of the way ie god wrote it could anyone answer
 the following
 
   How old is the oldest surviving copy of the new testament

There are parts of books scraps really that date from around the
mid second century AD   There are some complete books letters
etc from the middle third century  The first complete collection of
the New Testament dates from the early th century AD   Throughout
this period are writings of various early church fathersleaders who
quoted various scriptures in their writings

   Is there any truth in my acquaintance's statements

If you mean that someone discovered thousands of Bibles which were all
perfect copies dating from the last part of the st centuryNo

If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts within the
dates given above but not letter perfect and that the most probable
text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest
original autographs now lost probably were written starting sometime
shortly after AD  then yes

   From whowhere did the bible originate

From the original authors  We call them Matthew Mark Luke John Peter
Paul James and one other not identified

   How long is a piece of string 

As long as you make it

 
 Adda

  Yet I am still not a believer  Is god not concerned with my
  disposition  Why is it beneath him to provide me with the
  evidence I would require to believe  The evidence that my
  personality given to me by this god would find compelling

The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to 
But think about it for a minute  Would you rather have someone love
you because you made them love you or because they wanted to
love you     

  First I don't expect them to love me if they don't even know I
  exist  Secondly I wouldn't expect them to love me simply because
  they were my creator  I would expect to have to earn that love

The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward
Him  He promises to be there for you but you have to look for yourself

  Are you daft  How do I love something I don't believe exists
  Come back when you've learned to love your third testicle

Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort
Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you will see
that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic
Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  Yet some think it is
the ultimate  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
know more than you do now   To learn you must accept that which
you don't know

  At which point you have stepped over the line and become a
  complete asshole  Even though it's your first offense I won't
  let it slip becuase I've heard it too goddamned many times

  You love Jesus because deep in your heart you're a cannibalistic
  necrophiliac  Because I say so and I'm much more qualified to
  assess your motivations than you are

  Fortunately there are some things I get to accept on evidence
  rather than faith  One of them being that until christians like
  yourself quit being so fucking arrogant there will never be
  peace  You've all made sure of that

 summary of Jim's stuff

Jim I'm afraid you've missed the point

Thus I think you'll have to admit that  atheists have a lot
more up their sleeve than you might have suspected

Nah  I will encourage people to learn about atheism to see how little atheists
have up their sleeves  Whatever I might have suspected is actually quite
meager  If you want I'll send them your address to learn less about your
faith

Faith

Yeah do you expect people to read the FAQ etc and actually accept hard
atheism  No you need a little leap of faith Jimmy  Your logic runs out
of steam

Fine but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock
the idea of a God  

I hope you understand now

Yes Jim  I do understand now  Thank you for providing some healthy sarcasm
that would have dispelled any sympathies I would have had for your faith

Bake

Real glad you detected the sarcasm angle but am really bummin' that
I won't be getting any of your sympathy  Still if your inclined
to have sympathy for somebody's faith you might try one of the
religion newsgroups

Just be careful over there though make believe I'm
whispering in your ear here  They're all delusional

Jim

Sorry I can't pity you Jim  And I'm sorry that you have these feelings of
denial about the faith you need to get by  Oh well just pretend that it will
all end happily ever after anyway  Maybe if you start a new newsgroup
altatheisthard you won't be bummin' so much

Good job Jim

Hi

I don't know much about Mormons and I want to know about serious independent
studies about the Book of Mormon

I don't buy the 'official' story about the gold original taken to heaven
but haven't read the Book of Mormon by myself I have to much work learning
Biblical Hebrew I will appreciate any comment about the results of study
in style vocabulary placenames internal consistency and so on

For example There is evidence for onewriter or multiple writers
There are some mention about events places or historical persons later
discovered by archeologist

Yours in Collen

 Wait a minute  You said never play a Chamberlain  Since the US
 is playing Chamberlain as far as East Timor is concerned wouldn't
 that lead you to think that your argument is irrelevant and had nothing
 to do with the Gulf War  Actually I rather like your idea  Perhaps
 the rest of the world should have bombed or maybe missiled Washington
 when the US invaded Nicaragua Grenada Panama Vietnam Mexico Hawaii
 or any number of other places

Wait a minute Doug  I know you are better informed than that  The US 
has never invaded Nicaragua as far as I know  We liberated Grenada 
from the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion 
of a strategic air strip  Panama we invaded true twice this century  
Vietnam  We were invited in by the government of S Vietnam  I guess 
we invaded Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War eh  Mexico  We have 
invaded Mexico  or  times once this century but there were no missiles 
for anyone to shoot over here at that time  Hawaii  We liberated it from 
Spain

So if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where
we cross someone's border you are right  out of   But normally
invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation
If some nation invades the US Virgin Islands would they be
invading the Virgin Islands or the US  So from this point of
view your score falls to  out of  Mexico Panama


 
 What's a peacenik  Is that somebody who doesn't masturbate
 over Guns'n'Ammo or what  Is it supposed to be bad to be a peacenik

No it's someone who believes in peaceatallcosts  In other words
a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and
Czechoslakia but Poland too if it could have averted the War  And one
who would allow Hitler to wipe all all Jews slavs and political 
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone

Is it supposed to be bad to be a peacenik you ask  Well it depends
on what your values are  If you value life over liberty peace over
freedom then I guess not  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you
than life itself if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live
under a tyrant's heel then yes it's bad to be a peacenik

The problem with most peaceniks it they consider those of us who are
not like them to be bad and unconscionable  I would not have any
argument or problem with a peacenik if they held to their ideals and
stayed out of all conflicts or issues especially those dealing with 
the national defense  But no they are not willing to allow us to
legitimately hold a different pointofview  They militate and 
many times resort to violence all in the name of peace  What rank
hypocrisy  All to stop we warmongers who are willing to stand up 
and defend our freedoms against tyrants and who realize that to do
so requires a strong national defense

Time to get off the soapbox now

 I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of
 the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group
 of the population 

I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties
with Christianity It is surprising to note that a large majority of
people at least in Finland seem to be apatheists  even though
  of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland
religious people are actually a minority 

Could it be possible that many people believe in god just in case
It seems people do not want to seek the truth they fall prey to Pascal's
Wager or other poor arguments A small minority of those who do believe
reads the Bible regularly The majority doesn't care  it believes
but doesn't know what or how 

People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle
they only want to keep the virtual gate open A Christian would say
that they are not born in the Spirit but this does not disturb them
Religion is not something to think about 

I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible
dream Religions have a strong appeal to people nevertheless  
a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to
Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our
morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop too many
people take the poison with a smile Or just pretend to swallow
and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice  

 Also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a
 higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking  The
 typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the
 same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the
 other qualitatively  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn
 somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core
 than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it
 expresses its own selfishness

If logic and reason are valued then I would claim that atheistic thinking
is of higher value than the theistic exposition Theists make unnecessary
assumptions they believe in  I've yet to see good reasons to believe
in gods or to take a leap of faith at all A revelation would do

However why do we value logic and reasoning This questions bears
some resemblance to a longdisputed problem in science why mathematics
works Strong deep structuralists like Atkins have proposed that
perhaps after all everything is mathematics 

Is usefulness any criterion

Cobb writes

Am I making a wrong assumption for the basis of morals  Where do they come 
from  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from
whatever is societally mandated

It's only one aspect of morality  Societal morality is necessarily
very crude and broadbrush stuff which attempts to deal with what
is necessary to keep that society going   and often it's a little
overenthusiastic about doing so  Individual morality is a different
thing it often includes societal mores or society is in trouble
but is stronger  For example some people are vegetarian though eating
meat may be perfectly legal


Merely a question for the basis of morality

MoralEthical behavior  Societally acceptable behavior

Who is society

Depends on the society

Doesn't help  Is the point irrelevant

No  Often the answer is we are  But if society is those who make
the rules that's a different question  If society is who should
make the rules that's yet another  I don't claim to have the answers either
but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland and I like some things
about the US system at least in principle


How do they define what is acceptable

Depends
On  Again this comes from a certain question see above

Well ideally they don't but if they must they should do it by consensus IMO

How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position

By adopting a default position that people's moral decisions
are none of society's business

So how can we put people in jail How can we condemn other societies

Because sometimes that's necessary  The hard trick is to recognise when
it is and equally importantly when it isn't

 and only interfering when it's truly
necessary

Why would it be necessary  What right do we have to interfere

IMO it isn't often that interference ie jail and force of various
kinds and degrees is both necessary and effective  Where you derive 
the right to interfere is a difficult question  it's a sort of
liar's paradox force is necessary for freedom   One possible justification
is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if
their own freedom is taken away  the paradox doesn't arise if
we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom

  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem
that it can be either too much or too little  but most people seem
to agree that some level of interference is necessary

They see the need for a justice system  How can we even define that term

Only by consensus I guess

  Thus you
get a situation where The law often allows what honour forbids which I've
come to believe is as it should be  

I admit I don't understand that statement

What I mean is that while thusandsuch may be legal thusandsuch may
also be seen as immoral   The law lets you do it but you don't let yourself
do it  Eating meat for example

Just borrowing your post Mr Rice

In ppsilinkcom Robert Knowles ppsilinkcom writes
Are you sure that democracy is the driving force behind
the massacres in East Timor  It is certainly odd that so many of the worlds
massacres occur along religious lines independently of any claims to a
democratic form of government  Are Ireland and Northern Ireland considered
democracies  Would you attribute their problems to democracy even though
they are democracies  Which motivates them more religion or democracy

Mr Rice was pointing out a fallacy in the assertion that Islam is evil
because some of those who claim to follow it are evil not asserting that 
democracy causes massacres as I read it  

That is right he was  And I was pointing out that his use of Indonesians
killing the East Timorese as a result of democracy was a bit weak because
democracy is not much of a motivation for doing much of anything in Indonesia
from what I remember  East Timor was a former Portguese territory which was
forcibly annexed by Indonesia  Last I heard over  Indonesians have
died trying to keep East Timor a part of Indonesia  Being a former 
Portuguese colony there is a strong Catholic influence in East Timor as I
recall  So it seems a bit odd that yet again we have another war being
fought between people who just happen to have different religions  Purely
coincidental I guess  But then the real motivation is to get the vote out
and make democracy work in Indonesia

I pointed out the secession movement in Aceh which has also been
brutally dealt with in the past by the Indonesian government  The
harshly with all secessionist movements
the evidence it appears to me that the Indonesian government has dealt
very harshly with all secession movements

I know that the head of the Indonesian armed forces for a very long time
was Benny Murdani  a Christian  Indonesia has been heavy handed in
East Timor for a long time  even when Murdani was head of the armed
forces  The people who make up the
Indonesian government are in general motivated by national interests
not religious ones

I'm actually not trying to make a point  I'm just trying to find out the
coherence of the societally based morality position  Is my assumption of
societally based morals wrong  

No but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to get
to a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful
The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a major
defining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now and
is the part of both disciplines as social psychology that strikes me
as most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on the
net

An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of social norms in
action is the micro sociology of Ervin Goffman  There are some very
good introductory essays Deference and Demeanor is a classic as
well as accessible books like Interaction Ritual  More difficult and
theoretical are some of his later books like Frame Analysis  But even
at his most academic Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavily
jargonladen theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable

Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims in
the setting of their expectations of other people and others' expectations
of them  This becomes systematized in a socially mandated way simply
because otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonal
realtions with every single interaction  and we engage in social inter
actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day so that a renego
tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion
We simply learn it most of it early along with language which is one
of the main exemplars

 Yes  Fortunately we have rightthinking folks like your good self in power
 and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds o
 thousands of Iraqis in order to liberate oilHHHKuwait  We won the war
 hurrah hurrah
 
 The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and 
 exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media  The
 facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians 
 in any other war of comparable size this century
 
 Let's analyze this claim a little  How is the size of a war defined  By
 number of participants  Geographical area  Number of countries involved 
 Number of casualties

Size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a
percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries
too are all measures of size  In this case I'd say the relevant
statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to
total casualties from among the total civilian population in the
affected geographical area

 
 Which other comparable wars are we talking about

Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons

 
 Which liberal news media are we talking about
 

Western news in general but in particular the American mass media
CBS NBC ABC etc  The general tone of the news during the whole
war was one of those poor poor Iraqis along with look how precisely
this cruise missile blew this building to bits

                                                    This was due mostly
 to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques
 which were technically possible only recently
 
 I suspect that medical advances may have something to do with it too

I agree

 
 How about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in WW
 I don't hear you bemoaning them
 
 Perhaps because the topic hasn't cropped up  If you want my opinion I think
 that the blanket bombing of German cities at the end of World War Two was the
 most appalling act of wholesale slaughter this country has committed in
 centuries  Bomber Harris was no hero of mine

Perhaps so  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too  But that's easy
to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the 's right  Back
then it was allout war and Germany and Japan had to be squashed
After all a million or more British had already died hundreds of 
thousands of French a couple hundread thousand or so Americans and 
millions of Russians not to mention a few million Jews Poles and 
other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps  All 
things considered the firebombings and the atomic bomb were
essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick
end to avoid even greater allied losses

I for one don't regret it

 
                                 War is never an exact science but
 with smart bombs it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage
 of civilian casualties  Sometimes mistakes are made targets are
 misidentified innocents die  That's war the way it really is
 
 Entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests without
 regard for the lives of other people that is the way war really is

Sure  And it's the people who suffer because of them  All the more
reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their
own selfish interests  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies
as well

 
 Why all the fuss about Kuwait and not East Timor Bosnia or even Tibet  If
 Iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before
 we started bombing

I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the
West before the war  It is evident that the West especially America
misjudged Hussein drastically  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and 
threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's
oil supply he had to be stopped  Sure the war could have been
prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West
before Hussein invaded Kuwait but it is still Hussein who is
responsible for his decision to invade  And once he did so a
strong response from the West was required

 
 Mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase here
 You come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although I
 feel sure that was not your intent
 
 What's your intent  To sound like a Loving Christian  Well you aren't
 doing a very good job of it

Well it's not very loving to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up
nearby countries and keep them  Or to allow them to continue with mass
slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion  So I'd have to
say yes stopping Hussein was the most loving thing to do for the
most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest
 
 So the Iraqi war was wrong eh  I'm sure that appeasement would have
 worked better than war just like it did in WW eh
 
 Who even mentioned appeasement  And what makes you think the situation is
 even remotely analogous to World War Two

I mentioned it

If we hadn't intervened allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would
have been appeasement  It is precisely the lessons the world learned
in WW that motivated the Western alliance to war  Letting Hitler take
Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW from happening and letting
Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to
protect Saudi Arabia

 
                                                           I guess we
 shouldn't have fought WW either  just think of all those innocent
 German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg
 
 Yes do  Germans are human too you know
 

Sure  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in
his grandiose quest for a Thousand Year Reich  The consequences
stemmed from that

 Tyrants like Hussein have to be stopped  His kind don't understand
 diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun  My only regret is
 that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad so
 now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice not to
 mention the  Americans who died was for naught
 
 I look forward to hearing your incisive comments about East Timor and Tibet
 
What should I say about them  Anything in particular


 And as for poor poor Rodney King  Did you ever stop and think why
 the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty

 people in that jury

So  It was the policemen on trial not Rodney King  And under American
law they deserved a jury of their peers  If there had been black
officers involved I'm sure their would have been black jurors too
This point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow

 
 Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those
 policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape
 But the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and I
 have not seen
 
 When I see a bunch of policemen beating someone who's lying defenceless on
 the ground it's rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have
 been

So  It's hard to imagine  So when has Argument from Incredulity
gained acceptance from the revered author of Constructing a Logical
Argument  Can we expect another revision soon    Just kidding

 
 If there is some wonderful evidence why is it seemingly being kept secret 
 Why not tell everyone what it is  Then everyone could say Oh yes you're
 right King deserved a good beating and we could all live happily ever
 after

I have to admit that I wonder this too  But neither the prosecution
nor the defense is talking  So one cannot conclude either way due to
the silence of the principals  

 
 Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused
 whether they be criminals or cops  One is not found guilty if there is
 a reasonable doubt of one's guilt and only the jury is in a position
 to assess the evidence and render a verdict
 
 Fine but I'm still finding it hard to imagine what the reasonable doubt
 was in this case  I mean the cops certainly seem to be beating someone
 who's lying defenceless on the ground  What's your explanation  Mass
 hallucination  Orbital mindcontrol lasers  Faked video footage  Do tell
 

OK  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved
And frankly the original not guilty verdict baffled me too  But then
I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict
on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably
would have won they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated
assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm  A charge which
news commentators said was akin to attempted murder under California
law  Based on what the prosecution was asking for it's evident that 
the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty  Note 
not not guilty of doing wrong but not guilty of aggravated assault 
with the intent of inflicting serious bodily harm  The seeds of the 
prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a 
verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could

If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then
I feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one

Theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes Irrational
belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism

Correlation is not causation   And a belief that absolutes exist is not
the same thing as a belief in absolutes any more than belief in a shortest
route from Thurles to Clonmel is the same thing as a knowledge of the
Irish roadsystem

Correlation is not necessarily causation However as you might have noticed
the above allows to conclude that the correlation between religion and fanatism
is based on common features of religious belief
 
Sorry for the long quotes but I dont see where to cut
 
 
Huh   Are you barking mad

 
Hardly
 
 
 Theism is not as strongly correlated with fanaticism as you say  PLUS
    you could find stronger correlations if you were actually interested
    in the truth instead of being as you seeming are a bigot

 
Theism is correlated with fanaticism I have neither said that all fanatism
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism The point is
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic One could of course
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but I just
have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it

IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your 
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered  Gullibility 
blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more 
reliable indicators  And the really dangerous people  the sources of
fanaticism  are often none of these things  They are cynical manipulators
of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing  Now some
brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism
I grant you  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned
argument  and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom  Ever read Animal Farm

  Define irrational belief  eg is it rational to believe that
     reason is always useful

 
Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason The latter has
been discussed for a long time with Charley Wingate One point is that
the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information

Well there is a glaring paradox here  an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would
be irrational  Which is it

The first part of the second statement contains no information because
you don't say what the beliefs are  If the beliefs are strong theism 
andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true  The
second part of your sentence is patently false  counterexample an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it

Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational

I can't agree with this until you are specific  which theism  To
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
I suspect you do not have

The affinity to fanatism is easily seen It has to be true because I believe
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis However the beliefs say they are
more than a work hypothesis

I don't understand this  Can you formalise your argument

 Now what I am interested in is the original notion you were discussing
 on moral free agency  That is how can a god punish a person for
 not believing in him when that person is only following his or her
 nature and it is not possible for that person to deny what his or
 her reason tells him or her which is that there is no god

I think you're letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of

WEBSTER  myth  a traditional or legendary story
           a beliefwhose truth is accepted uncritically

How does that qualify
Indeed it's almost oxymoronica rather amusing instance
I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheistviews as
accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend
Many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but
they don't meet the other criterions
Also

Divine justice According to the most fundamental doctrines of
Christianity When the first man sinned he was at that time the

You accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to
launch your own xtian mythology  This time meeting all the
requirements of myth

salvation The idea of punishment is based on the proposition that
everyone knows instinctively that God exists is their creator and

Ah but not everyone knows that god exists  So you have
a fallacy

There's nothing terribly difficult in all this and is well known to
any reasonably Biblically literate Christian The only controversy is

And that makes it true  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy
Read the FAQ  If you've read it you missed something so reread
Not a bad suggestion for anyoneI reread it just before this

with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it
means When atheists claim that they do not know if God exists and
don't know what He wants they contradict the Bible which clearly says
that everyone knows The authority of the Bible is its claim to be

should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting
it across  You may trust the Bible but your trusting it doesn't
make it any more credible to me

If the Bible says that everyone knows that's clearly reason
to doubt the Bible because not everyone knows your alleged
god's alleged existance

refuted while the specieswide condemnation is justified Those that
claim that there is no evidence for the existence of God or that His will is
unknown must deliberately ignore the Bible the ignorance itself is
no excuse

 No they don't have to ignore the Bible  The Bible is far
from universally accepted  The Bible is NOT a proof of god
it is only a proof that some people have thought that there
was a god  Or does it prove even that  They might have been
writing it as series of fiction shortstories  As in the
case of Dionetics  Assuming the writers believed it the
only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it
And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the
interpretations and Biblicalphilosophers were correct

 There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible

 Again read the FAQ

freedom You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to
ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known
in both cases That an atheist can't accept the evidence means only

Bzztwrong answer
Gravity is directly THERE  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and
rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it  God on the
other hand doesn't generally show up in the supermarket except
on the tabloids  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence
Gravity is obvious gods aren't

Secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of God so
much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature Human reason
always comes back to the question of God in every generation and in

No human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of
God it has usually come back to the existance of god
In other words it doesn't generally come back to the xtian
god it comes back to whether there is any god  And in much
of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn't pop up as
the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces
are and which ones are out there  From a worldwide view
human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to
be andor what forces are currently in control  A natural
tendancy to believe in God only exists in religious wishful
thinking

I said all this to make the point that Christianity is eminently
reasonable that Divine justice is just and human nature is much
different than what atheists think it is Whether you agree or not

Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions and
it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence
Divine justicewell it only seems just to those who already
believe in the divinity
First not all atheists believe the same things about human
nature Second whether most atheists are correct or not
YOU certainly are not correct on human nature  You are at
the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric
approach  Try looking at the outside world as well when
you attempt to sum up all of humanity

 I think you misunderstand  Suppose you have a couple of gas atoms in a
 container  If you ionise one of them you generally assume that the other is
 not affected  This is only true to a certain degree of accuracy luckily
 there are all sorts of effects we can ignore when doing chemistry  Like
 gravitational forces for example because they're very weak

Agreed But your original posting seemed to me to be just another 
Heisenbergian misunderstanding of what chemists do  Heisenberg
said biologists are treating atoms just like they were solid balls
This is what some chemists used to do too but this is not how
chemistry is taught today
 
 And I agree  I think you merely misunderstood the point I was trying to
 make which is that we simplify the real situation to something we can deal
 with  For instance we talk about electron pairs and draw diagrams of
 molecules with little markings to show these pairs of electrons  This is
 actually nonsense but it's a perfectly good model for predicting all kinds
 of chemical reactions

Your original posting shows that you seem to think chemists still think
this way It is true that basic chemistry is still taught in terms of
electron pairs and valences but this is not what chemists are taught 
and this is not how they should think 

I suggest you take a look at PW Atkins's classic text Physical Chemistry
th ed Oxford University Press  to see how chemistry is taught today

However I still agree with your point  concepts must be allowed to
operate at a pragmatic level In chemistry this usually means we must use
different models for different situations It is unfair to say that
chemists simply ignore effects they can't deal with  on the contrary
they are quite concerned with the limitations of their models 
 
 I remember thinking the first time I saw the shapes of the electron
 orbitals They have got to be kidding

If someone insists that electron is confined inside these shapes
it would indeed constitute a joke The shapes are still important 
even though they are only visual representations of the radial and
angular functions The surfaces are arbitrary and not really important  
what is more important in chemistry are the signs of the wavefunctions

Is there something wrong with the representations

In article qlmdINNgapcaltechedu keithccocaltechedu Keith Allan Schneider writes

This whole thread started because of a discussion about whether
or not the death penalty constituted cruel punishment which is forbidden
by the US Constitution
Yes but they didn't say what they meant by cruel which is why
a you have the Supreme Court and b it makes no sense to refer
to the Constitution which is quite silent on the meaning of the
word cruel

They spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the Constitution  They
picked words whose meanings implied the intent  We have already looked
in the dictionary to define the word  Isn't this sufficient

	We only need to ask the question what did the founding fathers 
consider cruel and unusual punishment

	Hanging Hanging there slowing being strangled would be very 
painful both physically and psychologicall I imagine

	Firing squad   note not a clean way to die back in those 
days  etc 

	All would be considered cruel under your definition
	All were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers

 As evidence for the Resurrection it is often claimed that the Disciples
were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce
their claim that Jesus had come back from the dead
 Now I skimmed Acts and such and I found a reference to this happening
to Stephen but no others Where does this apparently very widely held
belief come from Is there any evidence outside the Bible Is there any
evidence in the Bible I sure haven't found any

het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism
 
Straw man you are trying to replace pragmatics by morals And what about
a Subjectivis saying Subjectivismis better for me
 
 
Is good logic better than bad  Is good science better than bad   Ought
I to prefer simple theories with accurate predictions to complex and useless
theories   Is almost anything preferable to genocide Is there a sense in
which such value judgements are objective or not

 
Make those predictions and don't waste our time with circular definitions
and assertions without evidence In this example when genocide is so
commonly abhorred why does it happen so often in the context of religion
Does it allow to conclude that there is something about religion that
catalyses genocide Or in case it has nothing got to do with religion
that the premise is wrong genocide is not abhorred

Merely a question for the basis of morality

MoralEthical behavior  Societally acceptable behavior

I disagree with these  What society thinks should be irrelevant  What the
individual decides is all that is important

This doesn't seem right  If I want to kill you I can because that is what I
decide

Who is society

I think this is fairly obvious

Not really  If whatever a particular society mandates as ok is ok there are
always some in the society who disagree with the mandates so which 
societal mandates make the standard for morality
 
How do they define what is acceptable

Generally by what they feel is right which is the most idiotic policy I can
think of

So what should be the basis Unfortunately I have to admit to being tied at 
least loosely to the feeling in that I think we intuitively know some things
to be wrong  Awfully hard to defend though

How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position

By thinking for ourselves

I might agree here  Just because certain actions are legal does not make them
moral

I guess I'm delving into a religious language area  What exactly is morality 
or morals  I never thought of eating meat to be moral or immoral but I think
it could be  How do we differentiate between not doing something because it is
a personal choice or preference and not doing something because we see it as 
immoral  Do we fall to what the basis of these morals are

Also consensus positions fall to a might makes right  Or as you brought out
if whatever is right is what is societally mandated then whoever is in control
at the time makes what is right

	Wouldn't it be nice if Subject lines had something to do
with nessage bodies

Yes

	I wonder if the Universe would look like a Black Hole
from outside How could we posit an Outside whether called
DeSitter space hyperspace parallel universes whatever

I don't think that the universe would look like a black hole from
the outside because that would imply that similar to a black hole we
would see stuff coming in from the outside

	Suppose that such a space existed and that our universe
looked like a Black Hole in it Then our Universe could be open
to it through Hawking radiation the same way Black Holes are
within our Universe Note this is all the purist speculation
and noone knows what laws govern QM beyond the event horizon
of our universe Can laws change at such boundaries of spacetime

I am personally convinced that what we call our universe is only a
small part of a larger system Further I think that it is logically 
necessary for the laws of our universe be confined to this universe
itself

Why do I believe this It is simple I believe that the odds against
there being only one universe and that universe having the right conditions
to support us are infinate I believe that to explain our existance in
this universe it is necessary to either consider multiple universes
an infinate number of them or intelligent design Since the only
intelligence that we know of is of a higher order than simple matter
the brain is made of matter by Ockham's razor I go for the first
choice

What's more there are a couple of books out dealing with popular
science that use parallel universes and holographic universes which
is another way of saying parallel to explain the behavior of particals
at the quantum level One is called Parallel Universes and I think it
is by Wolf the other The Holographic Universe

BTW the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in the
very physical reality of the universe

If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that What
right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally
mandated morality  Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your
brother and say that I was exercising my rights as I saw them was
doing what felt good didn't want anyone forcing their morality on me
or I don't follow your morality 
 
I believe that morality is subjective  Each person is entitled to his
own moral attitudes  Mine are not a priori more correct than someone
elses  This does not mean however that I must judge another on the
basis of his rather than my moral standards  While he is entitled to
believe what his own moral sense tells him the rest of society is
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is
offensive to the majority

Why How Might makes right How can they force their morality on me Why 
can't I do what I want Who are they to decide What if I disagree 
 
Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral  The may realize that
it is immoral and not care  They are thus not following their own moral
system but being immoral

Good point but it is being immoral in our opinion  We don't let them choose
we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them

  For someone to lay claim to an alternative
moral system he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be
internally consistent  Some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense

I admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense but have little basis
for it as of yet  How far can such a concept be extended

 and
thus may be incapable of behaving morally  While someone like Hitler
may have believed that his actions were moral we may judge him immoral
by our standards

Do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but 
not him  After all he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he
chose  On what basis do we condemn other societies besides here's the buzz 
words on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all 
societies

  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean
that we must excuse the murderer

Why not Do we have to be objective suddenly

  Now what I am interested in is the original notion you were discussing

 I think you're letting atheist mythology

Great start  I realize immediately that you are not interested
in discussion and are going to thump your babble at me  I would
much prefer an answer from Ms Healy who seems to have a
reasonable and reasoned approach to things  Say aren't you the
creationist guy who made a lot of silly statements about
evolution some time ago

 confuse you on the issue of
 Divine justice According to the most fundamental doctrines of
 Christianity When the first man sinned he was at that time the
 entire human race and any punishment meted out would necessarily
 affect the entire race of which he was the sole representiveAll
 humans coming after him would being of the same race species share
 in that judgement It has nothing to do with who deserves what
 From the perspective of God humanity is but one category of created
 things and that category is condemned 

Duh gee then we must be talking Christian mythology now  I
was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable logical
person but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition
of the same boring mythology I've seen a thousand times before
I am deleting the rest of your remarks unless I spot something
that approaches an answer because they are merely a repetition
of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought
at all



I have to congratulate you though Bill  You wouldn't
know a logical argument if it bit you on the balls  Such
a persistent lack of function in the face of repeated
attempts to assist you in learning which I have seen
in this forum and others in the past speaks of a talent
that goes well beyond my own meager abilities  I just don't

 Which liberal news media are we talking about
 
 Western news in general but in particular the American mass media
 CBS NBC ABC etc  The general tone of the news during the whole
 war was one of those poor poor Iraqis along with look how precisely
 this cruise missile blew this building to bits
 
 Most odd  Over here there was very little about the suffering of the Iraqi
 civilians until towards the end of the war and then it was confined to the
 few remaining quality newspapers

True  At first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos
the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from
the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets  But later and especially
after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone  It
seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war
that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare  It's like
they were only proGulfWar as long as it was nice and clean smart
missiles dropping in on military HQs but not when pictures of dead
dying and maimed civilians started cropping up  What naive hypocrites

 
 How about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in WW
 I don't hear you bemoaning them

 discussion about blanketbombing and Abombs deleted
 
 All things considered the firebombings and the atomic bomb were
 essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick
                            
 end to avoid even greater allied losses

I should have said here militarily justified  It seems from your
comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified
I apologize

 
 What about the evidence that America knew Japan was about to surrender after
 Hiroshima but before Nagasaki  Is that another lie peddled by the liberal
 media conspiracy

I have often wondered about this  I've always thought that the first bomb
should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk  A good
inpenatrable military target  The second bomb could've been held back
for use on an industrial center if need be  But I digress

Yes I have heard that we found evidence after the war BTW that Japan
was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb  Unfortunately
the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's
ulimatum  Therefore the second bomb was dropped  Most unfortunate IMO

 
 I for one don't regret it
 
 Nuke a Jap for Jesus
 

I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made
which affect the lives of innocent people  But I do regret the 
circumstances which make those decisions necessary and I regret the
suffering caused by those decisions  



 Why all the fuss about Kuwait and not East Timor Bosnia or even Tibet
 If Iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks
 before we started bombing
 
 I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the
 West before the war  It is evident that the West especially America
 misjudged Hussein drastically  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and 
 threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's
 oil supply he had to be stopped
 
 Oh I see  So we can overlook his using chemical weapons on thousands of
 people but if he threatens your right to drive a huge gasguzzling car
 well the man's gotta go

Actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US
and allied action  If some backwater country took over some other
backwater country we probably wouldn't intervene  Not that we don't
care but we can't be the world's policman  Or if a coup had occured
in Kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldn't have acted
because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to
Saudi Arabia  But the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion
by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil 
interests caused us to take action

 
  I've moved a paragraph from here to later on 
 


 
 If we hadn't intervened allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would
 have been appeasement
 
 Right  But did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action  Or
 are you just setting up a strawman
 

I'm not setting up a strawman at all  If you want to argue against the
war then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep
Kuwait  Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective

                                                           I guess we
 shouldn't have fought WW either  just think of all those innocent
 German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg
 
 Yes do  Germans are human too you know
 
 Sure  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in
 his grandiose quest for a Thousand Year Reich  The consequences
 stemmed from that
 
 Translation They were asking for it
 
Well in a sense yes  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler
would lead their nation to

 But what about those who didn't support Hitler's dreams of conquest  It's
 not as if they democratically voted for all his policies  The NSDAP got 
 in the elections of  and that was the last chance the German people got
 to vote on the matter

They suffered along with the rest  Why does this bother you so much
The world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect  Many
innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others  It it regretable
but that's TheWayItIs  There are no perfect solutions


 
 I look forward to hearing your incisive comments about East Timor and
 Tibet

 What should I say about them  Anything in particular
 
 The people of East Timor are still being killed by a dictatorship that
 invaded their country  Hell even Western journalists have been killed  All
 this was happening before the Gulf War  Why didn't we send in the bombers to
 East Timor  Why aren't we sending in the bombers NOW

Probably because we're not the saviors of the world  We can't police each
and every country that decides to selfdestruct or invade another  Nor
are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet East Timor or
some other places
 
  Here's that paragraph I moved 
 
 What's your intent  To sound like a Loving Christian  Well you aren't
 doing a very good job of it
 
 Well it's not very loving to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up
 nearby countries and keep them  Or to allow them to continue with mass
 slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion  So I'd have to
 say yes stopping Hussein was the most loving thing to do for the
 most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest
 
 The Chinese government has a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization
 of Tibetans  Tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed  Amnesty
 International recently reported that torture is still widespread in China
 
 Why aren't we stopping them  In fact why are we actively sucking up to them
 by trading freely with them

Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it  I for one do not
agree with the present US policy of sucking up to them as you put it
I agree that it is deplorable

 
 And as for poor poor Rodney King  Did you ever stop and think why
 the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty
 
 Yes  Amongst the things I thought were Hmm there's an awful lot of white
 people in that jury
 
 So  It was the policemen on trial not Rodney King
 
 Erm surely it's irrelevant who's on trial  Juries are supposed to represent
 a crosssection of the population

Are they  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale
where the trial is held  Normally this is where the crime is committed
unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue
is in order  I'm not an expert on California law or even US law but
it seems that this is the way the system is set up  You can criticize
the system but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial 
prejudice thrown around

 
 And under American law they deserved a jury of their peers
 
 You are saying that black people are not the peers of white people

No not at all  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks
on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant

 
 This point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow
 
 This idea of people only being tried before a jury of people just like them
 is really stupid  Should the Nuremburg trials have had a jury entirely made
 up of Nazis

Germans perhaps  Peers doesn't mean those who do the same thing
like having murderers judge murderers  It means having people from
the same station in life presumably because they are in a better
position to understand the defendent's motivations

 
 Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those
 policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape
 But the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and I
 have not seen
 
 When I see a bunch of policemen beating someone who's lying defenceless on
 the ground it's rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have
 been
 
 So  It's hard to imagine  So when has Argument from Incredulity
 gained acceptance from the revered author of Constructing a Logical
 Argument
 
 We're not talking about a logical argument  We're talking about a court of
 law  As the FAQ points out some fallacious arguments are not viewed as
 fallacies in a court of law

OK granted  However you are using this reasoning as part of your
logical argument in this discussion  This is not a court of law

 
 If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then
 I feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one
 
 Were you not talking earlier about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy
 
The media is not totally monolithic  Even though there is a prevailing
liberal bias programs such as the MacNeilLehrer News Hour try to give
a balanced and fair reporting of the news  There are even conservative
sources out there if you know where to look  Hurrah for Rush

BTW I never used the word conspiracy  I don't accept without far
more evidence theories that there is some allpervading liberal
conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources

 Thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing
  in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way
  as unfortunately it cannot be helped
                                   Jim Brown Bible for Loving Christians
 
 Thanks mathew I like the quote  Pretty funny actually  I'm a 
 Monty Python fan you know  Kind of seems in that vein
 
 Of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem
 contradictory  But then you know that already
 
 Ha ha only serious
 
 I an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people
 
 You a supposed Christian are arguing that it's OK to kill innocent people
 so long as you get some guilty ones as well

Hardly  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing tm to kill innocent people
if the end is just  Unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world and
there are no perfect solutions  If one is going to  resist tyranny then
innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die  I didn't say
it is OK  it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary

 
 I a moral relativist am arguing that saturation bombing of German cities at
 the end of World War II was as far as I can see an evil and unnecessary act

I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain
and suffering  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say  That
conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved
And perhaps it was unnecessary as let's say we now know  That doesn't
mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as
being necessary  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of
an action before making a decision  At the time it may have seemed
necessary enough to go ahead with it

But don't assume that I feel the bombing was morally justified  I
don't  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult
decision under difficult circumstances

 
 You having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that I am
 in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the
 War  

You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist
I as an absolutist am in a position to judge but I defer judgment

 You are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular
 context of the time and that they might have been moral then but not moral
 now

Wrong  They were neither moral then nor now  They seemed necessary to
those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war  I simply
refuse to condemn them for their decision
 
 Where's your Christian love  Where's your absolute morality  Oh how quick
 you are to discard them when it suits you  As Ivan Stang would say Jesus
 would puke

One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action
even this discourse in this forum  I understand the full ramifications of
that and I am prepared to do so  I don't believe that you can make the
same claim

 
 mathew

And BTW the reason I brought up the blanketbombing in Germany was
because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being 
so deplorable  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
wasn't accurate enough to hit industrialmilitary targets in a
decisive way by any other method at that time  But in the Gulf War
precision bombing was the norm  So the point was why make a big
stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted
in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians
proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing
in WW  Even with precision bombing mistakes happen and some
civilians suffer  But less civilians suffered in this war than
any other iany other in history  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives
with minimal interference from the allied air raids  The stories
of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk
Yes bunk  The US lost  servicemen in WW over four years
and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting  But 
we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of 
civilian Iraqis died in a war lasting about  months  And with 
the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that  
What hogwash  If hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians died 
it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people not due to 
the Allied bombing

My last response in this thread fell into a bitbucket and vanished
though appearing locally  I'll repost it since I always feel
slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a
conversational thread I don't want Rob to think I'm doing so  Since
this is now dated however don't feel compelled to respond

In article Aprwatsonibmcom stromWatsonIbmCom Rob Strom writes
I was making two separate points both of which attack
face value Bible interpretation

 To judge the Bible's value today you judge it based on
    the way it is used today  That is what do commentators
    actually say what do rabbis teach etc

I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have
been referring to one problem with a highlyinterpreted tradition
like this is what happens when a schism occurs and over time certain
large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor
exactly a face value interpretation

 To judge the Bible's value when originally written
    you a read it in the context of its time not
    with today's assumptions and b compare it to
    the practices of surrounding people

While the context of the time is important value judgments must
ultimately be according to current understanding or at least to some
base standard relative stabilitysuccess of a society eg  This
is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people
for instance according to the Bible the surrounding people were
immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits  We need to look
rather at what those peoples were really like  For instance in
what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is
symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of
whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue  By the
Bible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil but I see no evidence
that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time
were particularly bad people relative to the people in the Bible

scissors and cloth Now in the past our ancestors
did cut cloth with scissors but they at least knew that
their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth
so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from
their earlier barbarism and made the transition to
modern civilized papercutting that much easier

Sounds good but it presupposes teethrending neighbors which I see
no support for  One can argue that postfacto assertion of inhumane
neighbors can be used to make moral points but that doesn't mean that
the actual neighbors really were inhuman  More to the point such
dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain or
even of a different people dwelling among us is all too common

 That complex
 and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic
 interpretations of that history is interesting but I still don't
 think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it
 to attack condemnation of the original history

Note that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here for instance
claiming that Hammurabi's an eye for an eye was primitive brutal
retribution while Moses' version was an enlightened benign fine
because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way  As
of  years ago or so they probably both meant the same thing

To be sure I'm arguing from a parochial perspective
I belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against
overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe
and this book is the book of my tribe  The book commands
us to dedicate ourselves to study to improve the
world and to set an example as a light to the nations

We've revered the book and I think we've been successful
as scientists as artists and musicians as leaders
in important humanitarian causes  It's hard for me to
separate the success of my people from the virtue
of our book  You'd have to argue that we'd have
done significantly better with a different book or with no book
or that another tribe with a different book or
with no book has done significantly better

I don't belittle the accomplishments particularly the intellectual
ones of the Jewish people  I have given up on trying to think by
analogy since I don't know of any other 'tribe' that is at all
similar the closest I can think of are the Romany but I don't know
enough about them to make a meaningful comparison  I think a
tradition of reflective study of flexible rather than dogmatic
interpretation is a good thing  I think that with such an attitude a
case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a
 Captain America comic or whatever the Babylonian equivalent
would have been

Once again this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling
between some software cracks

In article buedu jaegerbuphybuedu Gregg Jaeger writes
As promised here is Rafiq Zakaria's discussion of the nature of
the socalled satanic verses from which Rushdie's title has been
taken Rafiq Zakaria Muhammad and the Quran Penguin '

Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident and an
 apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn't actually
 have happened  The historicity of the episode doesn't matter to what
 follows

I don't know whether I'm quoting Gregg or Zakaria below  Anyway back
to current affairs

Rushdie has by his own admission drawn
on the version given by the orientalist Watt 

Among others this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone
else dug up from nowhere it is a well known story a myth if you
will known according to Umar Khan to Every Muslim school boy and
girl and so presumably to Rushdie and to Gibreel Farishta

and then allowed his
imagination to run wild 

Yes this is what writing fiction is all about  Rushdie was writing
about a crisis of faith and chose this myth to present it by placing
the actor Gibreel in the role of the angel whose name he took
Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book and nowhere claims
or implies that this is what actually happened  It's somewhat like
stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed
prostitute Mary Magdalene another myth  Or those referring to the
Arthurian mythos or the Grail legend or the Wandering Jew or dozens
of others  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer
consider Salman Rushdie's children's book Haroun and the Sea of
Stories for an idea of the way a storyteller  a specific
storyteller  works with existing story lines

to ridicule Muhammad's integrity

No  Muhammad's Mahound's integrity is not really impugned in this
part of the story and there's no reason to think this was Rushdie's
intent Gibreel as the archangel produces the verses divine and
satanic though he doesn't know their provenance  It is not implied
in a straight reading that Muhammad influences them

     Not my voice I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker
    never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a Voice
      Mahound's eyes open wide he's seeing some kind of vision
    staring at it oh that's right Gibreel remembers me  He's
    seeing me  My lips moving being moved by  What whom  Don't
    know can't say  Nevertheless here they are coming out of my
    mouth up my throat past my teeth the Words
      Being God's postman is no fun yaar
      Butbutbut God isn't in this picture
      God knows whose postman I've been

It's ambiguous is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel  Is it Satan
Or something else  The answer is not given

To be sure the question is raised  This novel explores faith and the
role of revelation in religion among other things  Addressing loss
of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation
but this novel proposes no answers at least not directly  The very
existence of a newsgroup named altatheism raises the same
questions more forcefully and does propose some answers which is
the real relevance  If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is filth
and lies and he asked for what he got are we next on the fatwa
list  That's a rhetorical question of course

Another article that fell between the cracks

In article qiuINNpqsrvrenginumichedu inglesenginumichedu Ray Ingles writes
 As evidence for the Resurrection it is often claimed that the Disciples
were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce
their claim that Jesus had come back from the dead
 Now I skimmed Acts and such and I found a reference to this happening
to Stephen but no others Where does this apparently very widely held
belief come from Is there any evidence outside the Bible Is there any
evidence in the Bible I sure haven't found any

Briefly no  There is widespread folklore but no good documentary
evidence or even solid rumor concerning the deaths of the Apostles
Further the usual context of such arguments as you observe is No
Martyrs for a Lie ie the willingness of these people to die rather
than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief  This adds the
quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered
the chance of life by recanting  Since we don't even know how or
where they died we certainly don't have this information  By the
way even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could
have saved himself by recanting  The willingness of true believers
to die for their belief be it in Jesus or Jim Jones is
welldocumented so martyrdom in and of itself says little  See
Kings for a Biblical account of the martyrdom of  priests
of Baal

Another one rescued from the bit bucket

Over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on aa and
elsewhere on the net  Generally the discussion comes down to the
contention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against
Islam as to merit if not death than at least banning and probably
some sort of punishment and on the other that Rushdie particularly
as a nonmuslim in a Western country had every right to write and
publish whatever he chose regardless of whether some muslims find it
offensive without fear of persecution or death  

I am naturally inclined to the latter position but find myself in an
interesting position because I think this is a fine book only
incidentally concerned with Islam and moreover I'm damned if I can
find anything malevolently offensive in it

Over the years when I have made this point various primarily muslim
posters have responded saying that yes indeed they have read the book
and had called it such things as filth and lies I would rank
Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse and so on
Unfortunately these comments are usually generalities and attempts
to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so
offensive have met either with stony silence more generalizations or
inaccurate or outofcontext references to the book which lead me to
believe that few of them have actually read it  Corrections and
attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored

Anyway since I seem to be the only one following this particular line
of discussion I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have
read this book  What are your thoughts on it

This response originally fell into a bit bucket  I'm reposting it
just so Bill doesn't think I'm ignoring him

In article CwpvJxDdarksideosrheuoknoredu bilokcforumosrheedu Bill Conner writes
Jim Perry perrydsinccom wrote

Some stuff about Biblical morality though Bill's quote of me had little
 to do with what he goes on to say

Bill

I'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to
this

Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism I think
many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ  Your generalisms
are then misplaced  atheism needn't imply materialism or the lack
of an absolute moral system  However I do tend to materialism and
don't believe in absolute morality so I'll answer your questions

How then can an atheist judge value 

An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does according
to a personal understanding of morality  That I don't believe in an
absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one  I'm just explicit
as in the line of postings you followed up that when I express
judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code
rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad
My moral code is not particular different from that of others around
me be they Christians Muslims or atheists  So when I say that I
object to genocide I'm not expressing anything particularly out of
line with what my society holds

If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it
does my answer would be mechanistic to your taste  that a moral
code is a prerequisite for a functioning society and that humanity
probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of
our ability to exist in large societies thereby achieving
considerable survival advantages  You'd probably say that God just
made the rules  Neither of us can convince the other but we share a
common understanding about many moral issues  You think you get it
from your religion I think I get it and you get it from early
childhood teaching

That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God
or God's commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your
nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled
with a preexisting thoughtset to form that reaction 

I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books but in
prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're
saying  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as God
commanded the genocide of the Canaanites is mechanistic but of
course I think that's true of you as well  My reaction has little to
do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does but
if a god existed who commanded genocide I could not consider him
good which is supposedly an attribute of God

All of this being so you have excluded
yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil
etc and cannot participate Your opinion about the Bible can have no
weight whatsoever

Hmm  Yes I think some heavy FAQreading would do you some good  I
have as much place discussing values etc as any other person  In
fact I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion by
framing the questions in terms of reason for instance it is clear
that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt
to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands then the
quality of life will be generally poor so a system that fosters
coexistence is superior if quality of life is an agreed goal  An
absolutist on the other hand can only thump those portions of a
Bible they happen to agree with and say this is good even if the
act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in
the discussion  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as
excluded from discussion such that they cannot participate and
their opinions given no weight whatsoever is the lowest form or
reasoning ad hominempoisoning the well and presumably the resort
of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right
wrong and the Bible

 Hi
 
 I have been having an argument about the origins of the bible lately with
 a theist acquaintance  He stated that thousands of bibles were discovered
 at a certain point in time which were syllableperfect  This therefore
 meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time the time quoted
 by my acquaintace was approximately  years after the death of Jesus

You can tell your friend from me that I was in a publisher's
warehouse one time and saw thousands of copies of The Joy of
Cooking and every one of them was syllableperfect

I have since sold all I own and become a follower of The Joy
of Cooking  The incident I mentioned convinced me once and
for all that The Joy of Cooking is inspired by god and the
one true path to his glory

Since this is altatheism I hope you don't mind if we strongly disagree

 The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to 
 But think about it for a minute  Would you rather have someone love
 you because you made them love you or because they wanted to
 love you     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward
 Him  He promises to be there for you but you have to look for yourself

Indeed knock and it shall be opened to you Dan why didn't this work
I firmly believed in god for  years but I eventually realised I was
only deluding myself fearful to face the truth Ultimately the only reason
what kept me believing was the fear of hell The mental states I 
had sillily attributed to divine forces or devil's attempts to 
destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination and it is easy
to achieve the same mental states at will 

My faith was just learned fear in a disguise

 Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort

God is demanding too much Dan what was it I believed in for  years
If sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief 
what it was in my case  I'd rather quit If god does not help me to
keep the faith I can't go on 

Besides I am concerned with god's morality and mental health Does
she really want us to believe in herself without any help revelations
guidance or anything I can feel If she has created us why didn't
she make the task any easier Why are we supposed to love someone who
refuses to communicate with us What is the point of eternal torture
for those who can't believe

I love god just as much as she loves me If she wants to seduce me
she'll know what to do 

 Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you will see
 that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic
 Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  Yet some think it is
 the ultimate  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
 know more than you do now 

Your argument is of the type you'll know once you try
Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried and believed
for many years but were eventually honest enough to admit that 
they had lived in a virtual reality

What else but reason I can use I don't have the spiritual means 
Christians often refer to My conscience disagrees with the Bible
I don't even believe I have a soul I am fully dependent on my
body  indeed I am this body When it goes up with flames so
does my identity God can entertain herself with copies of me
if she wants

 To learn you must accept that which you don't know

What does this mean To learn you must accept that you don't know 
something righto But to learn you must accept something I don't
know why This is not the way I prefer to learn It is unwise to
merely swallow everything you read Suppose I write a book telling
how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn tm has helped me in my
daily problems would you accept this since you can't know whether
it is true or not

Note that the GIPU is also omnipotent omnipresent and loves just
about everyone Besides He and She is guiding every writer on this planet
you and me and not just some people who write legendary stories
 years ago

Your god is just one aspect of His and Her Presence

Mathew I agree  This it seems is the crux of your whole position
isn't it  That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him arms
to fight Iran  I agree  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those
who did or do  But we did sell arms to Hussein and it's a done deal
Now he invades Kuwait  So do we just sit back and say Well we sold
him all those arms I suppose he just wants to use them now  Too bad
for Kuwait  No unfortunately sitting back and letting things be
is not the way to correct a former mistake  Destroying Hussein's
military potential as we did was the right move  But I agree with
your statement Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to
sell arms to Hussein  So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor
so much it was the US's and the West's shortsightedness in selling
arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable right

If so then I agree

 In light of what happened in Waco I need to get something of my
 chest

Sadly understandable

 
 Faith and dogma are dangerous  

Yes

 
 Religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma and
 for that reason I scorn religion
 
To be fair you should really qualify this as semiticwestern religions but
you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway

 I have expressed this notion in the past  Some Christians debated
 with me whether Christianity leaves any room for reasoning  I claimed
 rationality is quelled out of Christianity by faith and dogma

Again this should really be evaluated at a personal level  For example there
was only one Jesus presumably and he probably didn't say all that many
things and yet seemingly billions and billions of Christian sects have
arisen  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and
believes in Christ as in pantheism  It would seem to go against the Bible but
it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal
interpretation

 A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind
 whereas a Christian cannot due to the nature of faith and dogma present
 in any religion

This is a good point  We have here the quintessential Christian he sets up a
system of valuesbeliefs for himself which work very well and every
eventexperience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this
system  However we also have an individual who has the inability at least
not without some difficulty to change which is important because the problem
with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to
the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system
without destroying whatever faith is invested therein unless of course all
the tests fail  In other words the fairer way would be to test and evaluate
moralities without the biasresponsibility of losingretaining a system

 
 I claimed that a Christian philosopher'' is not a Christian
 but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those
 of Christianity Consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison
 is not a prisoner unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone
 in a prison
 Can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison
 Can we define a Christian to be someone who at the moment has Christian
 beliefs  No because if a person is free to go he is not a prisoner
 Similarly if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma he is not
 a Christian

Interesting but again when it seems to basically boil down to individual
nuances although not always I will admit and probably it is the
massoriented divisions which are the most appalling it becomes irrelevant
unfortunately

 
 I admit it's a word game
 I'm going by the dictionary definition of religion
    religion n  concern over what exists beyond the visible world
      differentiated from philosophy in that it operates through faith
      or intuition rather than reason ''
                                    Webster's
 
 Now let's go beyond the word game  I don't claim that religion
 causes genocide  I think that if all humans were atheist there
 would still be genocide  There will always be humans who don't think
 There will always be humans who don't ask themselves what is
 the REAL difference between themselves and people with different
 colored skin or a different language or different beliefs
 

Granted

 Religion is like the gun that doesn't kill anybody  Religion encourages
 faith and dogma and although it doesn't directly condemn people
 it encourages the use of just because'' thinking  It is
 just because'' thinking that kills people
 

In which case the people become the bullets and the religion as the gun
merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if I
may be so bold as to extend your similie

 Sure religion has many good qualities  It encourages benevolence
 and philanthropy  OK so take out only the bad things like faith
 dogma and tradition  Put in the good things like careful reasoning
 and science  The result is secular humanism  Wouldn't it
 be nice if everyone were a secular humanist   To please the
 supernaturalists you might even leave God in there but the secular
 emphasis would cause the supernaturalists to start thinking and
 they too would realize that a belief in a god really doesn't put
 anyone further ahead in understanding the universe OK I'm just
 poking fun at the supernaturalists 

Also understandable 

 
 Of course not all humans are capable of thought and we'd still
 have genocide and maybe even some mass suicidebut not as much
 I'm willing to bet on that

 The other is to ask you what you think is wrong with relativism so that we
 can correct your misconceptions 
 
 Well I can cut to the chase and admit that what I find least attractive about
 realtivism is that it elevates the heinous to the level of the good by
 saying in effect to each his own or what's good for you  isn't good
 for me  Thus the terrorist is elevated to the same level as the man
 of peace

This is complete nonsense  Relativism means saying that there is no absolute
standard of morality it does NOT mean saying that all standards of morality
are equally good

Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others
How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference
And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
it isn't an objective reality for values

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how
deviant the view as I've articulated it above which may not be
the true view of Khomeini is from the basic principles of Islam 

From the point ov view of an atheist I see you claim Khomeini wasn't
practicing true Islam  But I'm sure that he would have said the same about
you  How am I a member of neither group supposed to be able to tell which
one of you two is really a true Muslim

This is a very good point I have already made the clear claim that
Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an
and have given my arguments for this This is something that can be
checked by anyone sufficiently interested Khomeini being dead
really can't respond but another poster who supports Khomeini has
responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry This should
be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist
modes of obfuscationism 

So to answer your question the only way you can judge is by learning 
more about Islam that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's 
basic principles Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see 
who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at 
odds with Islam Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve 
muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles 
of Islam which is that no human being is metaphysically different than 
any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical 
nature

  compelling  If you want to refute a point then do so but do it

  And have you ever considered that perhaps these people actually
  believe what they say  That they are not just spreading

I have considered it But if someone spreads falsehoods out of
ignorance then they are still spreading falsehoods Those falsehoods
generally do not come out of nowhere but are produced by people
who know that what they are saying is at least not the whole
truth I still consider such spreading of falsehoods propaganda
on some level


 I'm not in a position to say since I know nothing

 The willingness of true believers
 to die for their belief be it in Jesus or Jim Jones is
 welldocumented so martyrdom in and of itself says little

It does say something about the depth of their belief  Religion has
both deluded believers and con men  The difference is often how far
they will follow their beliefs

I have no first hand or even second hand knowledge of how the 
original apostles died  If they began a myth in hopes of exploiting
it for profit and followed that myth to the death that would be
inconsistent  Real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would 
lead to discomfort pain and death

The story in  Kings regarding the  prophets of Baal is of no
help in this debate  One can easily assume that they believed that
no overwhelming vindication of Elijah would be forthcoming  He was
simply a fool who would be shown to be so  The fire from heaven was
swift and their seizure and deaths were equally swift

Here's another quote from the same source as your quote above

Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to mean the same thing  But
they don't  Evolution of life over a very long period of time is a
fact if we are to believe evidence gathered during the last two
centuries from geology paleontology molecular biology and many other
scientific disciplines  Despite the many believers in Divine creation
who dispute this  the probability that evolution has occurred
approaches certainty in scientific terms  Hitching The Neck of

Mr King next time you quote someone at least read the rest of what

everyone  Of course we all know you have probably never even looked
at the book you most likely copied that quote off some list your
pastor gave you

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how

the true view of Khomeini is from the basic principles of Islam 

From the point ov view of an atheist I see you claim Khomeini wasn't
practicing true Islam  But I'm sure that he would have said the same about
you  How am I a member of neither group supposed to be able to tell which
one of you two is really a true Muslim

Easy  just read the Koran Because the Koran is perfect there is
no possibility of disagreement   

Okay I see smilies so this isn't supposed to be a serious post
On the other hand I would suppose it does has some motivation behind
it Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion but there is 
presumably some sort of reasoning behind it As an argument this 
statement is worthless Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious 
text whatever that might be there is still plenty of room for 
disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials

I've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made
between two people who in fact do disagree about Islam which doesn't
presume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficient
clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of
Islam This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have
disagreements about all issues relevant to Islam

 How does one falsify any origin theory For example are a forever existing
 universe or abiogenesis strictly falsifiable
 
 The same way that any theory is proven false  You examine the predicitions
 that the theory makes and try to observe them  If you don't or if you
 observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen then you have some 
 evidence against the theory  If the theory can't be modified to 
 incorporate the new observations then you say that it is false

 But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment In many types ofexperiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will happen again
and be capable of being observed For example in chemistry someone may predict
 the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction
repeatedly You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life So it seems we could never say That's exactly how it happenedAs far as we know that event was unobserved At least no one has admitted
 it   So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability
 strictly speaking are lacking
  

	Can't resist because I've thought about it

	Basically what is being constructed is a theory of abiogenesis
There are any number of criterion that would have to be satisfied for
the theory to be accurate such as the hotly discussed topic of
stereoisomerism  Just making life in the lab wouldn't suffice for
all the wonder that would engender because for the theory of
abiogenesis to be accurate the life would have to resemble the best
idea we have of what the earliest lifeforms resembled

	Comes down to that old question Can we ever really be sure

	But if were to examine a claim that abiogenesis had been
demonstrated in the laboratory AND was the most likely path followed on
primordial Earth I would look for the following

	  Experiment reproduced a plausible primordial Earth
	environment

	  ALL contamination sources were eliminated

	  The lifeform produced resembles primitivesimple Earth
	lifeforms

	  The theory accounts for differences in the modern
	Earth environment and primitive Earth environment

NOW if those criteria were satisfied Dr Abio who performed the
experiment would then be in possession of the best candidate for
a theory of abiogenesis on the primordial Earth  At which point Dr
BBio could then counter with a decisive critique keyed on an aspect
of the theory which doesn't match the early Earth environment or
a characteristic of the new lifeform that doesn't resemble life
on Earth  Were he to suggest an improvement to eliminate the
discrepancies and perform an experiment to demonstrate his claims
Dr BBio would then have the best theory
	Never provable  constantly modifiable  progressing ever
closer to the correct answer until the evidence is overwhelming
and even when it is a theory that explains even MORE may take its
place 

	 that's a scientific theory

Merely a question for the basis of morality

MoralEthical behavior  Societally acceptable behavior
Who is society
How do they define what is acceptable
How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position
MAC

Wow You got me thinking now

This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a 
move in society to classify previously socially unacceptable yet legal 
activities as OK  In the past it seems to me there were always two 
coexisting methods of social control

First and most explicit is legal control  That is the set of 
actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set 
of punishments

Secondly and somewhat more hidden is social control  These are 
the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered 
by legal control are scrictly controled by social censure Ideally if 
socialization is working as it should legal control is hardly ever needed 
since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of 
social censure

The control manifests itself in daytoday life as guilt and 
morality  I've heard it said and fully believe that if it weren't for 
the VAST majority of people policing themselves legal control would be 
absolutely impossible

Lately last   years however there has been a move to 
attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control ie if it ain't 
illegal then don't pick on me  I'm not saying this is wrong merely 
that it is a byproduct of a society which has

	 A high education level
	 A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media
	 A high level of institutionalized individual rights and
	 A me oriented culture

I guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition 
here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can
can't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness yet we 
are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as 
those freedoms don't impinge on another's

IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here  While we 
appreciate and persue individual rights these satisfy the old 
territoriality and dominance instincts the removal of socialized 
inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the 
continued destabilization of society  

I got no quick fix  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this 
mess  I know I would never consent to the rollback of personal freedoms 
in order to stabilize society  Yet I believe development of societies 
follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability  Can we find a 
social model which maximizes indiv freed's yet is stable  Perhaps it is 
possible to live with a nonstable society

Anybody see a way out  Comments

The US has not sold Iraq any arms  Their navy is entirely made of
FUSSR vessels  Their airforce not including stuff captured from Kuwait
which I am not as sure about doesn't include any US equipment  Their
missiles are all nonUS  Their tanks are almost all soviet with about
 French tanks older ones The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal

other countries like Kuwait  Information is hard to prove  You are
claiming that the US sold information  Prove it 

Now how did the US build up Iraq again  I just gave some fairly
conclusive evidence that the US didn't sell arms to Iraq  Information
is hard to prove almost certainly if the US did sell information then that
fact is classified and you can't prove it  If you can provide some
useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq
I am very interested but not if you just make claims based on what
everyone knows

My turn
I went back and reread your post  All you did is attack atheism and
say that agnosticism wasn't as funny as atheism  Nowhere does that
imply that you are agnostic or weak atheist  As most people who post
such inflammatory remarks are theists it was a reasonable assumption

Sorry you're right  I did not clearly state it

Rule   Condescending to the population at large ie theists will not
win many people to your faith anytime soon  It only ruins your credibility

How am I being condescending to the population at large  I am stating
something that happened to be true for a long time I couldn't believe
that people actually believed in this god idea  It was an alien concept
to me  I am not trying to win people to my faith as you put it  I have
no faith  Religion was a non issue when I had the attitude above because
it never even occurred to me to believe  Atheist by default I guess you
could say

The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational
attitude  Once one has accepted the assumption that there is no gods
and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their
assumptions contradict your assumption then I would say there's a
lack of consistency here

Now I know you'll get on me about faith  If the positive belief that God
does not exist were a closed logical argument why do so many rational
people have problems with that logic

But you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist  Sorry for the flamage

The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed
to imply that  Sorry been reading too much on the CLIPPER project lately
and the paranoia over there may have seeped in some

  What is the CLIPPER project BTW

Rule   Don't mix apples with oranges  How can you say that the
extermination by the Mongols was worse than Stalin  Khan conquered people
unsympathetic to his cause  That was atrocious  But Stalin killed millions of
his own people who loved and worshipped him and his atheist state  How can
anyone be worse than that

Many rulers have done similar things in the past only Stalin did it
when there was plenty of documentation to afix the blame on him  The
evidence is that some of the early European rulers ruled with an iron
fist much like Stalin's  You threw in numbers and I am sick of hearing
about Stalin as an example because the example doesn't apply  You
managed to get me angry with your post because it appeared to attack
all forms of atheism

It might have appeared to attack atheism in general but its point was
that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons  People will hate who
they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or
hammersickle  The Stalin example is important not only because it's
still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also
because people really did love him and his ideas even after all that he
had wrought

The evidence I am referring to is more a lack of evidence than negative
evidence  Say I claim there are no pink crows  I have never seen
a pink crow but that doesn't mean it couldn't exist  But this person
here claims that there are pink crows even though he admits he hasn't
been able to capture one or get a photo or find one with me etc
In a sense that is evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crows
That is what I am saying when I look at the evidence  I look at the
suppossed evidence for a deity show how it is flawed and doesn't show
what theists want it to show and go on

First all the pink crowsunicornselves arguments in the world will not
sway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy  Why

One of the big reasons is that many many people want something
beyond this life  You can pretend that they don't want this but I for
one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes

And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God
Can love as a truth be proven logically

themselves namely a god or gods  So in principle it's hard to see how
theists are necessarily arrogant

Makes no sense to me  They seem arrogant to make such a claim to me
But my previous refutation still stands and I believe there may be
another one on the net

John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people  I find it hard to see
how that behavior is arrogant at all  Many Christians I know also boast
in this way but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance  Of course
I do know arrogant Christians doctors and teachers as well  Technically
you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant
Jesus for instance

Are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism  If you are
talking about weak atheism which I believe in then I refuse such a claim
Atheism is a lack of belief  I used good ol' Occam's Razor to make the
final rejection of a deity in that as I see things even if I
present the hypothesises in an equal fasion I find the theist argument
not plausible

I speak against strong atheism  I also often find that the evidence
supporting a faith is very subjective just as say the evidence supporting
love as truth is subjective

I believe I answered that  I apologize for the as you stated incorrect
assumption on your theism but I saw nothing to indicate that you
were an agnostic only that you were just another newbie Christian
on the net trying to get some cheap shots in

No apology necessary

	I wonder if the Universe would look like a Black Hole
from outside How could we posit an Outside whether called
DeSitter space hyperspace parallel universes whatever

I don't think that the universe would look like a black hole from
the outside because that would imply that similar to a black hole we
would see stuff coming in from the outside

  Now that has always confused me  Once a black hole forms I don't see how
anything could pass the event horizon perhaps including the original mass that
formed is forming the black hole in the first place

  Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to
travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of   
infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

As I understand things this is just a matter of perspective If you are
on the outside looking in it appears that nothing can ever enter the
black hole as something approaches the event horizon it appears to slow
and never gets there However if you are on the object looking out you
get an entirely different view As you look out you will see the universe
speed up and ultimately will witness the collapse or heat death of
the universe without

  I saw one theist on this net talking about the absurdity of one saying he
doesn't believe in god and how can we be sure  The problem with this and
other arguments assumes that the burden of proof lies with the atheist Wrong
In philosophy the one who is making a positive argument must give reasons for
his believing so not the negative  If I were to make the statement elves 
exist then it would be up to me to prove my positive assertion not the 
person saying that elves don't exist  If the negative in this case had to 
prove elves don't exist he would have to omniscient and know every inch of the
universe  The same applies with god  Give me your reasons and you the theist make the case

The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral
truths and the method by which they can be established  If we accept
that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to
what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved
by any facts about the nature of the world
 
This can be avoided in at least two ways  By leaving the Good
undefined since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is
either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a
reply
 
If the Good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that
they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism
 
 By defining the Good solely in terms of evaluative terms
 
Ditto here  An evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the
part of the person making it
 
At this point the objectivist may talk of 'selfevident truths'
 
Pretty perceptive that Prof Flew
 
but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that selfevidence is in the
mind of the beholder
 
Of course by denying that subjectobject is true dichotomy
 
Please explain how this helps  I don't see your argument
 
If not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true
 
If nothing then NO moral judgements are true  This is a thing that
is commonly referred to as nihilism  It entails that science is of
no value irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful  How
anyone arrives at relativismsubjectivism from this argument beats me
 
This makes no sense either  Flew is arguing that this is where the
objectivist winds up not the subjectivist  Furthermore the nihilists
believed in nothing except science materialism revolution and the
People
 
The subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are
some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself
To hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be
true but to have preferences regarding human activity
 
And if those preferences should include terrorism that moral opinion
is not true  Likewise if the preferences should include noTerrorism
that moral opinion is not true  Why should one choose a set of
preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes
noTerrorism  Oh no reason  This is patently absurd
 
And also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out

I read an article about a poll done of students at the Ivy League
schools in which it was reported that a third of the students
indentified themselves as atheists  This is a lot higher than among the
general population  I wonder what the reasons for this discrepancy are
Is it because they are more intelligent  Younger  Is this the wave of
the future

the same kind of ignorance is demonstrated in just about every post
in this newsgroup  For instance generalizations about Christianity
are popular
 
Which newsgroup have you been reading  The few antiChristian posts are
virtually all in response to some Christian posting some YOU WILL ALL
BURN IN HELL kind of drivel
 
I'm a soft atheist courtesy of the FAQ but even I know enough about
the Bible to see that it repeatedly warns of false prophets preaching
in the name of God
 
Bake it is transparently obvious that you are a theist pretending to be
an atheist  You probably think you are very clever but we see this all
the time
 
But the possibilities of creator and eternity carry with them too much
emotional power to dismiss merely on the basis of this line
 
But of course you have dismissed them because you are an atheist
right
 
just like any other religion hard atheism is a faith
 
In other words you didn't read the FAQ after all

Merely a question for the basis of morality

MoralEthical behavior  Societally acceptable behavior

Who is society

Society is the collection of individuals which will fall under selfdefined
rules  In terms of UN decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented
at the UN are considered part of that society If we then look at US federal
laws provided by representatives of purely US citizens then the society for
that case would be the citizens of the US and so on

How do they define what is acceptable

Acceptable are those behaviours which are either legislated for the
society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are
nonverbally and in effect nonconsciously such as picking your nose on
the Oprah Winfrey show noone does it but there is no explicit law against
doing it In many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a
behaviour is acceptable but one can deduce these behaviours by
observation


How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position

In an increasingly litigation mad society this trap is becoming exceedingly
difficult to avoid With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures
in American and Australian to bring in my local perspective culture the
boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may
eventually become the definition of moral behaviour For instance some
cultures' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals
Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent However is
it moral according to the multicultural american society This kind of
problem may only be definable by legislation 

Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is
acceptable behaviour or not and much of this will be due to different
environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions  

One thing is for sure there is no universal moral code which will suit all
cultures in all situations  There may however be some globally accepted
mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable
concept The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon
this earth are living in a similar environment if that ever happens

     We are talking about origins not merely science   Science cannot
     explain origins  For a person to exclude anything but science from
     the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth
     than science 

 This is a false premise

In what manner  If you argue that the universe was created with a higher
truth than science btw I would love to see you define truth in this
arguement then you must state how you know this and what it is  To subbornly
state that there is a higher truth and that it isyour god I would ask you to prove it
This obviously you cannot do  Besides if I assume for the moment that
there is a 'higher truth' then how can you prove it is your god and not 
another religion's  What makes you so arrogant to push forward your idea
of creation over many peoples' study of the laws of nature ie science

Science is the study of nature  It is openminded if the theory doesn't fit the
facts then trash the theory and try to construct one which does  It is flexible
Your definition of science presupposes that science ignores this god 
character altogether  If this is so then it is only because no evidence 
can be found of him

  By the way I enjoy science

So do I  Fortunately I am not mentally shackled into constructing my
scientific conclusions by placing god Jesus and the holy ghost into every
paragraph in a sycophantic manner

     It is truly a wonder observing God's creation  Macroevolution is
     a mixture of  percent science and  percent religion guaranteed
     within three percent error  
 


Indeed it is a wonder observing the random effects of creation  This of
course assumes a definition of aethetics which you don't forward


As to Macroevolution  please give references and more information  From
where do you get your figures

  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else
Twaddle You're overloading the meaning of the word value
that's all Whether I care if the results are true is a value
I fail to see how whether they are true correct whatever is
a value
The result's actual truth is independent of what you think of it if you
care to look at it that way  however your perception of a result's
truth cannot match its actual truth unless you care to follow the a
procedure to obtain truth science correctly
Not true Consider the case of a coin I flip it and do not look
at it It is either heads or tails It is entirely possible
for me to simply choose to believe that it is heads or tails and
be right Now there is a procedure for ensuringmore or less
that my belief will be correct but it is quite possible for me
to be correct without following it

 You have to pick 
the right procedure and note its importance  You've got to value it
No I don't I can do perfectly good science without valuing
the procedure But you're just overloading the term value
again Judgement of the validity of a procedure is not the
same as judgement of how preferable a certain action is and
just because the word value can be applied to both doesn't
make it so You might as well assert that number theory is
based on values

Otherwise you don't care about actual truth and shouldn't object
to the statement objectivism is true
Huh This is a complete non sequiter

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively and science is a procedure
science cannot be valued nonsubjectively
You're just overloading the word value AGAIN I suspect

   If we're picking facts
and hypotheses subjectively then we are using a maybenotquitesure
method on maybenotquitesure observations  That should lead
to maybenotquitesure results no  The fact that it does not seem
to might make one question the premise which is that our subjective
valuations are necessarily unreliable
I don't understand your point here What do you mean by not quitesure
observations It gets observed all the time that if you don't
buy into a whole series of assumptions about how science is
done the results become meaningless 

If you're suggesting that because science is allegedly chosen
'subjectively' the results have to be inconsistent that's
silly

Like I said before DES works whether I value my privacy or
not
OK which DES  The abstract function DES that stops working in any 
important sense if noone cares for the importance of truth mathematics 
meaning information etc  A DES chip or DES sw  That stops working in any 
important sense if noone values science objective reality etc   DES
does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either
This is just truth by blatant assertion Your in any important sense
seem to be just weasel words Imagine that I have a box which
accepts  bytes and uses the first  to ECB the second 
It still does a perfect job of DESing whether or not any input
is being made at the timewhether or not anyone values mathematics

	First I want to start right out and say that I'm a Christian  It 
makes sense to be one  Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book liar 
lunatic or the real thing  I might be a little off on the title but he 
writes the book  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity 
in the process he became a Christian himself

Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy  Just what organization did he 
belong to Does it have a name

	The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a 
modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he was

Logic alert  artificial trifercation  The are many other possible explainations  Could have been
that he never existed  There have been some good points made in this group that is not 
impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths Mithra comes to mind

	Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows  Who would 
die for a lie  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar  People 
gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing 
someone who was or had been healed  Call me a fool but I believe he did 
heal people  


Logic alert   argument from incredulity  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't
mean that it isn't true  Liars can be very pursuasive just look at Koresh that you yourself site
He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die
By not giving up after getting shot himself Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what 
he believes  As far as healing goes  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not
consistent between the different gospels  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more 
that faith healers can pull off today  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling
so the stories got bigger to appeal better

	Niether was he a lunatic  Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
to someone who was crazy  Very doubtful in fact rediculous  For example 
anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see 
this right away
	Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the 
real thing  


Or might not have existed or any number of things  That is the logical pitfall that those who
use flawed logic like this fall into  There are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because
in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are 
possible  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among
the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding
all other possible alternatives

However if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the 
incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices  I have given at 
least one valid alternative so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of
the other two alternative is no longer valid

	Some other things to note  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in 
the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone  This in his betrayal 
and Crucifixion  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I 
write I will use it

JC was a rabbi  He knew what those prophecies were  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make
sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy  What would be compeling is if there
were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then  yet 
fullfilled them anyway

	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is  It 
is certainly not what I see a lot in churches  Rather I think it 
should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's 
sake  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the 
same  Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives 
over to him  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it to be a 
real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at  But 
just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes 
time  We don't rush it in one day Christianity is your whole life  
It is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in 
a while  We box everything into time units  Such as work at this 
time sports Tv social life  God is above these boxes and should be 
carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for 
ourselves  

Here I agree with you  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says 
seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of life  I have very little respect for 
Xians that don't  If the myth is true then it is true in its entirity  The picking and choosing
that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth

But you have been courteous and therefore received courtesy in return  This
person instead has posted one of the worst arguments I have ever seen
made from the proChristian people  I've known several Jesuits who would
laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them

Let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment nice
word Maddi original or is it a real word and concentrate on the
liar lunatic part

The argument claims that no one would follow a liar let alone thousands
of people  Look at L Ron Hubbard  Now he was probably not all there
but I think he was mostly a liar and a conartist  But look at how many
thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology  I think the 
Baker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all
the time but look at the number of follower they have

As for lunatics the best example is Hitler  He was obviously insane
his advisors certainly thought so  Yet he had a whole country entralled
and came close to ruling all of Europe  How many Germans gave their lives
for him  To this day he has his followers

I'm just amazed that people still try to use this argument  It's just
so obviously wrong

  Really  You don't know what objective value is  If I offered the people
  of the US collectively  for all of the land in America would that 
  sound like a good deal  
 
  Well that would depend on how much we wanted the US and how much
  we wanted the  wouldn't it
 
 Yes it would  Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality

Suppose Xist saucers land  The aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo
 on people's foreheads and start sacrificing small children  Then a
bunch of other aliens come along and offer to get rid of the Xists in return
for one dollar  The people happen to have a single dollar bill hidden during
the purge

Get the point  None of these events are inherently impossible  So it is
not the case that the value of a dollar bill is fixed by reality

For a more mundane example of how the value of a dollar bill is not constant
consider the following game thought up by the RAND corporation

You are with a bunch of friends  You have a  bill  You offer to sell the
 bill to the highest bidder  subject to the restriction that you also
get to take the money bid by the secondhighest bidder

Try it  You'll find that sometimes people will end up bidding more than 
for your  bill

I'm one of those people who does not know what the word objective means
when put next to the word morality  I assume its an idiom and cannot
be defined by its separate terms
 
Give it a try
 
Objective morality is morality built from objective values
 
From A Dictionary of Philosophy by Anthony Flew
 
Objectivism  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would
remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired  For
instance 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another
simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a
plausible example  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it the
contention remains true just as '    ' remains correct even if
there is no one left to count  The problem for the objectivist is to
determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be
established  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what
is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then
they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world  Nor
can they be analytic since this would involve lack of actionguiding
content  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in
virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to
action see analytic and synthetic  At this point the objectivist may
talk of 'selfevident truths' but can he deny the subjectivist's claim
that selfevidence is in the mind of the beholder  If not what is left
of the claim that some moral judgements are true  THe subjectivist may
well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements
with which he would wish to associate himself  To hold a moral opinion
is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have
preferences regarding human activity

I don't think you're right about Germany  My daughter was born there and
I don't think she has any German rights eg to vote or live there beyond the
rights of all EC citizens  She is a British citizen by virtue of
her parentage but that's not full citizenship  For example I don't think
her children could be British by virtue of her in the same way

I am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an
application for it It might require immigration to Germany but
I am almost certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable
in this case

More interesting is your sentence 

In fact many people try to come to the US to have their children
born here so that they will have some human rights

How does the US compare to an Islamic country in this respect  Do people
go to Iran so their children will have some human rights  Would you

More interesting only for your propaganda purposes I have said several
times now that I don't consider Iran particularly exemplary as a good
Islamic state We might talk about the rights of people in capitalist
secular third world countries to give other examples of the lack of
rights in third world countries broadly Say for example Central
American secular capitalist countries whose govt's the US supports
but who Amnesty International has pointed out are human rights vacua

If some society came up with a good reason for why rape and murder are ok I 
would be consistent with my position and hold that it was still wrong  My 
basis of morality is not on societal norms or on current legalities  My basis
is surprise surprise on both the Bible and on inherent moral abhorrences for
lack of a better way to put it to certain things  Yes that's vague and the
only way I know off the top of my head to defend it is to say that all humans 
are similarly made Yes that falls into the trap of creation and why follow 
the Bible  My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust goodness 
love respect courage and honesty in any society rather than deceipt hatred
disrespect cowardness and dishonesty  No I haven't been everywhere and 
seen everyone but according to my thesis I don't have to since I hold that
we were all created similarly  If that makes an unfalsifiable thesis just say
so and I'll both work out what I can and punt to fellow theists

I'm one of those people who does not know what the word objective means 
when put next to the word morality  I assume its an idiom and cannot
be defined by its separate terms

Give it a try

Objective morality is morality built from objective values

Well that got us a long way Now define objective value and
make sure that you are referring to moral not scientific values

While your at it take a look at the definition of objective and
values If you don't have a dictionary I've written those definitons
in a couple of recent postings

Actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US
and allied action  If some backwater country took over some other
backwater country we probably wouldn't intervene  Not that we don't
care but we can't be the world's policman  Or if a coup had occured
in Kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldn't have acted
because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to
Saudi Arabia  But the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion
by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil 
interests caused us to take action

There are many indications that would have taken place had Saddam
been wanting or planning on going into Saudi Arabia  There were
none  This has been openly stated by exPentagon analysts  Pull

I'm not setting up a strawman at all  If you want to argue against the
war then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep
Kuwait  Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective

Actually reports from other mideast countries showed that Hussein
was ready to make concessions due to the sanctions  We just didn't want
him to  we wanted to crush him as well as battletest all these high
tech toys we've built over the years

Probably because we're not the saviors of the world  We can't police each

are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet East Timor or
some other places

We're also hypocrites of the first magnitude  Obviously we don't give
a shit about freedom and democracy  All we care about is our oil  Oh
and the excuse now that the Soviets are gone from the board to keep
a sizable military presence in the gulf region  Care to make bets about
when ALL our troops will come home

Basically Saddam was OK with us  He was a killer who tortured his
own people used gas on them and other horrors  he was a brutal
dictator but he was OUR brutal dictator  Once he said fuck you to
the US he became the next Hitler  The same for Noriega  He was a
bastard but he was OUR bastarduntil he changed his mind and went

Bill Conner bilokcforumosrheedu wrote

 If there is a God as described by the Christians for instance then
 He has existence apart from and independent of humankind His
 existence is outside of our frame of reference reality

Thus god does not really exist How true This claim would
lend substantial support to the notion that religions are actually
seamless virtual realities

Does god exist or not To us this question is a true dichotomy

Can god know a reason for her existence If she is omniscient then
she must know this There is a philosophical problem whether anything
can exist without a time frame  for instance if it were possible to
observe our universe from 'outside' in the neverness surrounding
this universe it would never have existed 

Thus we are faced with a trilemma

 God 'metaexists' and from this metaexisting perspective she
created existence the Universe and everything 

This implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing which
is precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis Lizhi  Shuxian 
Creation of the Universe say This 'nothingness' is not empty enough
it is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence
until there is no 'when' yet but never mind god the source of
all existence started to play I fail to see the difference between
these two forms of nothingness though If there isn't one it might
be god is not necessary for creation

It is obvious that the levels of 'metaexistence' are not necessarily
limited to god there might be a 'metagod' on some other level

 God exists and has always existed she has a timescale which
is different from our own This sounds sensible but it is difficult
to conceive how she could know why she exists  a being which
has always existed and is infinitely conscious of itself can
remember that she has always been the same and perhaps know herself
completely but she cannot know why she exists and how she knows
everything she knows Would a knowledge of how a being with a 
personality a subjective viewpoint knows everything be this
being's knowledge A conscious being conscious of everything is
actually a contradiction in terms  it means that god is only
conscious of herself since we and the whole universe are
already incorporated in her mental models thoroughly modelled
Actually a conscious being conscious of only itself is not
conscious at all 

 God is herself the Existence This is nothing more than an Orwellian
redefinition of the word existence A logical consequence of this
statement is that god is actually all existence I think this is
also called a form of pantheism

 If this
 being declares a thing to be so it is necessarily so since He has
 defined Himself as omnipotent and if His claims are to be believed
 He is at least omnipotent relative to us God is intrinsically
 selfdefined and all reality is whatever He says it is  in an
 objective sense

In a reality god is supposed to have created I cannot believe in
her is that my fault or the creator's fault God gave me freedom
of choice but nevertheless knows what I will opt for is it fair
play on her side

If god has a conscious mind in any sense she has a point of view
I'd say she is entitled to her opinions about me but I still insist
that any harm she might attempt to do to me will be met with 
resistance and disapproval 

 If God determines a standard of conduct that standard is objective

No an objective standard means something independent on any
subjective viewpoint including god's point of view 

 If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that
 standard while permitted to ignore it they substitute a relative
 morality or mode of conduct giving the term morality a nebulous
 meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to
 misunderstand The standard is objective and the conduct required to
 meet that standard is therefore objectively determined

What standard My morality and my conscience  disagrees with the
'standards' of the Bible Which one to ignore How to interpret
any divine standard There is a great discrepancy even among 
Christians on this For instance the Bible does not condemn
female homosexuality  why many Christians do thinking god doesn't
accept it anyway

Bill to reject a concept of any objective morality does not make the
term nebulous Morality is the subjective aspect of societal behaviour
something we can change and something that must change when
societies change It might be some basic concepts are hardwired
in our brains by evolution but in the end we must decide ourselves
I don't think people need religion to keep them moral 
thinking goes beyond threat of punishment 

 Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is
 infinitely malleable doesn't mean that the objective standard itself
 doesn't exist Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural
 norm or the preferred conduct of decent people making it seem
 subjective but it is derived from an absolute objective standard

I've yet to see an objective standard that is 

a universally applicable today and tomorrow
b universally acceptable not against our own concepts of what is
moral and what isn't

 Ironically this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true
 nature according to Christianity at least yet is condemned as being
 contrary to human nre oppressive and severe This may be due as
 much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself but like it
 or not it's there

I don't think Christian morality is of a particularly high standard
although it is probably a reflection of high morals of the time
and much of it is still applicable The problem is that I can't
agree with it all This is not a question of comforting my
conscience with a thought that I won't be responsible with what
I do as Christians would put it My conscience is in an irreconcilable
conflict with the Bible on homosexuality Paul's idea of women's
role in marriage etc and the whole idea that I should believe
in someone I got no help from in this task

Merely a question for the basis of morality

MoralEthical behavior  Societally acceptable behavior
 
I disagree with these  What society thinks should be irrelevant  What the
individual decides is all that is important
 
 This doesn't seem right  If I want to kill you I can because that is what I
 decide

Exactly  Although this may be a dissapointing answer there has to be an
interplay of the two  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality  A person's
selfgeneratedlearned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely
mentalverbal level and don't usually find expression in society except in an
impure not in the sense of bad   state  Sometimes this has to be so


Who is society
 
I think this is fairly obvious
 
 Not really  If whatever a particular society mandates as ok is ok there are
 always some in the society who disagree with the mandates so which 
 societal mandates make the standard for morality

Also what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society in a very
real sense  To use the obvious example there is a political society and a
racial society and a gender society and sometimes they do not always agree on
every issue

  
How do they define what is acceptable
 
Generally by what they feel is right which is the most idiotic policy I can
think of
 
 So what should be the basis Unfortunately I have to admit to being tied at 
 least loosely to the feeling in that I think we intuitively know some things
 to be wrong  Awfully hard to defend though


Yes  Perhaps with an infamous do what you want so long as it doesn't hurt
others  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do it
is not a morality in that it doesn't propound any specifically preferred
behaviours


How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position
 
By thinking for ourselves
 
 I might agree here  Just because certain actions are legal does not make them
 moral

I'll add a hearty me two  However one could just as well say just because
certain actions are moral does not make them legal one still doesn't really
get an impression of which one is truly right

 I guess I'm delving into a religious language area  What exactly is morality 
 or morals  

I hope there is not one with a subject like this you just have a spiral  What
would then be a morality of a morality of morals  Labels don't make arguments 
One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be
interpreted even though this would hardly seem moral  For example The best
thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough  Hence all actions
must be weighed against this one statement  whatever helps this goal is
moral whatever does not is immoral

Of course this leads such a blank space there are so many different ways to
fulfill a goal one would need a hypermorality to apply to just the methods

I never thought of eating meat to be moral or immoral but I think
 it could be  How do we differentiate between not doing something because it is
 a personal choice or preference and not doing something because we see it as 
 immoral  Do we fall to what the basis of these morals are

Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think
about it long enough    On the other hand maybe it is our first gut
reaction  Which  Who knows perhaps here we have a way to discriminate
morals  I don't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right the same way I
instinctively feel torture is wrong but if I thought about it long enough and
listened to the arguments I could perhaps reason that it was wrong is that
possible     See the difference

 
 Also consensus positions fall to a might makes right  Or as you brought out
 if whatever is right is what is societally mandated then whoever is in control
 at the time makes what is right

If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that What
right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally
mandated morality  Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your
brother and say that I was exercising my rights as I saw them was
doing what felt good didn't want anyone forcing their morality on me
or I don't follow your morality 
 
I believe that morality is subjective  Each person is entitled to his
own moral attitudes  Mine are not a priori more correct than someone
elses  This does not mean however that I must judge another on the
basis of his rather than my moral standards  While he is entitled to
believe what his own moral sense tells him the rest of society is
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is
offensive to the majority
 
 Why How Might makes right How can they force their morality on me Why 
 can't I do what I want Who are they to decide What if I disagree 


Well I agree with you in the sense that they have no moral right to inflict
these rules but there is one thing I might add at the very least almost
everybody wants to avoid pain and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a
herd morality then so be it  

 
Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral  The may realize that
it is immoral and not care  They are thus not following their own moral
system but being immoral
 
 Good point but it is being immoral in our opinion  We don't let them choose
 we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them

Right and since they grew up and learned around us they have some idea of our
right and wrong which I think must in part be incorporated  Very rarely do
you see criminal behaviour for philosophical reasons


 
   For someone to lay claim to an alternative
moral system he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be
internally consistent  Some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense
 
 I admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense but have little basis
 for it as of yet  How far can such a concept be extended
 

stuff deleted

 Do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but 
 not him  After all he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he
 chose  On what basis do we condemn other societies besides here's the buzz 
 words on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all 
 societies
 
   Holding that morality is subjective does not mean
that we must excuse the murderer
 
 Why not Do we have to be objective suddenly

The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed
to imply that  Sorry been reading too much on the CLIPPER project lately
and the paranoia over there may have seeped in some

  What is the CLIPPER project BTW

The CLIPPER initiative is an announcement by Clinton that all the 
secure voice phones will use the same crypto chip as a defacto
government standard  Problem is the government is admitting that
they hold the keys to break the code easily and the Justice department
will be using the keys to listen in on illegal activities  Many
people are really scared about such an initiative because it is
a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things
like email if you read the press release  The project was developed
by NSA and given to NIST  It uses two keys S and S that the
government claims are needed to break the code  They claim that
these keys will be handed to two different companies and when they
get a warrant to do a wiretap the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip
they have to get the keys from both companies  People have poked holes
through and through the press release official version and shown how
it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds and I have given the simplified
version  People over on scicrypt are really scared about this
proposal it seems

In light of what happened in Waco I need to get something of my
chest

Faith and dogma are dangerous  

Religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma and
for that reason I scorn religion

I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion but I disagree with
your reasoning  Faith  Bad  Dogma  Bad  Religion  Faith  Dogma
Religion  Bad  Bad  Religion  Bad  Unfortunately you never 
state why faith and dogma are dangerous  

If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in
Waco you are missing the point  

The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the
messenger  They believed Koresh was a prophet and therefore believed
everything he said  The problem wasn't the religion it was the 
followers  They didn't die because of faith and dogma they died because
of their zealotry or in the case of the children the zealotry of their
parents

I have expressed this notion in the past  Some Christians debated
with me whether Christianity leaves any room for reasoning  I claimed
rationality is quelled out of Christianity by faith and dogma

So Christians are totally irrational  Irrational with respect to their
religion only  What are you saying  One's belief in a Christian God does
not make one totally irrational  I think I know what you were getting at
but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject


A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind
whereas a Christian cannot due to the nature of faith and dogma present
in any religion

Again this statement is too general  A Christian is perfectly capable of
being a philosopher and absolutely capable of changing hisher mind  Faith in
God is a belief and all beliefs may change  Would you assert that atheists
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a
God which of course may show unfair bias when studying say religion




I claimed that a Christian philosopher'' is not a Christian
but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those
of Christianity Consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison
is not a prisoner unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone
in a prison
Can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison
Can we define a Christian to be someone who at the moment has Christian
beliefs  No because if a person is free to go he is not a prisoner
Similarly if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma he is not
a Christian

So Christianity is a prison eh  Ever heard of parole  You have read far
too much into this subject  A Christian is one who follows the religion
based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ  Nowhere does this
definition imply that one cannot change one's mind  In prison however
you can't just decide to leave  One is voluntary the other is not  The
two are not compatible


Religion is like the gun that doesn't kill anybody  Religion encourages
faith and dogma and although it doesn't directly condemn people
it encourages the use of just because'' thinking  It is
just because'' thinking that kills people

I prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine 
Seriously though some but certainly not all religions do condemn
groups of people  The common target is the infidel a curious being
who is alternately an atheist a noninsert specific religious
affiliation here a person of a different race or an Egyptian 

Please explain how just because thinking kills people  And please
state more in your answer than Waco


Of course not all humans are capable of thought and we'd still
have genocide and maybe even some mass suicidebut not as much
I'm willing to bet on that

I'll see your conscientious peacenik and raise you a religious 
zealot with bad acne   By the way I wasn't aware mass suicide
was a problem  Waco and Jonestown were isolated incidents  
Mass suicides are far from common

A great many Satanists DO NOT believe in Satan Some do some
don't I'd go so far as to assert that most orthodox Satanists
do not worship Satan Church of Satan etc but rather worship
self To hear LaVey say it only idiots and fools believe in Satan
and or Allah He knew that suckers are born every minute

 Maximus wb

Anton LaVey's interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me  I
read his Satanic Bible a few years ago for a social studies project
as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called The Cult of Devil Worship
in America  The latter included a very interesting interview with
the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an
instrument for one to realize the self  

When I refer to Satanism I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic
ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan  I
don't consider LaVey's church to be at all orthodox nor do I consider
its followers satanists  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche
Crowley and Reich slapped in some religious doctrine added a little
touch of PT Barnum and christened his creation the Church of Satan
No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attentionI
suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex

At any rate it worked for a while  In its heyday the Church had a
huge following including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis Jr
and Jayne Mansfield  I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy by the 
way  

I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as
a Christian not believing in Christ  But if you include the Church of
Satan then I suppose I need to alter my definition  Webster's Dictionary
and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same

The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be
treated as a matter of faith  Francis Hitching

  Neither I nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings  Who is he 
Please do not answer with A well known evolutionist or some other such
informationless phrase

   Francis Hitching is the author of among other books
The Neck of the Giraffe He believes evolution is
directed by some sort of cosmic force but does not like
Darwinism  He wrote in this book  The Neck of the
Giraffe Ticknor  Fields New Haven Connecticut 
p  p  paperback that

   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the
   great unifying principle of biology Darwinism after
   a century and a quarter is in a surprising amount of
   trouble  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to
   mean the same thing  But they don't  Evolution of
   life over a very long period of time is a fact if we
   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two
   centuries from geology paleontology molecular biol
   ogy and many other scientific disciplines  Despite
   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this
    the probability that evolution has occurred
   approaches certainty in scientific terms  On the
   other hand Darwinism or neoDarwinism its modern
   version is a theory that seeks to explain evolution
   It has not contrary to general belief and despite
   very great efforts been proved

   Research on Hitching turned up the following Hitching is
basically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien
tific credentials  In The Neck of the Giraffe he claimed
to be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute but an
inquiry to that institute said he was not  He implied in
the Acknowledgements of The Neck of the Giraffe that
paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writing
of the book but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know him
and had no information about him  Hitching also implied
that his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins but upon
inquiry Dawkins stated I know nothing at all about Francis
Hitching  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char
latan good for you  His book The Neck of the Giraffe
is one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read for
years

   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written on
Mayan pyramid energy and for some In Search Of episodes
on BBC television  The reference work Contemporary
Authors Vol  page  lists him as a member of the
Society for Psychical Research the British Society of
Dowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers  His writ
ings include Earth Magic Dowsing The Psi Connection
Mysterious World An Atlas of the Unexplained Fraud
Mischief and the Supernatural and Instead of Darwin

   Hitching's book spends much of its time attacking Dar
winian evolution borrowing heavily and uncritically from
youngearth creationist arguments  Many of Hitching's ref
erences are lifted from youngearth creationist literature
rather than being quoted directly from their original
sources  One magazine had this to say CreationEvolution
Newsletter  No  pp  SeptemberOctober 

   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society there was
   an interesting letter in the January  issue of
   their journal Biblical Creation p  concerning a
   review of Francis Hitching's  book The Neck of
   the Giraffe  Hitching's book is strongly anti
   Darwinist and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre
   ationists though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist
   creationists  The letter by creationist Malcolm
   Bowden author of The Rise of the Evolution Fraud
   points out that Hitching simply culled his informa
   tion from the creationist literature  This is indeed
   the case  many creationist works are cited favorably
   Anderson Coffin Clark Daly Davidheiser Dewar
   Gish Morris Segraves Whitcomb and Wysong plus
   various antiDarwinists  Hitching does cite Bowden's
   earlier book ApeMen  Fact or Fallacy but Bowden
   accuses Hitching of lifting several passages and
   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment
   in other words plagiarism  Hitchin's sic book is
   largely an exposition of the creationists sic view
   point from the beginning to almost the end Bowden
   points out  Hitching is also a paranormalist an
   advocate of psychic evolution Hitching's book
   Earth Magic is a wild extremely entertaining and
   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc
   tures  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic
   cataclysms Atlantis pyramidology dowsing ESP
   miraculous healing and astrology

 False dichotomy  You claimed the killing were not religiously
 motivated and I'm saying that's wrong   I'm not saying that
 each and every killing is religiously motivate as I spelled out
 in detail
 
 Which killings do you say are religously motivated

For example I would claim that the recent assassination of four
catholic construction workers who had no connection with the IRA
was probably religously motivated

 At the time
 of writing I think that someone who claims the current violence is
 motivated by religion is reaching

What would you call is when someone writes The killings in NI 
are not religously motivated

 Now it's possible to argue that 
 religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in
 the present but I don't know of any evidence that this is so  and I'm
 not enough of a historian to debate it 

Given that the avowed aim of the IRA is to take Northern Ireland
into a country that has a particular church written into its 
constitution and which has restriction on civil rights dictated
by that Church I fail to see why the word past is appropriate


  But to claim that The killings in NI are not religously 
  motivated is grotesque   All that means is that the Church
  and believers are doing what they always do with history
  they can't face they rewrite it
  
  You're attacking a different claim  My claim is that when an IRA
  terrorist plants a bomb in Warrington she does not have as a motive 
  the greater glory of God 
 
 Sorry Frank but what I put in quotes is your own words from your
 posting qibechorusapmchpsnide  Don't tell us now that 
 it's a different claim   If you can no longer stand behind your 
 original claim just say so
 
 I mean the same thing when I say The killings in NI are not religously
 motivated as I do when I say when a terrorist plants a bomb she
 doesn't have a religious motive  The example is meant to clarify not
 to be a new claim  The different claim to which I refer is the claim
 which you were seemingly attacking in the previous post namely that religion 
 is not a major historical cause of the present violence  I don't assert 
 that nor do I assert its opposite

You don't have to hand us a bunch of doubletalk about what
I was seemingly attacking   I quoted what I was attacking

Anyway since I seem to be the only one following this particular line
of discussion I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have
read this book  What are your thoughts on it  

I read it when it first came out and the controversy broke Put my name
on the waiting list at the library that way if the book was really
offensive none of my money would find its way to the author or
publisher and read it cover to cover to use a phrase that seems
popular here right now

And I liked it The writing style was a little hard to get used to but
it was well worth the effort Coming from a similar background Rushdie
grew up in Bombay in a muslim family and moved to England I grew up in
New Delhi it made a strong impression on me  And he used many of the
strange constructions of Indian English the yaar at the end of a
sentence Butbutbut the occasional hindi phrase etc

At the time I still sortakinda thought of myself as a muslim and I
couldn't see what the flap was all about It seemed clear to me that this
was allegory  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who
took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives and had not as my
grandfather thundered implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes in
short every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to
have missed the point completely  And I won't mention the fact that the
most militant of them had never even seen the book Oops I just did

Perhaps in a deep sense the book is insulting to Islam because it
exposes the silliness of revealed religion  why does an omnipotent deity
need an agent She can come directly to me can't she How do we know that
Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something And how
do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up or
put in their own little verses And why can Muhammed marry more than four
women when no other muslim is allowed to Although I think the biggest
insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to
suppress a book sight unseen on the sayso of some holy guy Not to
mention murder the author

Over the years when I have made this point various primarily muslim
posters have responded saying that yes indeed they have read the book
and had called it such things as filth and lies I would rank
Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse and so on

I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book A really
silly argument  after all how many of these same people have read Mein
Kampf It just made me wonder  what are they afraid of Why don't they
just read the book and decide for themselves

Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book and the absence of
protest from the liberal muslims to Khomeini's fatwa outrage was the
final push I needed into atheism

 infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

Not true Only an observer at rest at infinite distance from the black hole
will see the particle take infinite time to reach the horizon In the

 The difference as I understand it is that when one invests one
 shares in the risk of the venture whereas when a bank lends money
 while charging interest the bank takes little risk

The entire business of a Bank is the management of risk   That's
what a Bank is for   That's what people who work for Banks do

 
 Something like that anyway financial stuff ain't my thing

OK but in that case why are you posting about it   What I
hear you saying is I don't understand this stuff but if Islam
says it's so it's so

In the part of the posting you have so helpfully deleted I 
pointed out that they used the wording from the English Bill of
Rights apparently changing what they understood by it and I
asked why then should we two hundred years later be bound by
what Keith Allan Schneider thinks they understood by it

 
 We have already looked in the dictionary to define the word  Isn't 
 this sufficient
 Since the dictionary said that a lack of mercy or an intent to
 inflict injury or grief counted as cruel sure
 
 People can be described as cruel in this way but punishments cannot

So one cannot say a cruel fate

Your prevarications are getting increasingly unconvincing I think

 According to Jerry Mander's In the Absence of the Sacred good
 book BTW the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy
 also played a significant role as a model for the US Constitution
 Furthermore apparently Marx and Engels were strongly influenced
 by a study of Iroquois society using it as the prime example of
 a successful classless egalitarian noncoercive society  Mander
 goes on to say that both the US and the USSR would do well
 to study the original document figure out where each went wrong
 and try to get it right next time

That's fascinating   I heard that the Chinese rather than

 Perhaps the chimps that failed to evolve cooperative behaviour
 died out and we are left with the ones that did evolve such
 behaviour entirely by chance
 
 That's the entire point

No that's the point of evolution not the point of natural
morality   Unless of course as I have suggested several
times already natural morality is just a renaming

 
 Are you going to proclaim a natural morality every time an
 organism evolves cooperative behaviour
 
 Yes
 
 Natural morality is a morality that developed naturally

But your yes is actually stronger than this    You are
agreeing that every time an organism evolves cooperative 
behaviour you are going to call it a natural morality

 What about the natural morality of bee dance

 Huh

Bee dance is a naturally developed piece of cooperative behaviour

  Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to
travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of   
infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

	Is this Zeno's Paradox Nothing can get out of a black hole because
the escape velocity is the speed of light I don't know how time dialation
can prevent matter spiraling in from getting to the event horizon Can any
one explain how matter gets in

	I hope that it was clear that a black hole can lose mass to its
surroundings via the socalled Hawking rediation This is the idea that
virtual partical pairs can form so close to the event horizen that one
of the pair is trapped and the other goes free The conservation of
energy requires that the black hole lose mass albeit very slowly that
that if primordial black holes were formed the ones about the size of
small asteriods should be evaporating about now in the history of our
universe The story goes that we should be able to see the flashes caused
by the explosions that result at the end of these black holes Does this
idea still hold promise or has it been debunked

  What I said was that people took time to copy the text correctly
  Translations present completely different issues

 
 So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had different
 versions of some OT texts   Did I misunderstand
 
 Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in
 the world  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of
 religion and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real
 story that is a bigger headline
 
 Let's back up to   At this point we have the Masoretic text the
 various targums translationscommentaries in aramaic etc and the
 Septuagint the ancient greek translation  The Masoretic text is the
 standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary  In some places it has
 obvious corruptions all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy
 These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and
 to the Septuagint

So when they took the time to copy the text correctly that includes
obvious corruptions

 
 Now the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars
 first it includes additional texts and second in some passages there are
 variant readings from the masoretic text in addition to fixingpredating
 the various corrupted passages  It must be emphasized that to the best of
 my knowledge these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars and
 have little theological import

So when they took the time to copy the text correctly that does not
exclude variant readings from the masoretic text which are of little 
theological import

 
 The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient copy of almost all of
 Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books  There
 is also an abundance of other material but as far as I know there is no
 sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha the extra texts in the
 septuagint  As far as analysis has proceeded there are also variations
 between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions  These tend to reflect the
 septuagint where the latter isn't obviously in error  Again though the
 differences thus far are not significant theologically  There is this big
 expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the
 material but so far this hasn't happened
 
 The DSS are important because there is almost no textual tradition in the
 OT unlike for the NT

Hey you're the expert

Evolution as I have said before is theory and fact  It is exactly

Andy

I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either  They are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make
Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model  Gravity too is
very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we call gravity  Gravity however is not 
a fact  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
behave in our physical environment  Newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force Einstein a wave Both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it  That takes a great 
leap of faith which of course is what religion takes  Evolution
is no different

 Faith and dogma are dangerous  

Faith and dogma are inevitable  Christians merely understand and admit
to the fact  Give me your proof that no God exists or that He does  
Whichever position you take you are forced to do it on faith  It does
no good to say you take no position for to show no interest in the 
existence of God is to assume He does not exist


stuff deleted

As many posters have said in as many posts lately this is just
not true  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no
faith at all  You make the presumption that the knowledge of the 
possibility of something is enough to require faith to render 
that possibilty of no interest  It is a very different thing to say
that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't
have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to 
think about  It's not either or  Sometimes is just something else
more interesting that occupies your mind  

I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable but not necessarily
applied to god and religion  It takes both faith and dogma to
expect the sun to come up every morning but there is overwhelming
reason every single day day in and day out for everyone to put 
his faith and dogma there  Not so with the christian religion

 And in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical

 Indeed I may  And one may be an atheist and also be gullible excitable
 and easily led
 
 I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates
 that a person is easily led   Whether they have a worship or belief 
 in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be
 beside the point
 
 Sure  But whether or not they are atheists is what we are discussing
 not whether they are easily led  

Not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible excitable

have to discuss if that concrete cause rather than atheism was the
factor that caused their subsequent behaviour

I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion but I disagree with
your reasoning  Faith  Bad  Dogma  Bad  Religion  Faith  Dogma
Religion  Bad  Bad  Religion  Bad  Unfortunately you never 
state why faith and dogma are dangerous  

Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on
faith alone which by its nature is without justification  That
is what I mean by the word faith'' belief without justification or
belief with arbitrary justification or with emotional irrational
justification

For example when someone says that God exists that they don't know
why they believe God exists they can just feel it that's faith

Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based
on new information or increased mental faculty

So Christians are totally irrational  Irrational with respect to their
religion only  What are you saying  One's belief in a Christian God does
not make one totally irrational  I think I know what you were getting at
but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject

Faith and dogma are irrational  The faith and dogma part of any religion
are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals  I claim that
faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion  If that
makes the much overused in this context Buddism a philosophy rather
than a religion I can live with that  Science is not a religion
because there is no faith nor dogma

A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind
whereas a Christian cannot due to the nature of faith and dogma present
in any religion

Again this statement is too general  A Christian is perfectly capable of
being a philosopher and absolutely capable of changing hisher mind  Faith in
God is a belief and all beliefs may change  Would you assert that atheists
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a
God which of course may show unfair bias when studying say religion

Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists  If a philosopher
is not an atheist she tends to be called a theologian

A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred  Christianity is
a special set of beliefs sanctioned by God himself and therefore
to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence
of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes  Faith comes into play  Dogma
comes into play  The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example
of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed
Sure interpretations of what God said'' are changed to satisfy the
needs of society but when God says something that's it  It was said
and that's that  Since God said it it is unflawed even if the
interpretations are flawed

Science as would be practiced by atheists in contrast has a
BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma
A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to
suit whatever is the best information available at the time AND
AND AND a scientist understands that any current beliefs
are deficient in some way  The goal is to keep improving
the beliefs  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect
the best information currently available  That's the only rational
thing to do  That's good philosophy

Can you see the difference  Science views beliefs as being flawed
and new information can be obtained to improve them  How many
scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding
of everything  Noneit would put them out of a job  Religion
views its beliefs as being perfect and the interpretations of
those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which
conflicts with them

Please explain how just because thinking kills people  And please
state more in your answer than Waco

It's easier for someone to kill a person when she doesn't require
a good rational justification of the killing  I don't consider
he's Jewish'' or he was born of Jewish parents'' or
this document says he's Jewish'' to be good rational justification

By the way I wasn't aware mass suicide
was a problem  Waco and Jonestown were isolated incidents  
Mass suicides are far from common

Clinton and the FBI would love for you to convince them of this
It would save the US taxpayer a lot of money if you could

Consider special relativity  It hasn't be proved nor has it been
disproved  No one has a proof one way or the other but many people
are interested in it
 
I've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the
existence of God one way or the other  The two possibilities
are supernaturalism and naturalism  Of course no set of circumstances can
be inconsistent with supernaturalism but similarly no set of circumstances
can be inconsistent with naturalism  In naturalism any phenomenon that
could be described as God is considered part of the natural world to
be studied as any other natural phenomenon gravity for instance  
For example if a loud godlike'' voice vociferously announced I
am God I exist and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity''
and if then gravity did indeed reverse a naturalist probably a scientist
would say Boy we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we
thought we did and that loud voice is something new  Perhaps we
didn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either''

I contend that proper implementation of the Christian faith requires
reasoning but that reasoning cannot be used to throw out things you
don't like or find uncomfortable  Hedonistic sexual behavior is 
condemned in the Bible and no act of true reason will make it any
less condemned  Hatred murder gossip all these are condemned
Is there Godordained murder in the Bible  You bet and if God ever
orders me to kill you I will  But I will first use the Gideonlike
behavior of verifying that God actually ordered the hit and will 
probably discuss it in an Abramlike fashion

I'm sure glad you don't know where I live since you don't seem
to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices
in your head and God's voice

I can hear you now this is how Jim Jones and David Koresh justify
their behavior  Delusional religious cults bear the same relationship 
to Christianity that rape bears to consentual sex form but no substance
When the Southern Baptist Church or the Methodist Church begin to do this
then you have reason to blame mainstream religion for the behaviors of these
people  Or should I associate every negative behavior I witness in any
nonChristian with you

You seem to have missed my point  Even if Jim Jones and David Koresh
were not religious people my point remains that faith and dogma
are dangerous and religion encourages them  Jim Jones and David Koresh
also encouraged them  My point does not rely on Jim Jones and David
Koresh being religious

Absolutely not true Without religion  either an established one or
one you invent for yourself  the theist and atheist are equally
not interested in God because without religious revelation there
is no information about God available Strip away the dogma and
the theistsatheists are no different simply holding a different
opinion on a matter of little practical importance

 Have you read the FAQ already

Benedikt

I can't recall anyone claiming that God makes anyone act a particlar
way I think that you're attempting to manufacture a contradiction
God is said to require certain behavior but the only compulsion is
the believer's sense of duty A standard of conduct does exist but we
are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever
ways we find convenient but our response to God's edicts can in no
way be used to question God's existence The behavior of believers is
a completely separate question from that of God's existence there is
nothing contradictory here

To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist is really
asking too much you would have existence depend on grammar All you
can really say is that something is poorly defined but that in itself
is insufficient to decide anything other than confusion of course

Your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief
than the object of belief may lead to a rat's nest of unnecessary
complexity I think I know what you're implying but I'd like to see
your version of this better alternative just the same

 Regardless of people's hidden motivations the stated reasons for many
 wars include religion  Of course you can always claim that the REAL

 fact remains that the justification for many wars has been to conquer
 the heathens

 If you want to say for instance that economics was the chief cause
 of the Crusades you could certainly make that point  But someone
 could come along and demonstrate that it was REALLY something else in
 the same manner you show that it was REALLY not religion  You could
 in this manner eliminate all possible causes for the Crusades

I don't have to make outrageous claims about religion's affecting and
effecting history for the purpsoe of aa all I have to do point out
that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate
atheism At no time have I made any statement that religion was the
sole cause of anything what I have done is point out that those who
do make that kind of claim are mistaken usually deliberately 

To credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to
misunderstand human nature the function of religion and of course
history I believe that those who distort history in this way know
exaclty what they're doing and do it only for affect

  This is a good point but I think average people do not take up Christianity
  so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their
  social life or to get more involved with American culture if they are kids of
  immigrants for example  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the
  Western World in some form or other it is simply the choice people take if
  they are bored and want to do something new with their lives but not somethong
  TOO new or TOO out of the ordinary  Seems a little weak but as long as it
  doesn't hurt anybody

 The social pressure is indeed a very important factor for the majority
 of passive Christians in our world today In the case of early Christianity
 the promise of a heavenly afterlife independent of your social status
 was also a very promising gift reason slaves and nonRomans accepted
 the religion very rapidly

If this is a hypothetical proposition you should say so if it's
fact you should cite your sources If all this is the amateur
sociologist subbranch of aa however it would suffice to alert the
unwary that you are just screwing around

This is fascinating Atheists argue for abortion defend homosexuality
as a means of population control insist that the only values are
biological and condemn war and capital punishment According to
Benedikt if something is contardictory it cannot exist which in
this case means atheists I suppose
I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war an
excellent means of controlling population growth or to capital
punishment I'm sorry but the logic escapes me
And why just capital punishment what is being questioned here the
propriety of killing or of punishment What is the basis of the
ecomplaint

Occam's Razor is not a law of nature it is way of analyzing an

what end 
It seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being
primitive simpleminded and unscientific antiintellectual and
childish and yet again condemned as being too complex Occam's

No I don't see what the popularity of a value has to do with whether
it is objective or not Pls explain
If almost all people agree that the sun exists in the usual uncritical sense
and almost all people agree that  a deal is bad  it's a reasonable 
conclusion that the sun really does exist and that the deal really is bad
I disagree completely Until rather recently most people did not
believe in evolution or the possibility of the atom bomb Popular
opinion is notoriously wrong about matters of fact
True but nevertheless the basis of all matters of fact is overwhelming
popular opinion and some overwhelming popular opinion is fact the
sun shines  If it were not so physics would be a personal matter
assumed to be different for each of us  There would be YourGravity and
MyGravity and no theoretical framework to encompass them and predict
both  
This is simply complete nonsense The basis for 'matters of fact' is
if any class of opinion the majority of INFORMED popular opinion
for some value of informed I would really hate to base my knowledge
of for instance QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is

about raw observations the dial reads  matter in other words though 
they can surely be mistaken or even lying there too I saw the statue 
move  Getting to theories from raw facts is certainly errorprone but
one assumes that the raw facts are usually as reported otherwise science
is impossible  
Opinions about 'raw facts' as you call them are somewhat different
than interpretations of those raw facts

Now I take an experience of goodevil to be every bit as raw a fact as an
experience of pain or vision
That might seem like a good first pass guess but it turns out to
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things because we all seem to
have rather different opinions experiences about what is good
and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says

  For me an ethical standard can be nothing
more than a hypothesis about the modification of observed value through
human actions It will be better if  You ought
See above We can't seem to agree on what's better

   In that context
then I see the choice as being between scepticism relativism and 
objectivism  IMO the existence of supermajority experiences of
good life freedom truth peace love intelligence testifies that
objectivism is true for fundamental values  and this in turn is weak 
evidence that objective ethics may be possible
I don't see that it's any evidence at all
As I point out above I'm really not interested very much in
what the popular opinion is I'm prepared to trustto some extent
the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation
because by and large they accord with my own However if everyone
else said the dial read  and it looked like a  to me I would
hope that I would believe myself Ie believing other people about
these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting
what I would believe if I observed myself but the possibility exists
that it is not Since I know from observation that others disagree
with me about what is good I believe I can discount popular opinion
about 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion
I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get
people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations
is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus actually

  I don't think I'm way off beam in saying that something is
better than nothing is a rational and objective valuation
Nope No tetanus is better than tetanus
I was referring to the situation at hand in which something is better than 
nothing  is a rational valuation for any disinterested observer not
making a general observation on all situations    But you knew that
No I didn't I assumed you were merely making a generalization
which you hadn't thought through very carefully You're not much of
a mindreader Frank
Nor are you it seems  cf I assumed above  
Perhaps true but I didn't make assertions about what you believed
You did

 While we're on the topic of books has anyone else noticed that Paine's
 The Age of Reason is hard to find  I've been wanting to pick up
 a copy for a while but not bad enough to mail order it  I've noticed
 though that none of the bookstores I go to seem to carry it  I thought
 this was supposed to be classic  What's the deal
 
 
   Me too  Our local used book store is the second largest on the
   West Coast and I couldn't find a copy there  I guess atheists
   hold their bibles in as much esteem as the theists

If I remember correctly Prometheus books have this one in stock
so just call them and ask for the book

This is the story of Kent the archetype Finn that lives in the 
Bay Area and tried to purchase Thomas Paine's Age of Reason This
man was driving around to Staceys to Books Inc to Well Cleanlighted
Place to Daltons to various other places

When he asked for this book the well educated American book store
assistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section
or then they said that his book has not been published yet but they
should receive the book soon In some places the assistants bluntly
said that they don't know of such an author or that he is not 
a well known living author so they don't keep copies of his books

Such is the life and times of America  years after the revolution


Cheers
Kent

 Sure
 
 If you employ X degree of force that's not moral but if you employ
 X degree of force but previously someone else has employed Y degree
 of force and the situation is thusandso that is moral
 
 Sure within the limits of what I know
 
 This is quite different from saying Employing force on other people
 is immoral period   Unfortunately from time to time we are obliged
 to do this immoral thing for reasons of selfpreservation and so
 we have to bear the moral consequences of that
 
 Since both statements to all intents and purposes say effectively
 the same thing 

Are you serious  Two statements one of which says that use of force
in the given situation is moral and the other of which says it is
not moral say effectively the same thing

Would you say this of any two statements one saying X is moral and
the other saying X is immoral   How would you decided when two 
statements X is moral X is immoral actually conflict and when
they say effectively the same thing

                  and lead one to do precisely the same thing then 
 either both statements are doublespeak or none

They might lead you to do the same thing but the difference is what
motivates pacifism so they obviously don't lead pacifists to to the
same thing

  Do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates
  the use of force
  
  With a few provisos yes  Minimum force for a start And it
  depends on what is being forced on either side   
  
  Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such
  people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing
  that our own actions in doing so are not moral
  
  My opinion is that our actions would be moral and it would be
  immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective  
  Again there many caveats and provisios
  
  Note my usage of my opinion is an admission that I don't have a lock
  on morals not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on
 
 You're admitting a lot more than that  You are admitting that
 your morals are situational   You are admitting that the actions
 of other people and the situation you are in help to determine
 how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions

 to do this immoral thing for reasons of selfpreservation and so
 we have to bear the moral consequences of that
 
 For what it's worth  and yes I know you claim to be an agnostic 
 it's this ability to relabel things from immoral to moral 
 that I find one of the least attractive qualities of the religious
 mind

 I think the application of computers to law has something to add to this
 discussion  My knowledge of this is limited to reading a few papers in
 it I had set my students an essay on the topic so I had to know enough
 to understand them
 
 Before I did my reading I was of the opinion that you could use a formal
 language to define laws and a formal system to decide whether they had
 been broken or not  In principle you could leave it up to humans to find
 out the lowerlevel facts and then just feed them in to the computer
 which would be able to pronounce judgement  Or so I thought
 
 From my reading I discovered that this is not yet possible and may not be
 possible in principle  The reason is that every case that comes to trial
 is unique with its own collection of special facts  It is beyond human
 power to specify all the possible circumstances that may bear upon a case
 in advance  We have to judge each one on its own merits and simply take
 the formal law as a guide  The law is an ass we must be careful to use
 it as a beast of burden and not expect anything more from it
 
 How does this apply to this discussion  It makes me suspect anything that
 claims to be and objective or absolute moral standard  If we had such a
 standard we'd be able to write it down unambiguously  Any such object
 must say this is right and that is wrong  yet that is exactly
 what research shows we can't do

Just as well then that I'm not claiming that my own moral system is
absolute

 I can produce a list of sufficient conditions for not owner which will 
 satisfy almost anyone  It's fairly clear who doesn't own the states  I 
 don't for example and nor do you   It's also clear that regardless of who 
 owns the states  is a bad deal in all plausible cases  So even in the 
 absence of an objective definition of owner though that is an interesting and
 important point which jon livesey has also raised about the word Freedom
 the conclusion stands

Now I'll raise the issue again in connection with Mr O'Dwyer's use
of the word plausible

I can plause all kinds of cases for example in which people 
actually own land but don't know that and so are willing to sell 
it in play for derisory sums only to find that they sold it for
real   Cases in which their mental capacity is imnpaired   Cases
in which they err about the true value of what they are selling

Pretty soon you have to start talking about informed owner
competent owner educated owner and so on and the concept
gets less and less clear and exceptions more and more plausible

But the real problem remains that of looking only at endpoints
in a context    Maybe most of us will agree with you that a pebble 
is small and that the Moon is big but that does not mean that
you have an objective measuring scale   Only that these two are 
fairly common opinions in context

An astronomer may claim that the Moon is actually tiny and
a microbiologist may remark that a pebble is huge   Similarly
if an armed Serbian offers a helpless Bosnian a dollar and his 
life for his land rather than killing him and taking it for free 
the Bosnian may consider that he is getting quite a good deal

 According to Jerry Mander's In the Absence of the Sacred good
 book BTW the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy
 also played a significant role as a model for the US Constitution
 Furthermore apparently Marx and Engels were strongly influenced
 by a study of Iroquois society using it as the prime example of
 a successful classless egalitarian noncoercive society  Mander
 goes on to say that both the US and the USSR would do well
 to study the original document figure out where each went wrong
 and try to get it right next time

That's fascinating   I heard that the Chinese rather than
the Italians invented pasta

That's fascinating  I take it that you're expressing skepticism
at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced
the Constitution of the people who stole their continent  You
could be right but it sounds plausible to me  Is there any
reason that you dismiss it outofhand  Here's some more

   Recent scholarship has shown that in the mids Indians were not
   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our founding
   fathers but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy
   arguably became the single most important model for the  Albany
   Plan of Union and later the Articles of Confederation and the
   Constitution  That this would be absent from our school texts
   and from history and from media is not surprising given the devotion
   Americans feel to our founding myth Great men gathered to express
   a new vision that has withstood the test of time  If it were
   revealed that Indians had a role in it imagine the blow to the
   American psyche
   
      By  when most of these men and others gathered to creat the
   Albany Plan of Union the first try at confederation they invited
   fortytwo members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors
   on confederate structures  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged
   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at
   Albany Congress It would be a strange thingif six nations
   of ignorant savagessic should be capable of forming such a union
   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted
   for ages and appears indissoluble and yet that a like union should
   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies
      According to Grinde Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs
   and congressional delegates in order to hammer out a plan that he
   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy

Grinde is Professor Donald GrindeJr of the University of California
at Riverside whose book The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the
American Nation addresses this issue

agrinoenkidumiccl Andres Grino Brandt asks about Mormons

There are some mention about events places or historical persons
later discovered by archeologist

One of the more amusing things in the BOM is a claim that a
civilization existed in North America aroun where the mystical plates
were found  Not only did it use steel and other metals but it had
lots of wars very OT  No one has ever found any metal swords or
and traces of a civilization other than the Native Americans

This is just one example

From Free Inquiry Winter   the following is an
introduction to the article Joseph Smith and the Book of
Mormon by George D Smith  The introduction is written by
Paul Kurtz 

	Mormonism  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints
	 claims a worldwide membership  million  It is one of
	the world's fastest growing religions with as many as
	 new converst in  alone  Because of the church's
	aggressive missionary program covering more than one
	hundred countries it is spreading even to third world
	countries
	
	Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and
	evangelical in preachment  The church is run along strict
	authoritarian lines  Led by a president who allegedly
	receives revelations directly form God and a group of
	twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief
	and practice the church is opposed to abortion
	pornography sexual freedom women's rights and other in
	its view immoral influences of secular society and it
	forbids the use of tobacco alcohol coffee and tea
	
	Centered in Salt Lake City the church is extremely wealthy
	and politically powerful in Utal and many other western
	states  Among wellknow presentday Mormons are Ezra Taft
	Benson former secretary of agriculture the Osmond family
	the Mariotts of the hotel empire and a score of highplaced
	government officials
	
	The Mormon church was founded in western New York in  by
	Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had
	found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill
	and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he
	had been able to translate the writing into the Book of
	Mormon the basis of Mormon belief  This book written by
	the commandment of God claims that the ancient Hebrews
	settled in America about  BCE and were the ancestors
	of the American Indians  Mormons believe that those who
	have been baptized in the true church will be reunited
	after death and that deceased nonMormon family members can
	be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the
	hereafter  Because of these beliefs Mormons have been
	considered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and
	as heretics by religious fundamentalists
	
	Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day  he was
	both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud  Because
	of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from
	Palmyra New York westward to Ohio and then to Illinois
	where in  he was shot to death by an agry mob  Brigham
	Young who reportedly had as many as eighty wives took over
	the leadership of the church and led the Mormons further
	westward to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City 
	Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of
	polygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice
	in nineteenthcentury America
	
	While other religions go back many centuries 
	Muhammadanism  years Christianity  and Judaism
	  and attempts to examine their beginnings are
	difficult extensive historical investigation of Mormon
	roots is possible  Some Mormons are willing to examine this
	history objectively bu others maintain that such scrutiny
	is dangerous to the faith
	
	In the following pages Free Inquiry presents two articles
	about the Mormon church  First George D Smith a lifelong
	member of the church provides a detailed critical
	examination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the Book of
	Mormon was divinely revealed  Second we present a portion
	of an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin also a
	Mormon since birth who questions the treatment of the
	history of the church by Mormon authorities  Paul Kurtz
	

The article itself is super

Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you will see
that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic

Why don't you cite the passages so that we can focus on some to discuss
Then following Jesus you can make fools of us and our logic

               If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
know more than you do now

Indeed if you can justifiably make this assertion you must be a
genius in logic and making fools of us should be that much easier

  the area on May rd  He has independent corroboration from
  several friends who apparently have had similar revelations  The
   quake was in fact in response to a request from the lot of
  them seeking a sign from god on the veracity of their visions

  None of this would be terribly interesting except for the amount
  of stir it has created in the area  Many many people are taking
  these claims very seriously  There are some making plans to be
  out of the are on the target date  My local religious radio
  station devoted  hours of discussion on the topic  

  I even called up during one of the live broadcasts to tell the
  host that he would have a full account of my conversion on May
  th provided my family and I survived the devastation and ruin
  that will invariably follow the quake

They said that Queens could stay they blew the Bronx away
and sank Manhattan out at sea



I know of a similar incident about  years ago  A climatologist Ithink 
that was his profession named Iben Browning predicted that an earthquake 
would hit the New Madrid fault on Dec  Some schools in Missouri that were 
on the fault line actually cancelled school for the day  Many people 
evacuated New Madrid and other towns in teh are  I wouldn't be suprised if 
there were more journalists in the area than residents  Of course teh 
earthquake never occured  HOw do I know about his  I used to live in 
Southern Illinois and the lican middle school was built directly on the 
fault line  No we still had school We laughed at the poor idiots who 
believed the prediction 

Bob if you're wanting an excuse to convert to Christianity you gonna have 
to look elsewhere

Hi

I don't know much about Mormons and I want to know about serious independent
studies about the Book of Mormon

I don't buy the 'official' story about the gold original taken to heaven
but haven't read the Book of Mormon by myself I have to much work learning
Biblical Hebrew I will appreciate any comment about the results of study
in style vocabulary placenames internal consistency and so on

For example There is evidence for onewriter or multiple writers
There are some mention about events places or historical persons later
discovered by archeologist

Yours in Collen

I don't think the Book of Mormon was supposedly translated from Biblical 
Hebrew  I've read that prophet Joseph Smith traslated the gold tablets 
from some sort of Egyptianish language

I don't think that the universe would look like a black hole from
the outside because that would imply that similar to a black hole we
would see stuff coming in from the outside

  Now that has always confused me  Once a black hole forms I don't see how
anything could pass the event horizon perhaps including the original mass that
formed is forming the black hole in the first place

  Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to
travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of   
infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

No it doesn't  Check again in any of the popular GR texts Misner
Thorne and Wheeler for example  It takes a finite proper time for
anything near the horizon to cross it if it's going to in the first
place and a finite proper time for anything crossing the horizon to
reach r

Q  How many Moslem men does it take to rape a woman
A  Five one to commit the act and four to witness the penetration


A guilty verdict can be rendered only if there is a confession or if there
are at least two male witnesses to the crime  Adultery and rape are proved
only if four witnesses have seen the actual penetration an occurrence that
presumably does not happen often

Is this from the Quran or however it's spelled

 Fred the problem with such reasoning is that for us nonbelievers
 we need a better measurement tool to state that person A is a

 no such tools and anyone could believe in a religion misuse its
 power and otherwise make bad PR It clearly shows the sore points
 with religion  in other words show me a movement that can't spin
 off Khomeinis Stalins Davidians Husseins 
 
 I don't think such a system exists  I think the reason for that is an
 condition known as free will  We humans have got it  Anybody using
 their freewill can tell lies and halftruths about any system and
 thus abuse it for their own ends

I don't think such tools exist either In addition there's no such
thing as objective information All together it looks like religion
and any doctrines could be freely misused to whatever purpose

This all reminds me of Descartes' whispering deamon You can't trust

 As for your question of moral freeagency given the Christian
 position above the freedom we have is to acknowledge God The
 morality we practice is a direct outgrowth of how we excercise that
 freedom You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to
 ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known
 in both cases That an atheist can't accept the evidence means only
 that he prefers not to accept it it says nothing about the evidence
 itself 

I agree I had a hard feeling not believing my grandgrand mother
who told me of elves dancing outside barns in the early mornings
I preferred not to accept it even if her statement provided

 From the point ov view of an atheist I see you claim Khomeini wasn't
 practicing true Islam  But I'm sure that he would have said the same about
 you  How am I a member of neither group supposed to be able to tell which
 one of you two is really a true Muslim

Fred Rice answered this already in an early posting
The problem with your argument is that you do not know who is a real
believer and who may be faking it  This is something known only by
the person himherself and God  Your assumption that anyone who
claims to be a believer is a believer is not necessarily true

In other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and
false Muslim We are back to square one Khomeini and Hussein are 
still innocent and can't be defined as evil or good Islamic 
worshippers

Mats Andtbacka writes

      Ah that old chestnut your claim that moral objectivism 
scientific objectivism I don't agree with it now try proving through
some objective moral test that my disagreeing is incorrect 
 
 Your claim which you have deleted now was not universal  not objective

      I've deleted it now in the interest of brevity Go back a step
and you'll see it was still in your post Yes that was my claim if you
can refute it then please do so

Firstly an apology  You hadn't deleted your claim and I was mistaken in
saying you had Sorry for any offence caused

Secondly  how can I refute your definition  I can only point up its
logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage
of the word objective in other areas  Indeed by your definition an
objective x is an oxymoron for all x  I have no quibble with that
belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly
good word

 So what is objective  Not the age of the universe anyway as I show
 above

      How many ages can the universe have and still be internally self
consistent I'd be amazed if it was more than one How many different
moral systems can different members of society have  indeed single
individuals in some cases  and humanity still stick together

Begging the question  People can have many opinions about the age
of the universe and humanity can still stick together   You are
saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about
it  Why

      The age of the universe like most scientific facts can be
emirically verified through means that'll give the same result no matter
who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the
largish side 

This assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality
which doesn't depend on what we think   Why should an extreme Biblical
Creationist give a rat's ass about the means of which you speak

I've heard of no way to verify morality in a
consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to
enlighten me

The same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted
to work with some accuracy better than a random guess  I wrote
elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value
If a moral system makes a prediction It will be better if
that can be tested and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction
This drug will relieve pain

      People's ideas about the age of object X are not objective
you can have any idea you like and I can't stop you Universae and
their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you
dislike some detail of them that's a problem with your opinion of
them 

Sure  Assume an objective reality and you get statements like this

I claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such
subjective and individual If I'm wrong then some moreorless
objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality
can you back up this positive claim of existence

Can you back up your positive claim above  No  That's because it's an
assumption  I make the same assumption about values on the basis
that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical
basis of the two is precisely the same

      Point Morals are in essence personal opinions Usually
ideally wellfounded motivated such but nonetheless personal The
fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question
sometimes even for the same reason does not make morals objective it
makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question
which can be good for the evolution of a social species
 
 And if a real large lot nice phrase of people agree that there is a 
 football on a desk I'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two  
 Perhaps you can explain the difference to me since you seem to see it
 so clearly

      Take a look on the desk  ie perform a test Iffootball THEN
accept theory ELSE DO Tell people they're hallucinating

      Now take a look at morality See anything If so please inform me
which way to look and WHY to look that particular way as opposed to
some other Get my drift

No Just look  Are you claiming never to know what good means

      Science is a whole other matter altogether
 
 Says you  Prove that those who disagree are wrong

      That's a simple matter of proving the track record of the
scientific method

I think it's great and should be applied to values  I may be completely
wrong but that's what I conclude as a result of quite an amount of
thought

 You're admitting a lot more than that  You are admitting that
 your morals are situational   You are admitting that the actions
 of other people and the situation you are in help to determine
 how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions
 
 Sure
 
 If you employ X degree of force that's not moral but if you employ
 X degree of force but previously someone else has employed Y degree
 of force and the situation is thusandso that is moral
 
 Sure within the limits of what I know
 
 This is quite different from saying Employing force on other people
 is immoral period   Unfortunately from time to time we are obliged
 to do this immoral thing for reasons of selfpreservation and so
 we have to bear the moral consequences of that
 
 Since both statements to all intents and purposes say effectively
 the same thing 

Are you serious  Two statements one of which says that use of force
in the given situation is moral and the other of which says it is
not moral say effectively the same thing

Yes when you tag on the Unfortunately  then to all intents and
purposes you are saying the same thing

Would you say this of any two statements one saying X is moral and
the other saying X is immoral   How would you decided when two 
statements X is moral X is immoral actually conflict and when
they say effectively the same thing

What they prescribe that one should do is a pretty good indicator

                  and lead one to do precisely the same thing then 
 either both statements are doublespeak or none

They might lead you to do the same thing but the difference is what
motivates pacifism so they obviously don't lead pacifists to to the
same thing

That's not true  You could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum 
force and still be a pacifist  If the minimum is  great   but one is
always trying to get as close to  force as possible under that belief
Not the same as 'force is immoral period' but still tending to pacifism

So that still leaves the door totally open for Khomeini Hussein
et rest They could still be considered true Muslims and you can't
judge them because this is something between God and the person

You have to apply your rule as well with atheistsagnostics you
don't know their belief this is something between them and God

So why the hoopla about Khomeini not being a real Muslim and the
hoopla about atheists being not real human beings

Bill I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism Lack of 
belief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding
transcendental values I hope you would accept the fact that 
for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to nonempirical
reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism

I think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might 
revise and fine tune your understanding of nonChristian systems

as a Lutheran having a lot of Christian friends and I even
have played in two Christian rock bands

So over to you do you have any counter claims sources et 
rest that shows that Christianity does not have the concept
of a social promise that is independent on the social status

 To credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to

However to underestimate the power of religion creating historical
events is also a big misunderstanding For instance would the
yearold war have ever started if there were no fractions
between the Protestants and the Vatican

 I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war an
 excellent means of controlling population growth or to capital
 punishment I'm sorry but the logic escapes me
 And why just capital punishment what is being questioned here the
 propriety of killing or of punishment What is the basis of the

I think a good book summarizing and comparing religions would be good

I confess I don't know of anyindeed that's why I checked the FAQ to see
if it had onebut I'm sure some alert reader does

I think the list of books suffers far too much from being Christian based
I agree that most of the traffic is of this nature although a few Islamic
references might be good but I still think an overview would be nice

One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions
is called Man's Religions by John B Noss  It was a textbook in a class
I had on comparative religion or some such thing  It has some decent
bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading

It doesn't compare religions directly but describes each one individually
and notes a few similarities  But nothing I have read in it could be even
remotely described as preachy or Christian based  In fact Christianity
mercifully consumes only  or so of its nearly  pages  The book is
divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began 
India East Asia Near East  There is nothing about New World religions
from the Aztecs Mayas Incas etc  Just the stuff people kill each
other over nowadays  And a few of the older religions snuffed out along
the way  

If you like the old stuff then a couple of books called The Ancient Near
East by James B Pritchard are pretty cool  Got the Epic of Gilgamesh
Code of Hammurabi all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods
were men  Essential reading for anyone who wishes to make up their own
religion and make it sound real good

 And in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical
 critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable and
 easily led on the other
 
 Indeed I may  And one may be an atheist and also be gullible excitable
 and easily led
 
 I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates
 that a person is easily led   Whether they have a worship or belief 
 in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be
 beside the point
 
 Sure  But whether or not they are atheists is what we are discussing
 not whether they are easily led  

Not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible excitable
and easily led from some concrete cause   In that case we would also
have to discuss if that concrete cause rather than atheism was the
factor that caused their subsequent behaviour

I'm not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour  merely that
it is not relevant to the definition of atheism which is 'lack of belief in 
gods'

In article CprvnInewscsouiucedu cobbalexialisuiucedu Mike Cobb writes
I'll yield the discussion on absolute morality until I can think of another way
to discuss it  If you're interested in a change here's an idea

	Do you believe in absolute morality And do you have absolute
knowledge Mere mortal you And if you claim that your God has absolute
knowledge then you have have absolute knowledge of that

	If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God and
in it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to but the prophets
no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals
then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word of
God have got it right Also you read their words in translation which
invariably introduces errors of nuance and usage and then how do you
know that you got the right message I assert that you do not and that
you do not have absolute knowledge of anything including absolute morals

	The only way you can assert such things is through appeal to
prejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a group
you have aligned yourself to

If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that 

	Because social pressure is the most powerful force known to
man How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness of
established religion is anything other than social convention One
way is to assert that there are moral universals But that is not
the same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origen
to trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties

What right do
we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality

	We expect empathy from our fellow man We expect to raise each
generation with values that we live by those which assure that mistakes
we have made are not repeated Do you think that mere authority checks
all tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life I think not In fact
authority is power and power corrupts The most powerful tend to think
that they are above the law that applies to everybody else Religious
authority theocarcy has not mitigated this any better than other
power structures on this score and it seems that because there are no
checks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abuses
recorded by history are greater

	We live and teach morals by setting an example starting in
the home This does not come from books or authority figures in
soceity If people are weak or confused at the present time it is
not because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by some
mysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulas
will repair That is but magical and simplistic thinking We need to
look at forces in the way we live even the good things that happen
in our present culture that are weakening the family as the primary
means we have to teach children values Of course people are trying
to have the community do things that once were done in the family
alone This may not be as effective We need to look at this

Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your brother and say
 that I was 
exercising my rights as I saw them was doing what felt good didn't want
anyone forcing their morality on me or I don't follow your morality 

	Laying down the law and with teeth doesn't stop the crazy
man from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law It
may help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact but it
may not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy people
from murduring

	It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianism
is in fact It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhat
isolated that do not experience change and have long standing
traditions In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisions
people have to make everyday In a real sense thay allow people to not
have to think That is OK when things are stable but it becomes a
problem when conditions change This leads me to think that morals are
not sumething fundemental at least most of them recalling that there
are values all people seem to agree on but mutate in response to outside
political economic technical and cultural influiences

	Lately I have come to regard people who speak like you
with great suspicion especially when they include the pharse for
the children I think that such people are more of an imparative to
want to  control what others do and think than other more nobil pursuits
such as of the truth

 False dichotomy  You claimed the killing were not religiously
 motivated and I'm saying that's wrong   I'm not saying that
 each and every killing is religiously motivate as I spelled out
 in detail
 
 Which killings do you say are religously motivated

For example I would claim that the recent assassination of four
catholic construction workers who had no connection with the IRA
was probably religously motivated

 At the time
 of writing I think that someone who claims the current violence is
 motivated by religion is reaching

What would you call is when someone writes The killings in NI 
are not religously motivated

I'd say it was motivated by a primitive notion of revenge and by
misguided patriotism  Otherwise I'd have to wonder how come mainland
catholics are not killed by mainland protestants and southern
catholics are not killed by southern protestants and so on  Take away
all plausible causes bar religion and the violence diminishes markedly
Gee why is that

 Now it's possible to argue that 
 religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in
 the present but I don't know of any evidence that this is so  and I'm
 not enough of a historian to debate it 

Given that the avowed aim of the IRA is to take Northern Ireland
into a country that has a particular church written into its 
constitution and which has restriction on civil rights dictated
by that Church I fail to see why the word past is appropriate

The country also has a different official language written in its
constitution and vice versa   maybe they're motivated by a love of 
Irish poetry  Your argument is fallacious jon

For what it's worth I agree with all that you say about Ireland above 
and more

 	I wonder if the Universe would look like a Black Hole
 from outside How could we posit an Outside whether called
 DeSitter space hyperspace parallel universes whatever
  
 I don't think that the universe would look like a black hole from
 the outside because that would imply that similar to a black hole we
 would see stuff coming in from the outside

   Now that has always confused me  Once a black hole forms I don't see how
 anything could pass the event horizon perhaps including the original mass 
 that formed is forming the black hole in the first place

   Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever 
 faster towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space 
 caused by the excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon 
 it has further to travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the 
                                                            
When you look into the math of the different possible frames of reference
you will find out that this time is not physically relevant

 event horizon of   
 infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

 No it doesn't  Check again in any of the popular GR texts Misner
 Thorne and Wheeler for example  It takes a finite proper time for
                                                 
The relevant time for the falling object

 anything near the horizon to cross it if it's going to in the first
 place and a finite proper time for anything crossing the horizon to
 reach r
         center of the hole where the evil singularity lurks

There is NO singularity at the horizon  The appearance that there is one
comes from attempting to use a coordinate system that doesn't map properly
physically in this geometry rather analogous to the singularity at
the North and South Poles of the Earth when using Latitude and Longitude
lines  Such singular behavior as the earlier post suggested infinite
time to reach the horizon is a mathematical artifact of the wrong choice
of coordinates  As Paul says in the object's frame of reference
it WILL hit the horizon in finite time and then plunge to the singularity
that IS a real singularity in a short for small holes further finite 
amount of time

Not only that but to an OUTSIDE observer an object that falls into a black
hole disappears in a finite time also in spite of the relativistic slow
down that intuition suggests  This is because any light emitted by the
object as it falls or is shone onto it by a separate flashlight consists
of individual FINITE quanta and only a finite number of these can reach
the object before it plunges through the horizon  These will be succesively
more redshifted true but only a finite number of them will hit the object
and following ones will be too late to interact with the object until they
too are inside the horizon and thus cannot come out

This reddening dimming and disappearance is exponentially fast as the object 
approaches the horizon when you do the math

As Paul says this is discussed in Misner Thorne and Wheeler's book 
Gravity where they talk about the appropriatness sp of the term black 
hole and the inappropriatness sp of an older term frozen star which 
was used earlier in this century before all the implications of blackhole 
theory were understood  Do not let the math deter you from looking at this 
book it's got a lot of good prose discussions of this material in between 
the equations that is VERY good reading IMHO

Of course it's all just THEORY

 I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either  They are extremely useful
 mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make
 Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model  Gravity too is
 very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected but we
 have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
 objects by this thing we call gravity  Gravity however is not 
 a fact  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
 behave in our physical environment  Newton thought gravity was a
 simple vector force Einstein a wave Both are very useful models that 
 have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
 want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
 the way the theory now formulated talks about it  That takes a great 
 leap of faith which of course is what religion takes  Evolution
 is no different

Perhaps the major difference here is that we notice something which we call
gravity and then do some modelling around it  I myself do not notice any
deity  Hence a model cannot be made  A deity is an abstract and hence
religion may be considered a model of an abstract

Besides we can always change the model of gravity if the one we have doesn't
work too well  Can you imagine this with the bible  Erm excuse me I bought
this about  years ago and it doesn't seem quite rightcan I have an
improved model please

God is the One Who created the night the day the sun and the moon

The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr Maurice Bucaille is that
while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time and for
a long time afterwards there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse
or anywhere in the Qur'an

 
Well that is certainly different but it looks as if there is a translation

And if a real large lot nice phrase of people agree that there is a
football on a desk I'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two
Perhaps you can explain the difference to me since you seem to see it
so clearly

rest deleted

That's a fallacy and it is not the first time it is pointed out

It's not a fallacy  note the IF   IF a supermajority of disinterested people
agree on a fundamantal value we're not doing ethics YET Benedikt then what
is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial
observation

 
The reference to it's not yet being ethics is dubious You have used the terms
absolute objective and others interchangeably Same with moral values values
at all worth measuers and usefulness You infer from them as if they were
the same
 
To the IF When the If is not fulfilled your intermission is a waste of time
Assuming that you don't intend this it is reasonable to conclude that you
want to argue a point
 
You have made a interesting statement here namely that of the disinterested
observer There is no such thing in morals Probably the shortest proof for
objective and morality being a contradiction
 
 
For one you have never given a set of morals people agree upon Unlike
a football Further you conveniently ignore here that there are
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something The analogy
does not hold

I have however given an example of a VALUE people agree on and explained
why  People will agree that their freedom is valuable  I have also
stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective
ethics  the IF assertion above  And that is what I'm talking about there
isn't a point in talking about ethics if this can't be agreed

 
Fine And that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon I could
name quite a lot of people who state the opposite Not that that wasn't
mentioned before In other words you have nothing to fulfill your strong
claims with
 
 
One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football
while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
with a set of morals YOU have to give

I'm not doing morals ethics if we can't get past values  As I say
the only cogent objection to my 'freedom' example is that maybe people
aren't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable
Maybe not and I want to think about this some especially the implications
of its being true

 
Clutching a straw I don't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were
loaded terms are fixpoints Those who deny the morality of freedom make quite
clear what they say their practice is telling Yes there are even those who
are willingly unfree It is quite common in religions by the way For one
there is a religion which is named Submission
 
Don't even try to argue that submission is freedom
 
 
Further the above is evidence not proof Proof would evolve out of testing
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories

Garbage  That's not proof either

 
If it were so it would argue my case But I am afraid that that is considered
proof
 
 
The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer
the objections Evidence that you are a preacher

Name that fallacy
 
There is something universally valued in a moral context

 I hope an Islamic Bank is something other than BCCI which

deletions

BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank 
what will someone bet me they weren't real Islamic owners and
operators  and yet it actually turned out to be a longrunning
and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often
quite naive depositors

An Islamic Bank is something which operates in a different fashion to
your modern bank as I have explained here on another thread before
For example Islamic banks don't pay fixed interests on deposits but a
return on investments which varies according to the market and is not
fixed like interest is

Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world
There are no Islamic banks in the West including the USA to my
knowledge  I doubt if the market for them exists there  at least not
while Islamic banks are at a relatively early stage of their
development as is the case now  BCCI is most certainly not an Islamic
bank  did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits  If the
answer to this question is yes then BCCI was not an Islamic bank as
Islamic banks are specifically set up to not pay or charge interest

Whether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely
irrelevant

This is the most unmitigated bilge I've seen in a while Jim Brown obviously
has possession of the rightwing token

 Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective

In December former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told a
Senate committee that sanctions were costing Iraq  million per day and
that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world
Iraq he suggested was losing badly every day it defied the UN demands
while the community of nations won every day  with no taking of life or
loss of life   FCNL Washington Newsletter

 The world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect  Many
 innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others  It it regretable
 but that's TheWayItIs

Wrongful actions of murderers like leaders of the US government perhaps
Regrettable of course TheWayItIs  certainly not

 The media is not totally monolithic  There are even conservative
 sources out there if you know where to look  Hurrah for Rush

Good heavens An escapee from Rush Limbot Land Conservative my ass

 And BTW the reason I brought up the blanketbombing in Germany was 
 because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being 
 so deplorable  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing 
 wasn't accurate enough to hit industrialmilitary targets in a 
 decisive way by any other method at that time  But in the Gulf War 
 precision bombing was the norm

BULLSHIT In the Gulf Massacre  of all ordnance used was smart The
rest  that's   was just regular dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff Have
you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch
was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage Or that a
successful interception of a Scud was defined as the Patriot and Scud
passed each other in the same area of the sky

And of the  that was the smart stuff  hit Again  try to follow me
here  that means  of this smart arsenal missed

                                                       The stories
 of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk

Prove it I have a source that says that to date the civilian death count
er excuse me I mean collateral damage is about 

s

   No one has attempted to calculate the costs of an execution in
Washington state but studies elsewhere suggest it costs far more than
incarceration
   California is spending more than  million annually on capital cases
and until this year hadn't executed anyone since   Texas the national
leader in the number of executions spends an estimated  million per
execution  That compares to an average cost of incarceration in Washington
state of  per maximumsecurity prisoner per year

What about the land mines which have already been mentioned

I asked around in one of the areas you suggested yourself and presented
the information I got  No mention of US landmines was given

 other countries like Kuwait  Information is hard to prove  You are
 claiming that the US sold information  Prove it    Information
 is hard to prove almost certainly if the US did sell information then that
 fact is classified and you can't prove it

Oh very neat  Dismiss everything I say unless I can prove beyond a shadow

mathew

Okay so you are going to blindly believe in things without reasonable
evidence  I didn't realize you were a theist  I am doubting a claim
presented without any evidence to support it  If you are able to present
real evidence for it then great  But unsupported claims or even claims
by such and such news agency will not be accepted  If you want to
stick to the sheer impossible instead of the merely difficult then
fine  

The statement that if such a fact is classified then you 
can't prove it is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law  If you 
have access to classified information that you know to be classified
and you reveal it there is a good chance that you or someone else 
the person who revealed it to you is going to jail  

I never said that you couldn't prove it to my satisfaction I merely
said that it was difficult  Who said I try and make things easy
for people I am arguing with  Unless of course they need the

Thanks Jon  I had forgotten about the  and  invasions if I had

I stand corrected  Thanks

 
    Panama we invaded true twice this century 
 
 The US created Panama in the first place by fomenting and then

 US troops landed in Colombia to help with the uprising and then
 Colombia was duly dismembered and replaced by two countries in

       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you don't want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony  
 
Bill I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert  By biblical scholar I mean
an expert who in the course of his or her research is willing to let the
chips fall where they may  This excludes literalists who may otherwise be
defined as biblical apologists  They find what they want to find  They are
not trustworthy by scholarly standards and others
 
Why an insert  Read it  I have a number of times  The passage is glaringly
out of context and Josephus a superb writer had no such problem elsewhere 
in his work  The passage has nothing to do with the subject matter in which 
it lies  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears

I think this is a weak argument  The fact is there are two references to
Jesus in Antiquities of the Jews one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians  Origen wrote in the third century that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah while the long passage
says the opposite  There is an Arabic manuscript of Antiquities of the
Jews which contains a version of the passage which is much less gungho
for Jesus and may be authentic
   There is no question that Origen in the third century saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus  There are no manuscripts of Antiquities which
lack the references

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted but
I don't think it's very likelynor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case I know GA Wells takes
this position but that's because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed  And he is a professor of German not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus

Jim Lippard              LippardCCITARIZONAEDU

Evidently Jim thinks I am arguing an existence' issue  It should be clear 
from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only 
to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim  The argument against the
messiah claim is not weak maybe mine is but in the hands of pros it is not

There are indeed two passages  The short one cannot be used to validate the
messiah claim imo  That's why I refered to the long which can be used  It 
flatly states Jesus was the Christ and mentions the crucifixion 
resurrection and Christian belief in said claims

The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother   brother of
Jesus who was called the Christ  emphasis mine and that's it 
If original Josephus has merely reported what some people say  It is nothing 
more than an observation one which lacks the Christian fundamentals

The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons  its way out of
context  Origen evidently knew nothing of it and  its rather inconsistent
with the short  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as 
insert and I see Jim agrees  Consensus is usually reflected subtly as in
Elaine Pagel's Gnostic Gospels p  A comment attributed to Josephus
reports emphasis mine  As for  I mentioned in my original post that 
the long is a rd century insert more properly postOrigen as Jim notes

There may not be consensus on the short  The text which discusses James in a
legal role stands with or without it  That it does not upset context makes it
difficult to argue insert  On the other hand an inpassing insert is easily
disguised in any context  Nonetheless on historiographical grounds it is 
worthless for the messiah defense and that's why I didn't mention it 

I don't know about the Arabic ms  If you have a translation reference Jim
please let me know  As for its much less gungho tone obviously the date 
of this ms is critical  If after ca AD  a watereddown entry in lieu 
of removal can be easily explained

  And in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical
  critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable and
  easily led on the other
  
  Indeed I may  And one may be an atheist and also be gullible excitable
  and easily led
  
  I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates
  that a person is easily led   Whether they have a worship or belief 
  in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be
  beside the point
  
  Sure  But whether or not they are atheists is what we are discussing
  not whether they are easily led  
 
 Not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible excitable
 and easily led from some concrete cause   In that case we would also
 have to discuss if that concrete cause rather than atheism was the
 factor that caused their subsequent behaviour
 
 I'm not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour  merely that
 it is not relevant to the definition of atheism which is 'lack of belief in 
 gods'  

Throw away the FAQ   We can all just ask Mr O'Dwyer since he can
define the thing that the rest of us only talk about

 Mathew I agree  This it seems is the crux of your whole position
 isn't it  That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him arms
 to fight Iran  I agree  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those
 who did or do  But we did sell arms to Hussein and it's a done deal
 Now he invades Kuwait  So do we just sit back and say Well we sold
 him all those arms I suppose he just wants to use them now  Too bad
 for Kuwait  No unfortunately sitting back and letting things be
 is not the way to correct a former mistake  Destroying Hussein's
 military potential as we did was the right move  But I agree with
 your statement Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to
 sell arms to Hussein

But it's STILL HAPPENING  That's the entire point  Only last month John
Major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of
arms to Saudi Arabia  The same month we sold jet fighters to the same
Indonesian government that's busy killing the East Timorese

I heard about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia  Now how is it such a grave
mistake to sell Saudi Arabia weapons  Or are you claiming that we shouldn't
sell any weapons to other countries  Straightforward answer please

It's all very well to say Oops we made a booboo better clean up the
mistake but the US and UK keep making the same mistake  They do it so
often that I can't believe it's not deliberate  This suspicion is reinforced
by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit
economy reliant on arms sales

Who benefits from arms sales  Hint it isn't normally the gov't  It is
the contractor that builds that piece of equipment  Believe it or not
the US and UK don't export the huge quantities of arms that you have
just accused them of doing  Arms exports are rare enough that it
requires an act of congress for nonsmall arms to most countries if
not all  Do you believe in telling everyone who can do what and who
can sell their goods to whom

 Now I do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter
 how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law  If someone tells me
 Islam says such and such I immediately say show me the support for
 this statement from the Qur'an and Sunnah  I believe this to be my
 Islamic duty for according to one hadith of the Prophet peace and
 blessings of God be with him if your leader tells you to enter a fire
 and you do it and kill yourself then you have sinned for doing 
 wrong even though you
 were blindly following the instructions of your leader  I am
 responsible for my own actions not Abu Hanifa or Imam Malik etc
 even if I am blindly following the opinions of Abu Hanifa etc
 
 With this in mind to my understanding we must look at the reasoning
 behind such opinions of Muslims that support Khomeini's fatwa  Now to
 my understanding the hadith upon which those who support Khomeini's
 fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war
 time  Now brother in general it is IMHO ridiculous and wrong to say
 that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of
 peace  I think any sensible human being can see this so I personally
 think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty
 for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace
 regarding this particular subject
 
 If you think I am wrong please feel free to say so with your
 reasoning from Qur'an and hadith please  Not because somebody said
 so I want the reasoning from AlQur'an and the sahih hadiths
 
 Perhaps we should take our discussion to socreligionislam  Please
 email me Rashid if you think we should do this
  
 By the way I also disagree with your opinion regarding the punishment
 for apostasy  The viewpoint I follow  that there is in general no
 punishment for apostasy  is very strongly supported by Qur'an and
 hadith  This is very well shown in the book Punishment in Islamic Law
 by Mohamed S ElAwa American Trust Publications 
 

I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little
justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an
In Islamic history as well apostasy has rarely been punished 
Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there
is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostates have
been generally left to believe or not believe as they will

However when an apostate makes attacks upon God and
His Messenger the situation changes Now the charge of
apostasy may be complicated with other charges  perhaps 
charges of sedition treason spying etc If the person 
makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public
attacks as opposed to arguement against Islam the
situation is likewise complicated If the person spreads
slander or broadcasts falsehoods again the situation
changes The punishments vary according to the situation
the apostate is in Anyhow the charge of aggravated
apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case

There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation
and being in the situation where someone unilaterally
wages war by their actions creates disorder makes mischiefetc 
against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm 
to Muslims Here a small group or even a single individual could
be said to be engaged in such a practise In other words there is
a clear difference between a formal war situation where two
clearly defined parties wage war conclude treaties exchange
prisoners etc and dealing with attacks that come from isolated
individuals or groups against Islam It is the second situation 
the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that 
would apply in the case of Rushdie

The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an 
offensive book banning the book is secondary 
a full set of circumstances following the publication of
the book come into play as well including the deaths of many
Muslims and Rushdie's and his publishers Media games


 Now I do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter
 how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law  If someone tells me
 Islam says such and such I immediately say show me the support for
 this statement from the Qur'an and Sunnah  I believe this to be my

 even if I am blindly following the opinions of Abu Hanifa etc

Now to
 my understanding the hadith upon which those who support Khomeini's

 think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty
 for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace
 regarding this particular subject

I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above I believe
that one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 
Every verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding circumstance of
revelation but in no way is the understanding the tafsir of the
verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance
in which it was revealed If this was the case then we could say
that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the
Muslims were NOT involved in conflict should be suspended when
they were at war The logic does not follow In complex reallife
situations there may be many verses and many hadiths which can
all be related to a single complicated situation The internal
relationships between these verses may be quite complex such that
arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how
each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task
It is not necessarily a simple this or that process There may
be many parameters involved there may be a larger context in
which a particular situation should be viewed All these matters
impinge on the situation

In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an
The Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses but this reflection must
entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith
If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety then each
person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that
However if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to
the
State to the gestation of laws and rulings to the gestation of society
the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there 
are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one 
should achieve Jaffar Ibn Muhammad asSadiqas relates some of 
these requirements as taught by the ProphetSA in a hadith

he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating
verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one
and a decisive from an ambiguous and does not differentiate between
a permission and an obligation and does not recognize a verse of
Meccan period from a Medinite one and does not know the circumstances 
of revelation and does not understand the technical words of
the Qur'an whether simple or compound and does not comprehend the
knowledge of decree and measure and is ignorant of advancing and
delaying in its verses and does not distinguish the clear from
the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning
from the termination and is unaware of the question and the answer
the disjoining and the joining and the exceptions and the allinclusive
and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the
subsequent one and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the
detailed one the obligatory laws and the permissions the places of the
duties and rules and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful and
does not know the joined words and the words that are related to those
coming before them or after them  then such a man does not know
the Qur'an nor is he among the people of the Qur'an

Based on these and other hadiths and in accordance with many Qur'anic
verses Why should not a company from every group remain behind 
to gain profound understanding tafaqquh in religion and to warn 
people when they return to them so that they may beware 
a science of jurisprudence arose The requirements
for a person to be considered a mujtahid one who can pronounce on
matters of law and religion are many I've listed a few major 
divisions below  there are of course many subdivisions within these
headings

 Knowledge of Arabic syntax conjugation roots semantics oratory
 Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir
 Logic mantiq
 A knowledge of Hadiths
 A knowledge of transmitters rijal
 Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence Qur'an Sunnah Consensus
Reasoning

The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves
 discussion of imperatives awamir
 discussion of negative imperatives nawahi
 discussion of generalities and particularities aam wa khas
 discussion of unconditional and conditional
 discussion of tacit meanings
 discussion of the abstract and the clear
 discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated

The principles of Application of the law involves
 principles of exemption
 principles of precaution
 principles of option
 principles of mastery

The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process
in pronouncing judgement on a given situation It is not a matter
of looking at one verse and one hadith 

Now no one should blindly follow anyone but there is a difference
between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is
clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself There is the
famous hadith of the Prophet SA in which he says
The fuqaha religious scholars are the trustees of the Prophet as 
long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires pleasures
and wealth of this world The Prophet SA was asked O Messenger
of God How may we know if they so concern themselves He SA replied
By seeing whether they follow the ruling power If they do that fear for
your religion and shun them I do not yet know enough about the Imams
of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies
to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them

The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as The fortress of Islam My only
point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into
play a certain amount of expertise  the specifics of this expertise is 
delineated in the Qur'an and hadith Those who acquire this expertise
are praised in both the Qur'an and hadith  those who without the requisite
knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society state and religion 
are cautioned

The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this
group is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that is
apostasy was wrong When one discusses something they should at least
base their discussion on fact Secondly Khomeini was condemned as a
heretic
because he supposedly claimed to be infallible  another instance of
creating a straw man and then beating him

 Perhaps we should take our discussion to socreligionislam  Please
 email me Rashid if you think we should do this

I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup
Unfortunately
I do not have any access to email so private discussion or a moderated
group
is out of the question I cannot post to a moderated group like
socreligionislam How about socculturearabic or talkreligionmisc

about my reply

 Diplomatic 

It a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming Usenet diplomacy
is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through isn't it

 I realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument so I'll try to
 explain why I feel a mind is necessary 

Kevin unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little
about algorithms Your reasoning as I see it is very much along the
lines of Roger Penrose who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannot
be algorithmic in his book The emperor's new mind Concerning
computers minds and the laws of physics However Penrose's
claim that he has mathematical insight or your similar claim
that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look
could be just illusions

We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints  I try to ponder
on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective
realising that it might not be anything special but certainly
useful Thinking back of what I wrote do you think worms have minds
or not They are able to experience pain at least they behave 
just like that Yet it is conceivable that we might some day
in the future perform a total synthesis of C elegans from
the elements Would such a worm have a mind

 Firstly I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms They're
 great at solving problems once the method has been worked out but not
 at working out the method itself

This is true to some extent However I do not think that our brains
work like computers at all In fact there is substantial evidence
Skarda  Skarda  Freeman  that brains work more or less
chaotically generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve
Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators I suppose

 the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered Does
 this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already
 preprogrammed into our brains This is somewhat unlikely given that
 our brains ultimately are encoded in  chromosomes worth of genetic
 material much of which isn't used

Indeed this is extremely unlikely given the vast impact of nurture
on our mind and brain I suggest however that before trying to
understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms 

Kevin take a look at the references I mentioned and think again
I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind
are neurologists neuropsychologists and biologists but do not 
flame me for my opinions since they study beings that are
conscious 

The reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot
lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different

And please do not bring QM into this discussion at all  not
all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness
plays some special role in physics I would say it doesn't

 The other problem with algorithms is their instability Not many
 algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet
 people survive strokes without going completely haywire there are
 sideeffects but patients still seem remarkably stable Also
 neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate 
 can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's
 code

Again brains are not computers Don't forget this This does not
mean they need something else to work  they just work differently
Their primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action 
selfawareness and high intelligence are later appearances

 The next problem is the sticky question of What is colour replace
 'colour' with the sensation of your choice Presumably the
 materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of
 chemical reaction The usual products of such a reaction are energy 
 different chemicals Is colour a mixture of these

You are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in
our brains somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical This is
not how I see it The sensation 'green' is a certain timedependent
pattern in the area V of our visual cortex and it is distributed
with the help of areas V and V to the rest of the brain 

Indeed a firing pattern I have sometimes thought of our consciousness
as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns
but this is just idle speculation

Scientific American's September  issue was a special issue on
mind and brain Have you already read it from cover to cover 
There are two articles on visual perception so you might be 
interested

But again please note that subjective experiences cannot be 
observed from a thirdperson perspective If we see nothing but 
neuronal activity we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the
mind

Kalat  writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation
of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the 
patients' state of mind For instance a patient whose septal area
was stimulated without his knowledge by remote control during
a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression and
started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend

Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing
situations when the patients have started flirting with the
therapist

In conclusion there is evidence that

 brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences 
   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage

 conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in
   various areas of brain  when we think of colours our
   visual cortex is activated etc

 consciousness is an afterthought  we become conscious of our
   actions with a half a second delay and our brains are ahead
   of our 'conscious will' by at least  ms 

Thus I think it is fruitful to turn the question Why do 'I' see
colours around and ask What is this 'I' that seems to be 
observing since it seems that our conscious mind is not
the king of our brains

 If this is so a
 computer won't see colour because the chemistry is different Does an
 algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an
 equivalent that doesn't It shouldn't because the outputs of each
 algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances So why do
 we see colour

This depends on what is meant by 'seeing colours' Does a neural
network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from
 to  see the numbers if it is capable of sorting them

If you are asking why does an animal who is conscious of itself
as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who
doesn't I have a good answer  read my previous posting
where I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap
roles and act more morally so that they don't unconsciously
kill each other with newly discovered weapons A bit extreme
but this is the basic idea

When early Homo became more and more efficient in using tools 
a sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in
line with this development Indeed respect for others and 
conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages
for social animals such as early humans 

 If I remember correctly quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction
 with two processes acting on it The first process has been called
 'Unitary Evolution' or 'U' is governed by Schroedinger's equation
 and is well known The second process called various things such as
 'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' or 'R'
 and is more mysterious It is usually said to occur when a
 'measurement' takes place although nobody seems to know precisely
 when that occurs When it does occur the effect of R is to abruptly
 change the wavefunction

If minds are required for this does this mean that until human
minds came to the scene wavefunctions never collapsed but remained
in the superpositions for aeons My how powerful we are

This has been discussed before and I think this topic is irrelevant
since we do not agree that minds are necessary and neither do
physicists 

 Anyway I'm speculating that minds would be in part X There seems to
 be some link between consciousness and R in that we never see linear
 superpositions of anything although there are alternative
 explainations for this I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access
 part X but since this is only speculation that won't matter too
 much  My main point is that there might be a place for minds in
 physics

I agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above  physics
needs sharp minds to solve many real problems 

 I'll go back to my nice padded cell now if that's OK with you 

It's OK if you don't forget to take with you the references I
wrote about in my previous posting plus the following

I'm sure there are many people who work with neural networks and

what you expect

 I am not saying that NNs will solve all such problems but I think
 they show that it is not as hard as you think to come up with
 mechanical models of consciousness

explain why I feel a mind is necessary 

Firstly I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms They're

As a specific example I like to solve numerical crosswords not the
simple dothesumsandinserttheanswers type the hard ones To do
these with any efficiency you need to figure out a variety of tricks
Now I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles but
in doing so you have to work out the tricks yourself and program
them into the computer You can of course 'obfuscate' the trick and
write the program so that it is uncovered but as far as I can see
the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered Does
this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already
preprogrammed into our brains This is somewhat unlikely given that
our brains ultimately are encoded in  chromosomes worth of genetic
material much of which isn't used

One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation but
again as far as I can see this still has an air of 'if you see
object X then perform action Y' and we don't seem to get anywhere
The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see and what
conclusions to draw from it's experience

The other problem with algorithms is their instability Not many
algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet

However such a view is actually a nonsolution How should minds be
able to act as observers feel pain and pleasure and issue
commands any better than the brain Moreover how do the interactions
occur

A bit of idle speculation

'measurement' takes place although nobody seems to know precisely
when that occurs When it does occur the effect of R is to abruptly
change the wavefunction

I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something
else' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X' It seems reasonable
to assume that something causes R although that something might be
the wavefunction itself in which case part X is simply the
wavefunction Note though that we'd need more than U to explain R

Anyway I'm speculating that minds would be in part X There seems to

Ignoring the challenge  He ignores the challenge that extreemists for

This is the most unmitigated bilge I've seen in a while Jim Brown obviously
has possession of the rightwing token

 Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective

In December former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told a
Senate committee that sanctions were costing Iraq  million per day and
that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world
Iraq he suggested was losing badly every day it defied the UN demands
while the community of nations won every day  with no taking of life or
loss of life   FCNL Washington Newsletter

As I understand that number is deceptive  The reason is that the money
cost was in nonoil sales for the most part  Iraq still is not allowed
to sell oil or do many of the things under the initial sanctions but
is still surviving

 And BTW the reason I brought up the blanketbombing in Germany was 
 because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being 
 so deplorable  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing 
 wasn't accurate enough to hit industrialmilitary targets in a 
 decisive way by any other method at that time  But in the Gulf War 
 precision bombing was the norm

BULLSHIT In the Gulf Massacre  of all ordnance used was smart The
rest  that's   was just regular dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff Have
you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch
was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage Or that a
successful interception of a Scud was defined as the Patriot and Scud
passed each other in the same area of the sky

Of the  I have heard figures closer to  but I won't quibble your
figures most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by
enemy troops  A B drops a lot of bombs in one sortie and we used them
around the clock  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb
munitions  

  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse  The adjusted figures for number
of Patriot kills of SS derivitives is   That figure came
not from some fluke in the Pentagon but a someone working with such
stuff in another part of DoD

  The statement precision bombing was the norm is true around areas
where civilians were close to the target  We dropped by tonnage very
little bombs in populated regions explaining the figures  

And of the  that was the smart stuff  hit Again  try to follow me
here  that means  of this smart arsenal missed

This figure is far below all the other figures I have seen  If it
is indeed accurate then how do you explain the discrepancy between
that figure and other figures from international organizations
Most figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to  which is 
still far higher than your   Or does your figure say a bomb
missed if the plane took off with it and the bomb never hit the target
regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped  Such methods
are used all the time to lie with statistics

                                                       The stories
 of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk

Prove it I have a source that says that to date the civilian death count
er excuse me I mean collateral damage is about 

I have never seen any source that was claiming such a figure  Please
post the source so its reliability can be judged

Discussion on Josephus inserts

Thanks  Am I correct then in assuming that that Josephus
did in fact write about Jesus but Christian copists embellished it

Correct overstates the case  The whole point of the discussions
has been that it is reasonable to assume that there was some brief
reference to Jesus that has been doctored  By consensus this is
the most reasonable of the proposed solutions  but not so much
so as to rule out complete fabrication

   Nice attempt Chris    verrry close
 
   You missed the conspiracy by  step Joseph knew who knocked her up
 He couldn't let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol' Mary prego That
 wouldn't do well for his popularity in the local circles So what 
 happened is that she was feeling guilty he was feeling embarrassed and
 THEY decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise
 been the downfall for both Clever indeed Come to think of it    I
 have gained a new respect for the couple Maybe Joseph and Mary should
 receive all of the praise being paid to jesus

Lucky for them that the baby didn't have any obvious deformities  I could
just see it now Mary gets pregnant out of wedlock so to save face she and
Joseph say that it was God that got her pregnant and then the baby turns
out to be deformed or even worse stillborn  They'd have a lot of
explaining to do

Plus questions for you  why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so 
het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism 

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism it provides more power and ability to
control events

I think you lose the right to talk about THE truth once you say values are
relative   Accuracy is a value judgement too  It so happens I agree with 
the substance of what you say below but it's clear to me that at least 
some values are objective  Truth is better than falsehood peace is
better than war education is better than ignorance  We know these things
if we know anything

And what is better Better is a subjective value judgement

I tell you a lie and as a result you give me all your millions of dollars
of assets and move to India From my perspective falsehood was a 
substantially better than telling the truth How do you think a
log of gurus make a living

I attack your country in war kill everyone and take your rich
natural resources Before I did this I was living in poverty
Looks to me like war was much better than peace

I see no need to go any further Once you address this little issue
of betterness being nonrelativistic we can continue

Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention
I'd say that compromise seems to be better

And I would agree   But it's bloody to pointless to speak of it if it's
merely a matter of taste  Is your liking for peace any better founded
than someone else's liking for icecream  I'm looking for a way to say
yes to that question and relativism isn't it

The problem is Frank that you are bringing your own subjective values
into the debate and on the basis of those values you are making claim
to something that there is not any evidence that I've seen anyhow to
support This is not unsimilar to those people who make claims to
supernatural gods not on the basis of fact but because it makes them feel
better to think that they can minipulate their environment by influencing
those gods It may be comforting but is it real

If you are going to claim that there is an absolute or objective morality
the very first thing you have to do is demonstrate that morality itself
exists as something more than an abstraction Only when you have done that
can we progress to debating whether this morality is absolute or not

There have been many claims that morality is a component of reality but
then again there have been plenty of claims made by different folk over
the centuries Claims without fact to back them up are ultimatly very
hollow things

So having said that I would ask you to begin by demonstrating that morality
is other than just an abstraction Care to meet the challenge

 The authorities I am referring to is the authority of the world
 Islamic community over itself My point was simply that Islamic
 law does apply to muslims wherever they are despite the fact that 
 Islamic law may not be enforcable in nonIslamic countries

Muslims residing in the UK may decide to be 'tried' or whatever by the
Islamic community but their rulings have no legal consequences in these
isles  

It's not really their decision to be tried The rulings do have
legal consequences but only in Islamic law and not in UK law this
should be obvious Enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making
of a judgment Take for example the judgments of the World Court This
is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no
physical or economic effect but which are important despite the fact
that their judgments cannot be enforced

The person may be excommunicated or similar but if it decided to 
mete out violent laws such as the fatwa then it would be breaking UK laws
itself and the persons doing such would be liable to prosecution 


Of course have you read any of this thread before this post 


 To ignore
the country's laws in preference to religious laws which are not indigenous
to the country in question is an absurd and arrogant notion

Of course it is a sort of anarchism Anarchism is explicitly against
Islam Thank you for your well reasoned response but it is beside the
points I've been making in this thread

Atheists are not
mentioned in the Quran because from a Quranic point of view and a
minute's reasoning one can see that there is no such thing

  But there are people who say that they are Atheists If they aren't Atheists
what are they

When the Quran uses the word din it means way of individual thinking behaving
communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs This is often
interpreted as the much weaker term religion 

The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews
Mushriqin Christians etc because the  latter are all din To have a
din you need a set of beliefs assumptions etc to forma a social
code For example the Marxist have those such as History Conflict
etc That they do not put idols sometimes they did to represent
those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other
Mushriq or roughly polytheists 

There cannot be social Atheism because when there is a community
that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate 
the society When they inscribe assumptions say Nation or Progress is 
the natural consequence of Human activity or parlamentarian
democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government however 
they individually insist they do not have gods from the Quranic point
of view they do Therefore by definition atheism does not exist 
We are a atheist society in fact means we reject the din other than
ours 

Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idolsgodsdogmas
suppositions of the society that they part and in that case that
is a personal deviation of belief and Quran tells about such
deviations and disbelief But as I mentioned from a Quranic point of
looking at things there is no Atheism in the macro level 

I think it took more than one minute

  The recent rise of nostalgia in this group combined with the
  incredible level of utter bullshit has prompted me to comb
  through my archives and pull out some of The Best of AltAtheism
  for your reading pleasure  I'll post a couple of these a day
  unless group concensus demands that I stop or I run out of good
  material

  I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving
  attributions  I think the following comes from John A Johnson
  but someone correct me if I'm wrong  This is probably the longest
  of my entire collection




                                  So that the
                                  Prophecy be
                                   Fulfilled

                                       

       In considering the Christian religion and judging it
according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at
fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy  The scribe Matthew is perhaps
the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in
the career of Jesus of Nazareth  As you will see Matthew's main
strategy is to take various Old Testament passages often not even
about the promised Messiah and apply them to the circumstances in
the New Testament  We must also bear in mind the question of the
authenticity of the accounts  Since the gospels were written at
least  years after Jesus was executed we do not know how much
happened exactly as stated  But for purposes of analysis we
will take particular claims at face value

Immanuel

       We begin of course at the beginning

       Mt   Mary will bear a son and you
       Joseph will name him 'Jesus' which means G'd is
       salvation for he will save his people from their
       sins  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had
       spoken by a prophet

       Isaiah   In the days of Ahaz c  BCE
       king of Judah Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made
       war on Jerusalem capitol of Judah but could not
       quite conquer it  When the house of David ie Ahaz
       and his court in Judah were told of this its
       heart and the heart of its people shook   And the
       lord G'd said to Isaiah go to meet with Ahaz 
       And the lord spoke to Ahaz through prophet Isaiah
       naturally saying Ask a sign of G'd your lord  It
       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven  But
       Ahaz said I won't ask I will not put the lord to a
       test  Then Isaiah said Hear then O house of
       David  Is it not enough for you to weary men that
       you must weary my god too  Therefore the lord
       himself will give you a sign  Behold a young woman
       is with child and will bear a son and name him
       Immanuel which means G'd is with us   He will
       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil
       and choose good  For before the child knows how to
       refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings
       you dread will have been deserted

Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics 
Further he the Hebrew word almah young woman as
specifically virgin  But this is not a prophecy about the
Messiah  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen  years
later  It is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother  In
short it not about Jesus  Matthew has made use of a verse out of
context and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary  It
should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general
manner a very general one it can be made to fit Mary  Mary
virgin or not was indeed a young woman with child  Of course
the fit is shady and has problems  Jesus while thought of by
later Christians to be G'd walking among men was never called by
the name Immanuel  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy
for Jesus it becomes at best a cutandpaste prophecy a second
class prophecy   Not too convincing

Egypt

       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem Matthew tells about a
quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to Egypt as if he
wishes to liken Jesus to Moses  This was done to escape an
alleged infanticidal rampage of the king Herod

       Mt   and remained there until the death of
       Herod  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken
       Out of Egypt I have called my son


What the lord really said was this

       Hosea   When Israel was a child I loved him 
       And out of Egypt I called my son  The more I called
       them my people the more they went from me they
       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als and kept burning
       incense to idols

Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle  But it
was indeed Israel that once called out of Egypt wanted to
return  This is history  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of
here  And if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind
up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd   Again this prophecy
is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped

Rachel Weeps

        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt Matthew says that
King Herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions of
all young male children  Matthew then writes

       Mt    By this that which was spoken by the
       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled

       A voice was heard in Ramah wailing and loud
       lamentation Rachel weeping for her children
       she refused to be consoled because they were
       no more   

The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah  referring to the
carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon of Assyria in 
BCE  Rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel Ephraim
and Manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are no
more  It is metaphorical of course since Rachel lived and dies
before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile
       It is interesting to note that it was Leah not Rachel who
was the ancestor of the Judeans the land where Jesus and
Bethlehem were  If anyone should do weeping for her children
it is Leah  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is
that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city
on the way to Ephrath Bethlehem
       As for Herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikely
that such an event actually occurred  One never knows but the
event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible
nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time 
Herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less
evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded  This might be a
prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance
the message of the church's gospel
       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the
infant Moses in Egypt it is highly likely that it is a device set
up by Matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of Jesus
It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention
the rest of the Jeremiah quote   The children the prophet
speaks of are not dead but exiled in the Assyrian Empire  G'd
comforts the weeping Rachel saying that the children will be
returned he will gather them back together  Of course this
would not suit Matthew's purpose as the children he speaks of are
dead for good  Again the prophecy Matthew sets up is not even
that and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not too
convincing

The Nazarene

       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find
another Matthean prophecy  After leaving Egypt Joseph  wife
take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth 

       Mt   that what was spoken of by the prophets
       might be fulfilled He shall be called a Nazarene

First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of
the prophets this time  Second we have to ask who He is 
There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene  Worse
there are no prophecies period mentioning a Nazarene  Still
worse there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at
all  In the book of Judges an angel tells Samson's mother that
she will

       Judges   conceive and bear a son  No razor
       shall tough his head for he will be a Nazirite to his
       god from the day of his birth  He will deliver Israel
       from the hands of the Philistines

This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus or the messiah of G'd 
But it is the best that can be found  Obviously Matthew has
begun to go overboard in cutandpaste prophecies in that he is
simple making them up now

Bearing our
Diseases

       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses
and disabilities

       Mt    This was to fulfil what was spoken by the
       prophet Isaiah He took our infirmities and bore our
       diseases

As expected the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context
and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme  We have

       Is   Surely he the suffering servant has
       borne our sickness and carried our pains

From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah we know that
the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation
of Israel Jehovah's chosen servant and people  He speaks to the
Israelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nations
that look upon it  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish
identity an image of a chastised yet cherished Israel as the
instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd
      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which
are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and
discipline  They do not speak of a servant going around and
healing people  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the
sicknesses and pains of the nations and individual Jews  Jesus
as we all know did not take the diseases onto himself  The
verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come but
rather something that had already happened  While it is believed
that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear
the illnesses he healed  So while someone might want to say
that figuratively Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his
spiritual atonement he has to admit that Matthew's parallel
misses where he intended it to have its effect


Silent Messiah

      Upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that Jesus
ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldn't arouse
the attention of the local rulers

       Mt   This was to fulfill what was spoken by
       the prophet Isaiah   

       Behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved
       with whom my soul is pleased  I will put my spirit on
       him and he will announce justice to the Gentiles  He
       will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear
       his voice in the streets  He will not break a bruised
       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings
       justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his
       name

The Isaiah passage quoted reads

       Is   Behold my servant whom I uphold my
       chosen in whom my soul delights  I have put my
       spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the
       nations  We will not cry or lift up his voice or
       make it heard in the street  He will not break a
       bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick  He will
       faithfully bring forth justice  He will not fail
       burn dimly or be discouraged bruised until he has
       established justice in the earth  And the coastlands
       await his law

You see Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage
because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus  Christians could
never think of Jesus failing never would the light of mankind
burn dimly  But the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to
an end when its job is done  When the gentiles come to embrace
G'd there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will
be the children of G'd  Also the ending phrase has been changed
from the Judaic the coastlands await his law to the
Christologic the Gentiles will hope in his name   While the
original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah the other rewrites it
to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name  If one
has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus one has only
to read the whole chapter Isaiah  and hear about the beloved
but blind and imperfect servant a people robbed and
plundered   So we see that when Matthew's attempt at
prophecy is examined it crumbles

Three Days and
Three Nights

      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very
mouth of the god Jesus himself  He speaks of his crucifixion and
resurrection

       Mt    For as Jonah was in the belly of the
       whale for three days and three nights so will the Son
       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and
       three nights

Before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know
how the Jews understood days  As far as day names went each was
 hours long lasting from sunset pm to the following sunset
pm  What was referred to as a day was the period of light from
am to the ending sunset at pm  Thus according to our time
scale a sabbath day began at pm Friday evening and lasted until
pm saturday evening  This is why the Jews celebrate their
sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays instead of Sundays 
It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that
Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week  Thus
when days and nights are referred to together  hour daylight
portions and  hour night periods are being spoken of  Thus
Jesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise
unresurrected for three days and three nights

      As the good book tells us Jesus was crucified on the ninth
hour which is pm Friday afternoon  He then was put into the
grave sometime after that  Then Jesus left the grave rose
before dawn of what we call Sunday The dawn after the sabbath was
over  What this means is that Jesus was using our time for
clarity in the grave from pm Friday night to some time before
am Sunday morning  We could also add a little time before pm
Friday since the bible is not specific here  What this means
using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day two
nights and possibly a couple of hours of one day  Certainly this
is a problem for Jesus prediction  There is absolutely no way we
are even able to have his death involve three days and three
nights even using modern time measurements   We then are led to
suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little
mistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into his
god's mouth   And no matter who made the prediction it is more
than unconvincing it is counterconvincing

Hearing 
Understanding

     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in
parables stories in which a deeper meaning could be found if
you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the
message of Jesus  He reasons that those who can understand the
parables are the ones he wants  If the people cannot understand
them there is no need to bother with them since they will not
accept the plain message any better  Matthew says

       Mt   With them the audience indeed in
       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says 

       You will indeed hear but never understand and you
       will indeed see but never perceive  Because this
       people's heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of
       hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they
       would not perceive with them her with their ears and
       understand with their heart and turn for me to heal
       them

The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works his
call to the ministry  This is in  BCE when Israel is
flourishing right before it falls under the authority of Assyria 
Isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from G'd
calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah

       Is   And G'd said Go and say to this
       people Hear and hear but do not understand see and
       see but do not perceive'   Make the heart of this
       people fat make their ears heavy and shut their
       eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear
       with their ears and understand with their hearts and
       turn and be healed  Then Isaiah said How long
       lord  And he said Until the cities lie waste
       without inhabitant and houses without men and the
       land is utterly desolate and the G'ds take men far
       away and forsaken places are many in the land  And
       though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned
       again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still
       stands when the tree is felled The holy seed is its
       stump

Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel
to stop listening to the prophet's warnings but reaffirms the
promise made to Solomon's and David's seedlineage  If you read
the rest of Isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the plan
of G'd to use Israel as a servant a light to the nations  Look
at Isaiah   
     We see that Matthew has cutandpasted just a little portion
of Isaiah's verse to suit his own gospel needs  More than that
he has altered the words to make it fit the people who didn't
understand Jesus's stories  And as we see Isaiah's verses are
not prophecies but rather commands from G'd to him in the
present   Once again Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face 

     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they
have the prophetic approval

       Mt   he said nothing to them without a
       parable  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the
       prophet I will open my mouth to them in parables  I
       will utter that which has been hidden since the
       foundation of the world

Matthew really botches up here  He attempts to quote not from a
prophet but from the Psalms

       Ps   I will open my mouth in parable  I will
       utter dark sayings of old things that we all have
       heard and known things that our fathers have told us 
       We will not hide them from their children but tell to
       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the
       lord

As was pointed out the verses in the Psalms do not really come
from a prophet  You might also want to know that earlier copies
of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet 
Apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some
of it up
     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that once
again Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures  As Jesus
has said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will not
understand them  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden 
Further they speak of things known that our fathers have told
us  Jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the
world  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion 
This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms  No
wonder Matthew had to rewrite them   And still once again
Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face  But
Christians rarely look at this  Matthew's prophecies aren't the
only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad


Excuses of
Little Faith

       In Mt  we see that the disciples are able to go
around casting out demons except in one case  Not knowing what
epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were
possesed with demons  It is no wonder that the disciples were
unable to dispossess the epileptic  But Jesus perhaps no more
enlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them saying
they didn't have enough faith   This seems strange  Why was this
demon special  It seems that either a true believer has faith or
he does not  Apparently enough faith will allow someone to move
mountains  Of course you will find no one these days that can
move real mountains  No one parts seas  The only miracles the
Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to
Mexico or some faraway place  Major miracles are making some old
woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning TV

       And the gods including Jesus are always shrouded in
ancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in their
sacred pasts  They are either dead sleeping or hiding in
heaven with people rumouring about their imminent return and
their great miracles of days long gone  Yet life goes on  

     Tales of mystics stories of miracles all in a distant time
or a distant place  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the
old days Jehovah too  But now they are silent  All the
theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see
God anymore

       We're too lazy we're not zealous enough we're
       sinful it's just his plan we put too many of our
       own demands on G'd's appearance if we had the right
       faith if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms

     Yet even the most pious of men have not seen G'd  You dear
reader have not seen G'd  Not literally you know that to be
true I know that's presumptuous and bold  But searching your
heart you know what I mean  All that we've seen religions do is
make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd  They say
our little faith does not merit us to see G'd  Sometimes they
say See the love in these people you worship with see the
lives of people change that is seeing G'd   Thus people get
lulled to sleep satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday
sights   But that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of it is
not seeing G'd the way people used to see  
      What we see in the world that is good is the compassion of
human hearts the love given and taken by men and women the
forgiveness practised by Christian  Atheist alike beauty created
by the mind of man  These are the things that are done these are
what we see  But it is said this is so only because everybody
has little faith

Jesus Rides on
an Ass

       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah
king Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into
Jerusalem  

       Mt   This took place to fulfil what was spoken
       by the prophet saying

       Tell the daughter of Zion Behold your king is
       coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a
       asscolt

Of course the passage quoted from Zechariah  reads a little
differently

       Lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and
       victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass
       colt he will command peace to the nations

There isn't all that much difference here except that Zechariah
only involves one animal  an asscolt  while Matthew reads the
poetic wording slightly differently  Thus he has Jesus call for
both a colt and an adult ass  From Matthew's version we get a
comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two
donkeys  This could inevitably lead to a theological
proctological dilemma   We find that in the account written
earlier by St Mark only the colt was called for and brought to
Jesus  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly and
shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he has
bungled  Now excluding many respectable Christians I have met I
have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses
the situation is often reversed nowadays

       Then entering the Jerusalem temple the priests were
angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah  But
Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done

       Mt   Haven't you read  Out of the mouth of
       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise'

It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus
was never one to point out such little prophetic things AND
since as we might expect the quote is in error which seems to
fit Matthew's track record quite well  We might ask Jesus or
Matthew Haven't you read for the source reads

       Psalms   O YaHWeH our lord how majestic is
       your name in the whole world   You whose glory is
       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you
       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the
       enemy and the avenger

The passages hardly need comment  There is no perfect praise
spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to G'd
not his messiah king and not Jesus  As mentioned it seems to be
just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic
scripture

YHVH said to 
my lord

      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish
messiahking is to be descended  The Jews agree it is king
David  But then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 

       The LORD said to my Lord sit at my right hand until
       I put your enemies under your feet

Taken at face value Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic
descent  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer  Of
course the Christian answer is that he agrees but is trying to
make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine
nature of the messiahking  It's tempting to believe this if one
is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation 
But there are problems
       In Jesus's time the psalm was thought to be about the
messiah  And it is easy to see why David might refer to the
messiah as his superior  We need only look at the scriptures
about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king
bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's
rule  Of course the Jews listening had no good answer and the
passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the
Christians worship  The problem lies in the meaning of this
psalm an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had
also made  One must remember that there were various factions
among the Jews often as a result of different expectations of the
messiahking  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists like
his audience who thought the messiah's advent was imminent and
who interpreted Psalms  among others as being messianic
What is the problem then  Psalm  literally reads

       YHVH's utterance to my lord
	Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your
       footstool

       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion  Rule
       in the midst of your foes  Your people will offer
       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the
       holy mountains  

       You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek
       forever

The word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian
bibles to denote divinity in this lord  But in the Hebrew the
word is adoni and no capitalisation exists  Adoni simply means
lord a generic term as we would use it  It is used often in
the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd  It is merely an
address of respect  
      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word
refers either to divinity or to the messiahking  That this is
supposed to be written by David is not certain  The title of the
psalm translates to either a psalm of David or a psalm about
David  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court
poet about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd  If the
psalm had been written by David it is unlikely that he would be
talking about the messiah  The idea of a perfect king descended
from David was not present in David's age  We have extensive
tales of David's doings and sayings none of which include any
praises of a messiah
     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after
David was dead in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of
favour for David's kingdom on hold  
     The description in the psalm fit David very well  David was
promised by G'd a rise to power victory over his enemies
successful judgement among the nations he conquered  He achieved
the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king
enabled to bless the people   It all fits
      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone
though  Here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to though
his use of the scripture is rather questionable  Still this
event is common to the other gospels too  So we let Matthew off
a little more easily this time  It is interesting to note
though how Matthew dresses up the event  The earlier gospel of
Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd 
Matthew has the Pharisees who became the religious competition of
an infant Christianity be the target of Jesus's question  As we
might expect Matthew writes that the event ends up by
embarrassing the Pharisees  Such power is the pen

Moses  Jesus
Had it Together
All Along

       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a
pseudoprophecy in John's gospel  The gospel story of John
deserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removed
from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew 
But for the moment we will just look at one verse  The early
church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah
king and on an artificial extension of the original promises made
by G'd  When constructing the history of Abraham Moses wrote of
a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people  While this
was accomplished eventually under the rule of king David the
Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the
fulfillment of the promise  But to do so they expanded on the
promise preaching about a heavenly kingdom

       John  JC speaking Your father Abraham
       rejoiced to see My day  He say it and was glad

It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham but
Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah or anything Christian 
I have tried and failed to find any event in the Old Testament
which corresponds to John's little prophecy  It is par for the
course to see St John making up Old Testament backings just like
his forerunner Matthew  Many Christians know that their faith has
many of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising they
still cling to it

The Potter's
Field

      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by
one of his followers Judas Iscariot   Matthew writes

       Mt   And throwing down the pieces of silver
       in the temple Judas departed But the chief
       priests taking the silver said It isn't lawful for
       us to put it in the treasury since it is blood
       money  So they bought a potter's field with it to
       bury strangers in Then was fulfilled what was
       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah

       And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price
       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the
       sons of Israel and they gave them for the potter's
       field as the lord directed me

This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament
Scripture  First Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name
of the prophet  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which
Matthew makes use of

       Zech   And they weighed out my wages
       thirty shekels of silver  Then YHVH said to me Cast
       them to the treasury the lordly price at which I
       was paid off by them  So I took the thirty shekels of
       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of
       YHVH

First of all the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer
of the messiah or of G'd  The deal with a shepherd most likely
a priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people
shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with
one another  The word treasury had been replaced by the King
James Scholars with to the potter precisely because this made
Matthew's quote fit better  But this is a blatant error  The
correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed treasury which also
makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context whereas potter's
field is totally unrelated  Whether the mistranslation was
intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation  However given
Matthew's track record one finds it hard to resist the notion of
intentional dishonesty
      Of course Matthew would have ample reason for altering the
text  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation and if
as most Christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregard
the contextual incongruity Matthew might have another prophecy to
toss around  However the correct translation of Zechariah
directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high
priests  The high priests would not put the money in the
treasury  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the
opposite  Of course to the average ThursdayNight Bible student
the prophecy as presented by Matthew would be taken at New
Testament face value  To those Matthew's work is convincing
enough

Wine Vinegar
 Casting Lots

      Then Jesus is led away to be crucified

       Mt   they gave him vinegar to drink
       mingled with gall but when he tasted it he would not
       drink it  And when they had crucified him they
       divided his garments among them by casting lots that
       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet

       They parted my garments among them and upon my
       vesture did they cast lots

First of all the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour
wine of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly  We find
that right before Jesus dies the soldiers themselves give him
some to drink not polluted with gall

       Jn   Jesus said I thirst  A bowl of
       vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the
       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth  When he
       had received the vinegar he said It is finished

But Matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from the
prophets but one from the Psalms

       Ps   I looked for pity but there was none
       and for comforters but I found none  They gave me
       poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and
       for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink  Add
       to them punishment upon punishment may they have no
       acquittal from thee  Let them be blotted out of the
       Book of the Living

Of course the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request
of drink  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity  The psalm
quoted is about David and his political and military enemies  It
is not about the messiah or Jesus  It is then not surprising that
we run into further problem when we see that the Jesus in the
psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas the
Jesus of the gospels says

       Lk   Jesus said Father forgive them the
       don't know what they do

Further Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by
having gall a bitter substance put into Jesus's drink not his
meat as the psalm stipulates

       With the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally
ask What of the casting of lots  This brings up the nd
Psalm which deserves discussion all by itself  Suffice it now to
say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no
great thing  It turns out that this happened often to any felon
in those days  As we will soon see it is perhaps the least
erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus  It does
indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of
Jesus's clothes  For a man so removed from worldly possessions
his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some
suspicions

The nd Psalm

      This psalm is attributed to David as a lament of his
condition under the attack of his enemies  It becomes a song of
praise to YHVH and of hope  Taken out of context parts of it
seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well  We
will examine the primary passages

       Verse   My god my god why have you forsaken me 
       Why are you so far from helping me far from the words
       of my groaning  Oh my god I cry by day but you
       don't answer and by night but find no rest

Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross 
This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus rather
than king David  Of course the rest of the first stanza does not
fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution  Jesus is not pictured as
complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the
lamb led mute before its shearers  Indeed Jesus doesn't do much
groaning even when on the cross  He certainly does not cry by
both day and night on the cross

         But I am a worm and no man scorned by men 
       All who see me mock at me  They make faces and wag
       their heads  He committed his cause to YHVH  So let
       him deliver him for he delights in him

This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well with the
exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm

         Many bulls encompass me they open their
       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion

         Yea dogs are round about me a company of
       evildoers encircle me they have pierced my hands and
       feet  I can see all my bones They divide my
       garments among them and cast lost for my raiment

         But you YHVH be not far away  Deliver my
       soul from the sword my life from the power of the
       dog  Save me from the mouth of the lion and my
       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull

It would seem quite convincing and I'm sure the early Christian
fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too  Unfortunately
this prophecy has a fatal flaw  The words have pierced really
do not exist in the psalm  The correct Hebrew translation is

         Yea dogs are round about me a company of
       evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my
       hands and feet

In Hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form
which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character  The
word in the Hebrew text is literally like the lion ka'ari
which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal
imagery employed by the psalm writer  It is convenience that
would urge a Christian to change the word to ka'aru   But to
add the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is
just what the Christian translators have chosen to do  While the
correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to
Jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the
translators

       Apart from the erroneous verse  the psalm does not lend
itself to Jesus so easily  Verse  speaks of the sufferer being
saved from a sword rather than a cross  This naturally fits the
psalm's true subject king David  As a side note we now know
that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather
the forearms  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional
thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on
his palms  But then facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs

      Matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not
attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord
Jesus  But the psalm like many others was on the minds of all
the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and
interpretations of Jesus's life and death  How much these
scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down
is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian
theology  It is easy to see for those who are not faithful
fundamentalists how some of the events in the New Testament might
have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager Matthew  But
it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural
matters and prophetic claims  So far this has not said good
things for St Matthew

The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's
crucifixion  John's gospel recount written about  years after
the fact tells us at Jesus's execution

       Jn   But one of the soldiers pierced his
       side with a spear and out came blood and water
       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled
       The will look on him whom they've pierced

Of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of
context   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of
Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with
them

       Zc   And YHVH will give victory to Judah
       And on that day I will seek to destroy the nations
       that come against Jerusalem in Judah  And I will
       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on
       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have
       pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him
       like you weep over a firstborn child

John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that
Matthew's attempts  Matthew at least usually excontexts more
than just one passage  John's errors are grossly obvious and
blatant here  It does not speak well for any of the gospel
writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their
religion were founded


Reckoned with
Transgressors

       After his arrest Jesus is quickly executed for claiming
the Jewish kingship messiahship   According to one version of
the gospel tale Jesus gets executed along with two thieves

       Mk   And with him they crucified two robbers
       one on his right one on his left  And so the
       scripture was fulfilled which says

       He was reckoned with the transgressors

Here Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 
about the servant nation of Israel  The passage is not about the
messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah  and its
surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation  The
verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the
past not a prediction of what is to come in any event  The
servant is thought of as a criminal  This also happens to fit the
description of Jesus  Had the passage really been about the
messiah it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between
two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in Isaiah  Jesus would
more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry  He was
considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his
career   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to
steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that Mark could
have had made a better analogy with general comparisons

       Mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with
Jesus also reviled him   This is to be expected from a
couple of robbers  Of course in his later recount St Luke
decides to change some things  Luke tells us

       Lk   And one of the criminals who was hanged
       with him railed Aren't you the messiah Save
       yourself and us

This certainly fits with Mark's recount which tells how the
people who crucified Jesus said Save yourself and that the
robbers did the same  But then Luke goes on

       But the other criminal rebuked the first saying
       Don't you fear G'd since you are under the same
       sentence of condemnation  And we indeed justly so
       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds 
       But this man has done nothing wrong And he said
       Jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom 
       And Jesus answered Verily I say to you today you
       will be with me in paradise

Now this little dialogue seems highly contrived  It stretches
the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking
his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech  We have a rather
strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his
punishment and the justness of his suffering   Such a man
apparently noble and of principle doesn't seem likely to have
been a robber  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by
Luke  Of course Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's  
Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus not both  It is easy
enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made
up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free
words of G'd do not have this avenue open  This is yet another
example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and
expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology  In this case
the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have
seen

The End of the
World
       Mt 

       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and
embarrassing passages in the New Testament  It is found in all
three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most
unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity  Jesus
mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings and
his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world
which he has been warning about

       The disciples Tell us when will this the temple's
       destruction be and what will be the sign of your
       coming and of the close of the age

       Jesus Take care that no one leads you astray for
       many will come in my name saying I am the christ  
       you will hear of wars and rumours of wars for
       this must take place but the end is not yet   For
       nation will rise against nation all this is but the
       beginning of the birthpangs
             They will deliver you up put you to death
       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray
       But he who endures to the end will be saved  This
       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a
       testimony to the nations and then the end will come
             So when you see the desolation spoken of by the
       prophet Daniel let those who are in Judea flee to
       the mountains

             Immediately after the tribulation of those days
       the sun will be darkened the stars will fall from
       heaven then will appear the sign of the Son of Man
       in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
       and see the Son of Man coming and he will send out
       his angels and gather his elect
             Learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its
       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know
       that summer is near  So also when you see all these
       things you will know that He is near at the very
       gate  Truly I say to you this generation will not
       pass away until all these things take place
             But of the day and hour no one knows not the
       angels not the Son but only the Father Therefore
       you also must be ready for the Son of Man is coming
       at an hour you do not expect

From this it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in
within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples  He tells
them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour that it
will come and thus they must be ready  Theologians have wet
their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error 
But unfortunately Jesus made himself to explicit  He told his
disciples that their generation would still be around at the End
and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be
swept away
      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant
nature of the Bible and said that the phrase this generation
shall not pass away really means this race of people will not
pass away  Of course the word for generation is used many
times to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples 
It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek
he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear  But it is
quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples at
least some of them are supposed to live to the End of the World 
The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking
at the Apostles' responses  It becomes abundantly clear from
Rev   Peter   John  and Rev  that Jesus
meant exactly what he said  The End was very near

       For  years Christians have rationalised this th
chapter of Matthew or ignored its meaning altogether  For 
years they have waited for their executed leader to come back
hearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that He is coming soon 
Surely He must be  All we must do is wait  Can you imagine how
tired He must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for
just the right moment to spring


       So shortly after his crucifixion Jesus of Nazareth
JoshuabenJoseph died   It is said that after three days or
three days and three nights or three periods of time or three
eternal seconds or three of whatever they can decide makes for
less trouble he was seen again resurrected glowing with divine
radiance  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best
interests of his new religion to stick around and therefore
disappeared from sight into heaven  So the story goes anyway 
As has been seen there were many things attributed to Jesus when
people got around to writing the gospel stories down  To them
Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture  We have
seen though that this matter is quite shaky  But throughout
Church history Christians have held fast to faith in simple
belief  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with
argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away
from question  To question and investigate has never been the
easiest way to treat matters  Thus for  years the
prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely
accepted  Things may well continue that way for some time 
Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity
have been accepted and used properly or improperly to support
wars and persecution I suppose there is one prophecy of which
Christianity can securely keep hold

       Mt   Jesus Don't think that I have come to
       bring peace on earth  I haven't come to bring peace
       but rather a sword

Too bad you're starting off with a faulty translation Try this instead

	First I want to start right out and say that I'm a Christian  It 
makes sense to be one  Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book liar 
lunatic or the real thing  I might be a little off on the title but he 
writes the book  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity 
in the process he became a Christian himself

I assume you are posting to encourage comments  how much history has
Tony Campello read  Not much it seems 

	The arguements he uses I am summing up  The book is about whether 
Jesus was God or not  I know many of you don't believe but listen to a 
different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what 
others have to say  

It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about
If only those christian scientists would take note

In Australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian 
scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly
true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified
by using the laws of physics  For example there are a few chaps who are 
trying to prove that the age of the universe is  years old and that the
error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed 
light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been 
accounted for  

	The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a 
modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he was

Or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never 
intended to become a manifesto for a billion people  Did Tony follow that one
up

	Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows  Who would 
die for a lie  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar  People 
gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing 
someone who was or had been healed  

Millions of people have died for a lie  This  point is difficult to 
substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments
work in that way but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed 
themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory
of the Spanish invaders  The list is endless  The Aztecs lost BTW

Call me a fool but I believe he did heal people
  
That is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone
to become a christian  More to the point it does not add weight to
the claim that Jesus was the real thing


	Niether was he a lunatic  Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
to someone who was crazy  Very doubtful in fact rediculous  For example 
anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see 
this right away

Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany  More to the
point did Tony mention this  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his
many colleagues  fools or  illogical men their support of Hitler was based 
I presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with 
his principles  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler
was sane

 

	Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the 
real thing  

Hmmm I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a Therefore

	Some other things to note  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in 
the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in  hrs alone  This in his betrayal 
and Crucifixion  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I 
write I will use it

This is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions I have had with
people result in  quoting the bible  The only reasonable way I think
people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of
metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to
present  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or
she will end up in all sorts of shit   

Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe
the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone 
who thinks the bible is total fiction that Jesus is real by quoting the
book is totally pointless  For example in mathematics you cannot say a is
equal to b because a is equal to b

  

	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is  

That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed 
in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all
claiming to be correct  

It 
is certainly not what I see a lot in churches  Rather I think it 
should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's 
sake  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the 
same  Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives 
over to him  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it to be a 
real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at  But 
just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes 
time  We don't rush it in one day Christianity is your whole life  
It is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in 
a while  We box everything into time units  Such as work at this 
time sports Tv social life  God is above these boxes and should be 
carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for 
ourselves  	  

I think if you posted this part to altreligion you would get more flames
than here   I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments
of a stranger should be of interest to other people 

Someone famous said that there two evils in life polititians and churchs one
rules by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead  If I am pressed I
could probably find the exact quotation

I strongly suggest that you look up a book called THE BIBLE THE QURAN AND
SCIENCE by Maurice Baucaille a French surgeon  It is not comprehensive
but it is well researched  I imagine your library has it or can get it
for you through interlibrary loan


  I shall try to get hold of it when I have time to read of course 

In short Dr Baucaille began investigating the Bible because of pre
ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies  He assumed that
some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by
gone days  So he read what he could find in Hebrew Greek Aramaic
What he found was that the problems didn't go away they got worse
Then he decided to see if other religions had the same problems
So he picked up the Holy Qur'an in French and found similar prob
lems but not as many  SO he applied the same logoic as he had
with the Bible he learned to read it in Arabic  The problems he
had found with the French version went away in Arabic  He was unable
to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an but
what he did find made sense with modern understanding  So he
investigated the Traditions the hadith to see what they had to
say about science  they were filled with science problems after
all they were contemporary narratives from a time which had by
pour standards a primitive world view  His conclusion was that
while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to
say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the
Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in
the Traditions  How would a man of th Century Arabia have known
what not to include in the Holy Qur'an assuming he had authored
it  


    So in short the writer or writers of Quran decided to stay away from
science  if you do not open your mouth then you don't put you foot into
your mouth either 

   But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science then one can
not make claims like Bobby does that you have great science in Quran

   Basically I want to say that none of the religious texts are supposed to
be scientific treatises So I am just requesting the theists to stop making
such wild claims

investigated the Traditions the hadith to see what they had to
say about science  they were filled with science problems after
all they were contemporary narratives from a time which had by
pour standards a primitive world view  His conclusion was that
while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to
say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the
Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in
the Traditions  How would a man of th Century Arabia have known
what not to include in the Holy Qur'an assuming he had authored
it  

This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue


The book is in two sections  Section  contains a fairly reasonable
analysis of the Bible showing many inconsistencies between the Bible
and modern science  Well we all know that no surprises

Section  analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories
and seems on the face of it to present a good case showing the Koran
is consistent with modern science  However it was plain to me that
this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the
Koran  Take the flood for example the bible is full of detail
forty days and forty nights pair of every animal etc we all
know this is nonsense  The Koran's description of the same event is
so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as A big river 
flooded for a few days and caused much damage  Yes no contradiction
but also not much fact

The Koran might be consistent with modern science but being
consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that
time does not seem much of an achievement

The book concludes by saying something like the Koran must have had
divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot
of to us now ridiculous ideas about the universe and none of them
can be found in the Koran  Arguing for the greatness of a book by
talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme

The above is of course from memory so I may have missed some points

 Exodus 

         And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with
           child so that she has a miscarriage yet there is no further
           injury he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may
           demand of him and he shall pay as the judges decide
         But if there is any further injury then you shall appoint
           as a penalty life for life
         eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
         burn for burn wound for wound bruise for bruise

 The most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if
 men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry the penalty
 is only a fine  If however the woman is injured or dies the
 lex talionis doctrine of an eye for an eye applies  This is the
 Jewish interpretation and is supported by Jewish commentaries on
 these verses
    This is quite an embarrassment for prolifer Christians so there is
 of course an alternate explanation  The alternative interprets the
 word miscarriage to mean premature birthie the child is born
 aliveand further injury to mean injury to either the woman or
 the fetus  This is not a straightforward interpretation it is not
 so far as I know supported by any Jewish commentaries and it does
 not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible

What if any historical reference do we have to abortion at this time  Did
the ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion I am
truly asking not making a point veiled as a question  If there is 
little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion it is
not surprising the Bible makes little reference to it as it makes little
reference to nuclear power and contamination

While your interpretation is a reasonable one I see no reason to reject
the other out of hand  The King Jimmy translation says if there is no
further mischief  This does not necessarily imply to the woman  I know
if my wife we expecting and someone cause her to spontaneously abort we
would feel that a life was truly taken not simply a process halted

Wow you're quicker to point out heresy than the Church in the
Middle ages Seriously though even the Sheiks at AlAzhar don't
claim that the Shi'ites are heretics Most of the accusations
and fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from the
Wahabis For that matter you should read the original works of
the Sunni Imams Imams of the four madhabs The teacher of
at least two of them was Imam Jafar Sadiq the sixth Imam of the
Shi'ites 

Although there is plenty of false propaganda floating around
about the Shi'ites esp since the revolution there are also
many good works by Shi'ites which present the views and teachings
of their school Why make assumptions and allegations like
people in this group have done about Islam in general about Shi'ites

I lived in Tokyo for a year and a half and one of the many reasons why

Sorry it is generally accepted that the rise of the inquisition is
the reason why torture was introduced outside the Romanic countries
at the end of the Middle Ages In other words the Holy Mother Church
which is lead infallibly by the Holy Ghost has spread it

The Roman Catholic Church claims to be lead by the infallable pope
That's why she the RC Church has done so many wicked things to Xtians and
nonbelievers alike
 
 
The rationale that the pope speaking ex cathedra is infallible is based
on the claim above The dogma about the pope is of Jesuitic origin and
has not been been accepted before the mid of the last century

Kevin makes a good point here and when that theists miss alltoooften  That
is the belief in a diety is not necessarily coupled with agreementlove of
that diety so really they have yet another bit of convincing to do just beyond
belief
I guess the standard argumet goes something like well once you believe in
God you know God is love and you will choose to love him if it wasnt so
widely accepted and asserted it'd be laughable

 I love god just as much as she loves me If she wants to seduce me

 But if HeShe did you would probably consider it rape  

Probably because it IS rape

 
  Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you will see
  that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic
  Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  Yet some think it is
  the ultimate  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
  know more than you do now 
 
 Your argument is of the type you'll know once you try
 Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried and believed
 for many years but were eventually honest enough to admit that 
 they had lived in a virtual reality
 
 
 Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe So  

So nothing  It may work for some but not for others it doesn't give any
insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion it would seem to be
dependent solely on the individual as well as individuallycreated  And since
Christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better
than ours I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary or even
particularly attractive

 
  To learn you must accept that which you don't know
 
 What does this mean To learn you must accept that you don't know 
 something righto But to learn you must accept something I don't
 know why This is not the way I prefer to learn It is unwise to
 merely swallow everything you read Suppose I write a book telling
 how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn tm has helped me in my
 daily problems would you accept this since you can't know whether
 it is true or not
 
 
 No one asks you to swallow everything in fact Jesus warns against it   But let
 me ask you a question  Do you beleive what you learn in history class or for
 that matter anything in school  I mean it's just what other people have told
 you and you don't want to swallow what others say right  

Well we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not but at the
very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that say there
was a military conflict in Vietnam  years ago then there is a supernatural
diety who wants us to live a certain way  The fact that Jesus warned against
it means nothing  I warn against it too  Big deal

 
 The life  death and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact  

This is not true  The first two choices here life and death are scantily
documented and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible and
that is totally circular  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination or
one's ignorance  Someone else will address this I'm sure and refer you to
plenty of documentation

As much
 as anything else you learn  How do you choose what to believe and what not to
 I could argue that George Washington is a myth  He never lived because I don't
 have any proof except what I am told   However all the major events of the life
 of Jesus Christ were fortold hundreds of years before him  Neat trick uh

How is this  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to
manipulateinterpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the
coming of Christ  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is
autmoatically interpreted as the Cross  What a miscarriage of philology

 
 There is no way to get into a sceptical heart  You can not say you have given a 
 sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have  You must TRUST not just go 
 to church and participate in it's activities  Were you ever willing to die for what
 you believed  

Well since we have skeptical hearts thank goodness there is no way to get
into us  Here we have the irreconcilable difference Christians glorify
exactly what we tend to despise or snub trustbelieffaith without knowledge 
If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my
enkephalins go up then I may associate this as a sign of God it will feel
right and I will trust without knowing  Maybe  Religosity does not seem to
be anything that is conclusively arrived at but rather it seems to be more of
a sudden affliction
I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed many of us were
not  The question is is suchg an attitude reflective of a correct or
healthy morality  IT would seem not to be  The same thing could reflect
fanaticism for example and is any case an expression of simple selfishness

I found this little gem I don't know if anyone has any interestcomments




Hi everyone
           I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem  I know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying' You fools
do you still think that just believing is enough'

Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by God according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith
But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to
him ie doesn't know him  condemned so a lukewarm Christian someone who
knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible

Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do
as taught in Romans but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spatout'

Can anyone help me this really bothers me 

in Christ

Will

 What is the figure for the general population  The last I heard  of
 Americans believe in reincarnation  Can somebody quote a stat

I don't have a stat but unfortunately I did read generally that both smoking
and belief in the supernatural occultish garbage is on the rise here


 
  I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which
  ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus
  
  So in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to
  atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in
  their beliefs over four years  There is nowhere to run 
  
 Funny  In my country it works the other way round  Univ life is v v
 stressful for most people remember we're an Asian population  Xtians
 like to prey on these people  There is nowhere to run from them  
 

This is very interesting  I thing the principle is sort of the same though
all philosophical ideas are generally tried out and tested mostly during
college years  Whether the idea is christian or atheist doesn't always matter
But I'd like to say it's because atheists are more intelligent

I would recomend to anyone out there to visit your local Christian bookstore
and become aware of the stuff they sell	Quite
interesting  Most of the stuff is far from intelectual  About the level of
Chick pamphelets  If it is a common fundie bookstore it should have at
least one section about how you should hate Wiccans Pagans Catholics
Mormons rock musicians and anyone else who is not as fanatical as them 
Hate for the Love of Godtm It is even more interesting watching the
people who frequent such places  Very scary people  They hear voices from
God telling them whatever they want to hear  If they were not Christians
most of them would be locked away  Maybe this is why Federal money was
reduced to Mental institutions by the reagan administration	Had to get
their religious leaders out

Where would Christianity be if Jesus got eight to fifteen years with time
off for good behavior

 One wonders just what people who ask such questions understand by the term
 objective if anything
 
I consider it to be a useful fiction an abstract ideal we can strive
towards  Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string it doesn't
actually exist but we can talk about things as if they were like it and
not be too far wrong
 
 How could striving toward an ideal be in any way useful if the ideal 
 had no objective existence

Wow  An actual point

A perfectly efficient power station would convert all of the energy in coal
into electricity  There is absolutely no way we can build a perfect power
station it's an ideal  But striving towards that ideal is undeniably useful
and valuable is it not

OK let me narrow the question Is it useful to strive toward a

 The bedrock of spiritual unreason is the belief that resonant yet

but theology is full of reason even if it is as we believe based on false
premises etc etc

 illdefined terms eg spirit transcendental mind self
 consciousness ultimate reality soul elan vital etc have
 meaning Sadly adherents of spiritual movements are seldom satisfied

hold on there no meaning to consciousness or mind or self

 with this harmless illogicality they seem inexorably drawn to a belief

what illogicality

 in the primacy of the spiritual and transcendental over the material
 and empirical ie the primacy of pipe dreams jabberwocky and
 illusion over facts science and reason

since when is for instance nonbehaviourist psychology a pipe dream 
Surely the major purpose of the science of psychology is to understand the
workings of the mind

 All creatures all feelings all thoughts all perceptions all
 processes and all phenomena are manifestations of the mundane ie
 matter energy space and time Those who believe otherwise albeit
 some do not supplicate God are not atheists

manifestations of the mundane sounds rather transcendental to me In fact
matter energy space and time are well measured but mysterious
concepts 

Does an atheist really have to believe in your reductionism or be cast out as
not following the true faith

said re Dan Schaertel's article if I followed the quoting right


 As much as anything else you learn  How do you choose what
 to believe and what not to  I could argue that George
 Washington is a myth  He never lived because I don't have
 any proof except what I am told  However all the major
 events of the life of Jesus Christ were fortold hundreds of
 years before him  Neat trick uh

 How is this  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to
 manipulateinterpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the
 coming of Christ  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is
 autmoatically interpreted as the Cross  What a miscarriage of philology

I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we
take the appellation Rabbi' seriously then Jesus had a full
grasp of contemporary scripture'

Mat Jesus saith unto them Did ye never read in the scriptures

Mat Jesus answered and said unto them Ye do err not knowing
Mat the scriptures nor the power of God

Following from this he would have been in a wonderful
position to fulfil prophesies and the NT says as much

Mat But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled
Mat that thus it must be

Mat But all this was done that the scriptures of the
Mat prophets might be fulfilled Then all the disciples
Mat forsook him and fled

If the books comprising the referredto scripture' had not
been accessible then it probably would be a different
matter

 What is the difference between a chemist and someone who is taught
 Chemistry at say Cambridge University

Put like this I can't answer I was originally pointing out that your
attitude seemed to be I don't know if it really was that chemists
tend to ignore all kinds of effects your original posting stated that
when doing chemistry it is common to ignore atomic interactions and
I responded that this is exactly what chemists do

 Has there been some revolution in teaching methods in the last four years

Perhaps this revolution has yet to reach Cambridge my now I'll get
flamed for sure  But perhaps I am guilty of referring to 
true chemists tm which are nothing but my ideal and do not
actually exist Chemistry is a very easy subject to treat poorly

 Perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that I was thinking of organic
 chemistry whereas you were thinking of physical chemistry

No actually organic chemists were among the first chemists to use
modern MO theories for explaining reactions that did not fit into the
old models In synthetic organic chemistry which still comprises
a large part of organic chemistry it is indeed common to ignore
the rest of the molecule and pay attention only to the functional
groups but I think this too has changed with the advent of
molecular modelling and asymmetric synthesis Supramolecular 
interactions can be taken into account albeit with difficulty

 By the way newsannouncenewusers has an article can't remember which
 one that recommends reading a newsgroup for  month before posting  
 This makes sense because you get an idea who the players are and what 
 the current discussions are about

 Am I the only one who followed that advice

No I spent a month just reading too mainly because I did not know
much about the way atheists think I even printed out the FAQs and
discussed it with a friend before I started posting

Altatheism deals with religious issues more appropriately lack of
religious beliefs which are by their very nature very controversial
It makes sense to read what is being discussed and how just to make
sure you are not repeating something others have said better

	I am contending that in this case and in the case of the sale
of pesticides by UK companies that they knew full well that it was to 
be used for the production of chemical weapons even if that was not its
officially stated purpose

 I personally don't think that letting Iran conquer Iraq would have been a 
 good thing  

	For that matter neither do I for the reasons you state It is the 
hypocrisy and claims the US did not help Iraq that make me angry plus the
fact that the USA seems to believe it has the right to interfere where
is sees fit ie has an interest rather than a duty to intervene where
it is required This is demonstrated by the failure of the US to do anything
about East Timor and the region is becoming destabilised The USA might
have done something approaching the right thing given my reservations about
the uncessary number of civillian casualites but for wholly the wrong reasons
and after having a hand in creating the situation

 That in no way would affect the US later military action against Iraq

	I did not suggest it would and it would be ridiculous to assert
otherwise I was simply indicating the USA has previously aided Iraq

 Intel on manufacturing techniques or something of that nature 

	No apparently data orginally from satellites although I doubt
that Iraq would have been given the raw data concerning troop concentrations

Saudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering
in the politcs of newly renunified Yemen including assasinations and 
border incursions It is entirely possible that they will soon invade
Unluckily for Yemen it is not popular in the West as they managed to put

 Andrew
 
 The myth to which I refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have
 created to make religion appear absurd 

Counterfeit atheists Hmmmm So we're just cheap knockoffs of the
True Atheists 

Religion demonstrates itself to be absurd Constantly Personally if 
someone asks I'm happy to point out how this is so 

 Rather than approach religion
 including Christainity in a rational manner and debating its claims
 as the are stated atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then
 hold the religious accountable for beliefs they don't have What is
 more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist

Man what is your pill wrt atheists If you're going to make such
contentious statements back them up At least READ NEWS timeandtime
again we've hashed out the beliefs various religous doctrines hold 
Try debating reasonably with someone who makes a statement like 
more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist
Then take a look at the responses we've given Tammy Seem pretty
reasonable nay even polite to me 

accusations of myths aflyin'
  
 Here's a good example of of what I said above Read the post again I
 said Acoording to  which means I am referring to Christian
 doctrine as I understand it if I am speaking for myself you'll know
 it My purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of Christain
 doctrines since it seemed germane

I saw your reference to According to in the original article
Then you do such an excellent job of spewing dogma that well the
implication was pretty clear if wrong in this case

jeez a misunderstanding Let it go

more statements to wrap this thing up
 
  If you read my post with same care as read the FAQ we wouldn't be
 having this conversation

If you had WRITTEN your post with the same as care as the FAQ has been
we wouldn't be having this discussion

gems about evidence deleted

 
 Yes human reason does always come back to the existence of God we're
 having this discussion are we not

Jeez do I have to point this out to you This discussion is not all
instances of human reason Therefore your implication is false


 
 Well this is interesting Truth is to be determined by it politically
 correct content Granted it's extremely unhip to be a WASP male and
 anything European is contemptable but I thought this kind of
 dialogue the purpose of aa was to get at the truth of things But
 then I remember the oxymoron reasonalble atheist and I understand

How lame can you get Who said anything about the 'truth' of things
Read the FAQ very carefully please Then report your findings about
where it says the purpose of aa is to find the 'truth' of things

And stop impressing your own misguided image of atheists upon us It's
really pissing me off

 Yes do see item  in the sciphysics FAQ file  The mass is only
 fundamental and invariant under the new definition  Since most people are
 more familiar with the old definition of mass I claim it's reasonable to use
 the old definition when posting to altatheism

Referring to the rest mass or what I would just call mass as m

The new definition is decades old Anyone who has worked with SR
since then would be familiar with it If most people are familiar
with m  gamma m a highly questionable assertion anyway I would
expect it is on the large part due to learning SR from lousy
popularizations instead of proper textbooks

 In particular as the FAQ points out with mass redefined as a fundamental and
 invariant property E is no longer mc  I suspect that using the new
 definition would cause more confusion than it would remove

Why should we require E  mc even when p   Because it's cute
Saying m  gamma m adds confusion For example people might think
that the formula for kinetic energy still works if m  gaamma m ie
KE   gamma m v  Wrong In fact it's gamma  m c
However if you say p  gamma m v you always get the right answers

In the end it does boil down to a matter of definition You and I
both know what is going on and that is invariant To say that
things actually get heavier when moving fast relative to the observer
misrepresents what is actually going on it is better to say that
momentum  velocity is observed to increase according to an external
observer

But people who haven't studied SR properly will still make mistakes
or miss the point regardless of what you call mass

  You need a gravitational field to curve space not speed relative to
  what
 
 I didn't say it was the speed that was curving space

Yes you did From Irusnewswwmantiscouk

 Again things get tricky when they move fast  Objects get heavier space
 gets curved and reality generally fails to live up to one's expectations

 And the person who takes the undecidable position and says that heshe
 simply disbelieves that the proposition is true is the only one who
 holds no burden of proof  This is why the socalled weak atheist
 position is virtually unassailable  not because it stands on a firm
 foundation of logical argument but because it's proponents simply
 disbelieve in the existence of Gods and therefore they hold no burden
 of proof  When you don't assert anything you don't have to prove
 anything 

Right Why should I assert anything about beings that I don't believe in
When I have no good idea of what this being is like only some 
contradictory statements being made by various religions I cannot 
firmly assert anything specific 

A mathematical atheist has a proof that no godlike beings can exist
However we will first need a definition of 'god' and the theistic
religions do not agree very well on this Did you see my earlier
posting on the existence of god Theists cannot even agree whether
any god exists or metaexists or is herself the existence 
Omnipotence omnibenevolence and omniscience are other concepts
theists do not all agree upon Thus it is hard to assert anything
about a such fluxional beings Deus absconditus remains hidden
from those who believe and from those who don't 

 That's where weak atheism draws its strength  But its
 strength is also its Achilles' heel  Without assertionsaxioms one
 has no foundation upon which to build  As a philosophy it's virtually
 worthless  IMO of course

I have to disagree here  first philosophical maxims are not necessarily
something to build upon What can I build upon Occam's Razor for 
instance Weak atheism is not a philosophy a philosophical system
There are several alternatives from which atheists may choose from
ranging from reductionism my choice to objectivism Actually
philosophy becomes simpler without the additional assumption of gods

Second your claim that being without assertions is an Achilles'
heel of weak atheism sounds strange to me and is actually a version
of the oftheard theistic claim that 'but even atheists have to place their
faith on something even if it is not god' This has been discussed in
the FAQ but from a different viewpoint and I do not repeat it

I think one does not have to take anything on blind faith
True one cannot prove that reality exists independent of the observer
to assume this is not a blind leap of faith at all however It is
probably the simplest assumption one can make after solipsism
of course

   Am I correct then in assuming that that Josephus did in
 fact write about Jesus but Christian copists embellished it

In article Aprulyssesattcom mlsulyssesattcom Michael L Siemon writes
 Correct overstates the case  The whole point of the discussions
 has been that it is reasonable to assume that there was some brief
 reference to Jesus that has been doctored  By consensus this is
 the most reasonable of the proposed solutions  but not so much
 so as to rule out complete fabrication

It is worth noting that the dozen or so references to Jesus
outside of Christian scripture provide us no evidence of what
he taught or what he did beyond the fact that the early
Christians claimed him as their founder  All of the writers must
have received their information from the early Christians
perhaps second or third hand  None of these references give any
hint that the writers had any independent information about
Jesus 

These references do show that the early Christians were having an
influence at least enough to earn a few lines here and there in
other peoples' writings  But the typical use to which they are
put by some Christian apologists in making psuedohistorical
arguments a la Josh is totally specious

I am doing research on atheism part of which involves field research here
on the net  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this
group intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief  I would
seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and
mail it back to me at mtabbottunixamherstedu  

First of all I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a
variety of ways with varying amounts of detail it's possible to give 
succinct answers to most everything but there's enough here to keep most of 
you typing for hours I'm sure  As much detail as you want to give me I mean 
it is great but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of 
individuals as possible so even minimal responses are far better than nothing
 it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration  

Secondly I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious I know that
phrases like What would convince you of the existence of God imply that I am
a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens
In fact I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself so my
use of God is a question of locution rather than ideology  it's easier 
than just repeating a deity or higher power every time  

Also I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system
although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs but
are skeptical towards everything  I understand but you know what I mean
Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases 
required to get the precise idea across  

Lastly thanks  Please fill out as much as you can in as much detail as
you can and send them to me  My research and I thank you  



Where would you place your beliefs on the spectrum 
	Theism  Agnosticism  Weak Atheism  Strong Atheism  
Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs  


In what if any religious tradition were you raised  Did you ever believe 
in the existence of a God  Several of the following questions presume 
that the answer to this is yes if you've always been an atheist or at
least never a theist you may have to modify the questionanswer somewhat


How serious was youryour family's involvement  

How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe  

How and when did your final break with your beliefs if any occur  I 
realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an event per se
whatever the case just describe it in whatever detail you wish  


What contact with other atheists have you had before and after and during
your conversion to atheism  Certainly your involvement with altatheism
counts  how have net discussions affected your beliefs  

To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your
beliefs  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion through
independent means or by some combination of the two or other means  


Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational
means proofs of the nonexistence of God etc or was it perhaps at least 
in part through other means alienation from mainstream religion etc  


To what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your beliefs
What phenomena of the universe and of human existence anything from physical
phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs do you 
feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs and where are they lacking as 
an explanatory method  

What would it take for you to question or change your beliefs  What would
convince you of the existence of God what would convince you of the 
plausibility of God's existence and so forth  How dynamic are your beliefs
 are they constantly changing have they stayed more or less the same for
some time  

Are you involved in a career or education in science  To what extent do you
think science has influenced your beliefs  Issac Asimov claimed that science
was the new secular religion and that scientists are in a very real sense
the new priesthood  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi
religious base or even a religious element  



This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals but
also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose
ideas and histories could be very useful to me  Would you be willing to have
me on the basis of this survey write you to find out more about you and your
beliefs  If not fine your filling out the survey alone is great  



Thanks again  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what
I'm doing with this data or if you have anything to say in addition to what
I've asked about above

Alarming amounts of agreement deleted 

 I made my statement about Ockums Razor from my experiences in physics 
 Thanks for info in Baysian statistics  very interesting and I didn't
 know it before I follow your proof but I have one questions We have
 two hypotheses H and HG  the latter is more complicated which by
 definition means PH  PHG

That complicated isn't in fact where PH  PHG comes from it's more
the other way around It's from

  PH    PHG   PHG'  where G' is the complement of G

and by axiom Panything   so PHG'   so PH  PHG

In a sense HG is necessarily more complicated than H for any H and G
so I may be splitting hairs but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective
of subjective impressions of how complicated something is PH  PHG
holds with equality if and only if PHG'  

 As you point out it's a very simple matter to show Px  H  Px  HG
  PH  x  PHG  x and thus H is to be preferd to HG Now to say
 that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say Px  H   Px  HG
 Can you elaborate some on this

Well Px  A  Px  B means that x is as likely to be observed if A is
operative as it is if B is operative This implies that observing x does not
provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between
the respective possibilities that A and B are operative the difference
reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior
probabilities PA and PB

  Px  A  Px  B  

    PA  x    k PA   and   PB  x    k PB

where k    Px  A  Px    Px  B  Px

So A and B are equally consistent with the data in that observing x
doesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative

In the particular case where A  H and B  HG however we know that their
prior probabilities are ordered by PH  PHG although we don't know
the actual values and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to
throw out any such HG

 Also in the real world it isn't as clear cut and dry it seems 
 to me We can't always determine whether the equality Px  H   
 Px  HG is true 

That's certainly true but the particular point here was whether or
not a divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religion
in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious
implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spreading the word'

Now it seems to me as I've said that the observed variance in religious
belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model but rather
less well if one proposes a divine component' in addition since I would
expect the latter to conspire against wide variance and even mutual
exclusion among beliefs Thus my personal feeling is that Px  HG isn't
even equal to Px  H in this case but is smaller H is memetic transmission
G is divine component' x is the variance among beliefs But I happily
acknowledge that this is a subjective impression

 BTW my beef with your Baysian argument was not a mathematical one  
 I checked most of your work and didn't find an error and you seem very  
 careful so there probably isn't a math mistake I think the mistake
 is philosophical But just to make sure I understand you can please 
 rephrase it in nontechnical terms I think this is a reasonable 
 request  I always try to look for ways of  explaining physics to 
 nonphysicist I'm not a Baysian statistician nor any type of 
 statistician so this would be very helpful 

Not that I'm a statistician as such either but

The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of
the read my' observations to date However theism of the type with
which I am concerned also suggests that for instance prayer may be
answered people may be miraculously healed both are in principle amenable
to statistical verification and that gods may generally intervene in
measurable ways

This means that these regions of the space of possible observations 
which I loosely termed appearances of gods have some nonzero
probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic

Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to
scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism
expends on making appearances of gods possible must come from somewhere
else ie other possible observations

All else being equal this means that an observation which isn't an
appearance of gods must have a slightly higher probability under
atheism than under theism The Bayesian stuff implies that such
observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of
the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a corresponding decrease
in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis

Sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque but it's rather difficult to
put it any other way since it does depend intimately on the properties
of conditional probability densities and particularly that the total
area under them is always unity

An analogy may or may not  be helpful Say that hypothesis A is the
coin is fair and that B is the coin is unfair twoheaded I've
used A and B to avoid confusion with Hheads and Ttails

Then

  PH  A      total 
  PT  A    

  PH  B        total 
  PT  B      

The observations are a string of heads with no tails This is compatible
with both a fair coin A and a twoheaded coin B However the probability
expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails even though they
don't actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must
be unity and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance
of heads

Say our running estimates at time n are enA and enB The
observation xn at time n is another head xn  H The estimates are
modified according to

                            PH  A
  enA      enA        enA  m
                              PH

and

                            PH  B
  enB      enB        enB  m
                              PH

Now we don't know PH the actual prior probability of a head but
the multiplier for eA is half that for eB This is true every time
the coin is tossed and a head is observed

Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates after n heads we have

                 n
  enA      m  eA

and
                    n
  enB      m  eB

and since ekA  ekB   at any time k you can show that   m  
and thus   m   Hence the estimate for the faircoin hypothesis A must
decrease at each trial and that for the twoheaded coin hypothesis B must
increase even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads

The loose analogy is between unfair coin and atheism and between fair
coin and theism with observations consistent with both A tail which
would falsify unfair coin is analogous to an appearance of gods
which would falsify atheism I am not claiming that the analogy extends
to the numerical values of the various probabilities just that the principle
is the same

 Constant observation of no evidence for gods if evidence for them 
                                                
 is at all possible under the respective theisms constantly increases
  
 the notional estimated probability that they don't exist 

 It's important to draw a distinction between theism that could
 be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can't
 Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible
 it doesn't make sense to say lack of evidence supports the contrary 
 view

Quite so but this type of theism is what I might call the G in the HG
in terms of our Ockham's Razor discussion and I'd bin it on those grounds

 So it depends upon your conception of this god If it's a conception 
 like Zeus who happened to come down to earth to play quite 
 frequently then I agree with you  lack of evidence for this conception 
 of god is evidence that it does not exist But if your conception
 of God is one that does not make falsifiable predictions see below
 on falsifiable predictions then I disagree  lack of evidence
 does not support a disbelief 

The hypotheses don't have to be falsifiable and indeed in my model'
the theism isn't falsifiable

 

 I used the phrase SHOULD obverse Given any specific 'x' theism 
 does not make the prediction Px  Ht   That's why I used the 
 word should  theism makes no predictions about any specific event
 I can only say I believe that God did such and such after such
 and such happens or I believe God will do such and such But
 for any given 'x' I can never a priori say Px  Ht   I can
 not even say this for the set of all 'x' or some 'x' This is what 
 don't like about your use of probability We also have no way of
 assigning these probabilities  I hold science to positivistic
 criteria  if someone cannot tell me how to measure even in principle
 Px  H then probability is not applicable to hypothesis H Such
 is the case when H  Ht theistic and Ha atheistic For example
 Px  Ha  Px  HaPHa What is PHa How do I measure it 

You don't have to We don't need in the above analogy to know any
prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the
faircoin hypothesis is less than unity and that the corresponding
multiplier for the twoheaded coin hypothesis is greater than unity
You don't need to know the initial values of the running estimates
either It's clear that after a large number of observations Pfaircoin
approaches zero and Ptwoheadedcoin approaches unity

All you need to know is whether Px  Ha is larger than Px  Ht for
observed x and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain
events rendered possible not necessary under Ht which are not possible
under Ha and all else is equal

 Baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations But
 what if the hypothesis isn't amenable to observation And even for
 statements that are amenable to observation some observations are
 not relevant  a sequence of observations must be chosen with care
 I'm curious to know what types of observations xx you have 
 in mind concerning theism and atheism

Any observations you like it really doesn't matter nor affect the
reasoning provided that there are some possible observations which
would count as appearances of gods Examples of this might be
a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of
revelation

 But any statement about Px  H for general x still counts as a 
 prediction of H If the theism in question Ht says that prayer may 
 be answered or that miracles may happen see my interpretation quoted 
 again above of what God exists' means then this is a prediction 
 Px  Ht   for such x It's what distinguishes it from the atheist 
 hypothesis Ha which predicts that this stuff does not happen Px  Ha
   for such x

 Theism does not make the claim that Px  Ht   for such x
 Or I should say that my theism doesn't Maybe I was too quick to
 say we had a common language You said that by the existence of God 
 you mean the notion that the deity described by the Bible and by 
 Christians does interact with the universe as claimed by those agents
 I agreed with this However I must be careful here I BELIEVE
 this  I'm not making any claims Maybe I should have changed does
 to can  there is an important shift of emphasis But any way
 since I only have a belief I cannot conclude Px  Ht   for 
 such x

OK we'll downgrade does interact to may interact which would
actually be better since does interact implies a falsifiability which
we both agree is misplaced

 I don't think my theism makes predictions Maybe I'm not
 understanding what you mean by prediction  could you explain what
 you mean by this word

I'll explain but bear in mind that this isn't central all I require of
a theism is that it not make the prediction Appearances of gods will
never happen as does atheism Before somebody points out that quantum
mechanics doesn't make this prediction either the difference is that
QM and atheism do not form a partition

Predictions include such statements as Prayer is efficacious implying
If you do the stats you will find that Prayer is efficacious or Prayer
is not efficacious or Verily I say unto you This generation shall not
pass till all these things be fulfilled I don't think we have any problems
of misunderstanding here

 Persistent observation of this stuff not happening consistent with
 Ht though it may be is more consistent with Ha as explained in the
 Bayesian stats post 

 Even if Ht God exists is unfalsifiable that's
 no problem for my argument other than that you have to let the number 
 of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically 

 BTW I do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of 
 observations as valid  or rather that part of the argument is not valid 
 We as existing humans can never make an infinite number of measurments 
 and any conclusion that reilies on this I don't accept as valid

That's fine I don't claim that theism is false merely that the finite
number of observations available to me so far suggest that it is and
that as I continue to observe the suggestion looks better and better

 Renormalization stuff deleted

 In the Bayesian stats post I assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable
 in a finite number of observations Here's the relevant quote
 
  The important assumption is that there are some observations which 
  are compatible with the theist hypothesis and not with the atheist 
  hypothesis and thus would falsify atheism these are what I called 
 appearances of gods' but this need not be taken too literally Any 
  observation which requires for its explanation that one or more gods 
  exist will count All other observations are assumed to be compatible 
  with both hypotheses This leaves theism as unfalsifiable and atheism 
  as falsifiable in a single observation only by such appearances of 
  gods'

 Here is my problem with this For something to be falsifiable it
 must make the prediction that 'x' should not be seen If 'x' is 
 seen then the hypothesis has been falsified Now atheism is a word 
 in oposition to something  theism A theism aserts a  belief and an 
 atheism aserts a disbelief So there are certain atheisms that are 
 certainly falsifiable  just as there are certain theisms that are 
 falsifable eg if my theism asserts the world is only  years 
 old and that God does not decieve then this has been falsified However 
 the atheism that is in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism is also 
 unfalsifiable I could be wrong on this statment  contd

I think you are an appearance of gods is sufficient to falsify
atheism whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable

 I'll think more about it Until then here is a general question
 Suppse X were unfalsifiable Is notX also unfalsifiable 

No by way of a counterexample let X  the coin is fair or more
accurately so that notX makes sense the two sides of the coin are
different This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin even a string of
heads is consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite
number of tosses to falsify X in the limit Its converse is falsifiable
and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared

 This is partly what's wrong with you Baysian argument  which 
 requires observations x  xn to be made There are simply 
 no such observations that have a truth value in relation to the 
 statement God exists Now by use of your symmetry argument I 
 can understand why someone would say Since the statement 
 'God does not exist'
   
 makes no predictions I will choose not to believe it But none
 the less this would be founded on a type of faith  or if you don't
 like the word faith insert belief for which there is no falsifiable
 evidence instead 

 I'll assume you meant God exists' up there at the highlight But by our
 agreed definition of exists the statement makes predictions as I said
 above although it isn't falsifiable in a finite number of observations

 Actually I mean 'God does not exist' makes no predictions

Oops Sorry Mea culpa

 The truth of this statment actually depends upon which god you are
 refering to But I can think of some conceptions of God for which 
 it is true But once again I'm open to the posibility that I could
 be wrong So give me some examples of predictions of the statment
 God does not exist Here is one that I can think of If true then 
 there would be no healing or miricles But this can in principle never 
 be determined one way or the other There are cases in which people 
 seem to recover and are healed without the help of a doctor and for no  
 known reason These situations do in fact happen They are consistent
 with a theistic hypothesis but IN NO WAY support such a hypothesis

We agree here

 They are not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesis I can't
 think of one prediction from 'God does not exist' that isn't of
 this type But I might be missing something 

The Rapture will not happen on October   Said Rapture would have
falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened although its failure
to happen does not of course falsify any theisms other than those which
specifically predicted it

No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its
explanation will ever be observed That about sums the whole thing up

Omigod it's an operationalist Sorry Jim but the idea that a theory
explaining a myriad of distinctly different observations is merely a
model is more than sensible people can accept  your phobia about
objective reality notwithstanding

First of all I have no phobia of objective reality  I'm simply
saying that the scientific model of the atom is probably not 
what is really out there  I'm not saying that there's no object
that sources these properties we measure from atomic theory

Take light as another example  There are two theories particle and
wave  Each one fails to predict the behavior of light as some point
So which is it particle or wave  You tell me  You're the sensible
one

What is the fact of evolution  There is a difference between calling evolution a
fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing facts I happen to think
the latter is more accurate   And you said it best yourself If you assess 
the theories of evolution objectively  Why didn't you say  If you assess

  Yes do see item  in the sciphysics FAQ file  The mass is only
  fundamental and invariant under the new definition  Since most people are
  more familiar with the old definition of mass I claim it's reasonable to u
  the old definition when posting to altatheism
 
 Referring to the rest mass or what I would just call mass as m
 
 The new definition is decades old Anyone who has worked with SR
 since then would be familiar with it

Er I'm afraid not  The Cambridge time retardation effect unfortunately
spreads out as far as the Physics labs and certainly as of  the old
definition was still in use when teaching students

 both know what is going on and that is invariant To say that
 things actually get heavier when moving fast relative to the observer
 misrepresents what is actually going on

Well yes but almost any description of physics in plain English will
misrepresent it to some degree

                                             it is better to say that
 momentum  velocity is observed to increase according to an external
 observer

Except that momentum is no longer taught in GCSE physics because it was felt
to be too difficult

   You need a gravitational field to curve space not speed relative to
   what
  
  I didn't say it was the speed that was curving space
 
 Yes you did From Irusnewswwmantiscouk
 
  Again things get tricky when they move fast  Objects get heavier space
  gets curved and reality generally fails to live up to one's expectations

Yeah and I was claiming that speed causes disappointment too 

Thinking about it a much more interesting distortion would probably be the
visual effect of having the universe seemingly compress itself into the front
of your field of view and frequency shift all over the place which I seem to
remember is what happens at those speeds  At least you'd see it unlike
the curvature of spacetime  What the hell is this doing in talkabortion

I think you have been engaging in the fallacy of false dichotomy you have
consistently characterized sciencereligion as rationalismnonsense when
in fact the latter do not form a complete set of options  Neither do the
former for that matter

Gregg so would you consider that Rushdie would now be left alone

Tammy is this all explicitly stated in the bible or do you assume
that you know that Ezekiel indirectly mentioned It could have been
another metaphor for instance Ezekiel was mad at his landlord so he
talked about him when he wrote about the prince of Tyre

Sorry but my interpretation is more mundane Ezekiel wrote about

Jastrow's position is specious Stanley's ideas are fiction Durant

Are we witnessing the founding of a new major religion or has
it really been there all along


Let me try again

The doubt that has infiltrated the previous smugly confident certitude
of evolutionary biology has inflamed passions  There is lack of agreement

 If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that 

 	Because social pressure is the most powerful force known to
 man How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness of
 established religion is anything other than social convention One
 way is to assert that there are moral universals But that is not
 the same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origen
 to trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties

 What right do
 we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality

 	We expect empathy from our fellow man We expect to raise each
 generation with values that we live by those which assure that mistakes
 we have made are not repeated Do you think that mere authority checks
 all tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life I think not In fact
 authority is power and power corrupts The most powerful tend to think
 that they are above the law that applies to everybody else Religious
 authority theocarcy has not mitigated this any better than other
 power structures on this score and it seems that because there are no
 checks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abuses
 recorded by history are greater

 	We live and teach morals by setting an example starting in
 the home This does not come from books or authority figures in
 soceity If people are weak or confused at the present time it is
 not because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by some
 mysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulas
 will repair That is but magical and simplistic thinking We need to
 look at forces in the way we live even the good things that happen
 in our present culture that are weakening the family as the primary
 means we have to teach children values Of course people are trying
 to have the community do things that once were done in the family
 alone This may not be as effective We need to look at this



 	Laying down the law and with teeth doesn't stop the crazy
 man from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law It
 may help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact but it
 may not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy people
 from murduring

Bruce

   It seems like you are advocating social change based on your
concept of human nature and that concept seems pretty Utopian It's
obvious from even a cursory study of history that no system
regardless of the authority it may claim for its basis will make
people act any better Until human nature changes the products of our
nature won't change and that has to include society I think your
assessment of human potential in this regard is too optimistic

   What is needed is an absolute moral standard if all people are to
create any Utopias By implying a Utopian future you also argue for
an absolute standard that applies to everyone in every case I realize
that you may not acknowledge the connection but it's there

 Would you care to explain why it was that when I said  I hope an

 Yes sure because the only obvious reason anyone would make the jump from
 BCCI to Islamic bank is by associating Islamic banking with muslim 
 ownership

But in this case I said I hoped that BCCI was not an Islamic bank

 And the only reason one would generalize from a given
 Islamic bank to all Islamic banks is through a stereotype  one
 X is bad therefore all X's are bad

But in this case I said I hoped that BCCI was not an Islamic bank

 Next think you know there is a Bosnia on tap

 What do you mean  Would your idea still apply if I said I think it is ok to 
 kill you because that is what I decided

What I mean is what I said   What I want does not automatically
translate into what I think is right   That is it does not 
translate that way for me

If you reply that I think it is ok to kill you because that is what

It just doesn't translate that way for me

  Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others
  How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference
 
 Which goes faster a bullet or a snail  How come you can answer that when
 Einstein proved that there isn't an objective frame of reference
 
 Not that Einstein proved anything

Oh yes he did  You may not agree with his premises and what he proved may
not apply to reality if such a thing exists but he certainly proved
something

                                        but you can't answer it and your 
 answer be in general true

Got it in one  Similarly a moral relativist will not judge one moral system
to be better than another in every possible circumstance  This does not
however preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another
in a specific set of circumstances  Nor does it preclude a set of moral
relativists from collectively judging a moral system from some set of
circumstances which they all agree they are in

OK this makes sense to me  I'm serious you've explained something
to me which I never understood before  But just for grins suppose we
almost all agree that we are in a set of circumstances called reality  What
then  Or say for all practical intents and purposes there is no frame
of reference in which thus and such is good isn't that approximately
objective in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to
outrun a snail  For example if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area
isn't it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act even
though there conceivably might be some tailend case that would justify it

                             And even that statement assumes an
 objective reality independent of our beliefs about it

Eh  Could you explain this  Which that statement are you talking about

My own above you can't answer

  And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
  it isn't an objective reality for values
 
 I'm sorry I can't parse an objective reality for values  Could you try
 again
 
 san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face
 of disagreement

I still don't quite see what you're trying to say  I assume by values you
mean moral values yes  In which case what do you mean by real  What is
a real moral value as opposed to an unreal one

I mean to say that values are as real as horses whatever you understand
by a horse being real is pretty much what I mean about a value being real

 If you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in
 your opinion then all you get is infinite regress

Sorry but in what way is it an infinite regress  It looks extremely finite
to me

I meant that it's never more than your opinion  You've clarified this
for me above  My understanding is now that if a supermajority of relativists
agree that thus and such is wrong in almost any or all frames of reference
then they're saying something which is to all practical intents and purposes
no different than what I'm saying

                                                    What you do not get
 is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
 is inferior to that of the man of peace

Sorry but that's not so  I can provide a justification for asserting that
the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace  I
just can't provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances

Logically possible or actually possible  By which I mean are you
stretching possible to include events such as the atoms in my terminal
switching places so that the terminal turns upside down or do you
think it likely that circumstances will arise in which terrorism is
superior to peace  Really what I'm after is some order of magnitude
on the probability you put on 'possible'

reply to cobbalexialisuiucedu Mike Cobb
 
If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that What
right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally
mandated morality  Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your
brother and say that I was exercising my rights as I saw them was
doing what felt good didn't want anyone forcing their morality on me
or I don't follow your morality 
 
I believe that morality is subjective  Each person is entitled to his
own moral attitudes  Mine are not a priori more correct than someone
elses  This does not mean however that I must judge another on the
basis of his rather than my moral standards  While he is entitled to
believe what his own moral sense tells him the rest of society is
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is
offensive to the majority

Why  Your last statement  Why  By which authority  

Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral  The may realize that
it is immoral and not care  They are thus not following their own moral
system but being immoral  For someone to lay claim to an alternative
moral system he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be
internally consistent  

Why  Your last statement  Why are these things necessary  

And believe me a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly
consistent

Some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and
thus may be incapable of behaving morally  While someone like Hitler
may have believed that his actions were moral we may judge him immoral
by our standards  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean
that we must excuse the murderer

Trouble is this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler too
I do not mean any comparison or offence David   Try substituting 
the social minority of your choice for 'sociopath' 'Hitler'  and
'murderer'  No logical difference  Someone like you vs someone like
Hitler Zero sum

Faith and dogma are dangerous
 
Agreed
 
A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change
his mind whereas a Christian cannot due to the nature of faith and
dogma present in any religion
 
It is hard for me to understand but quite a few professional scientists
and philosophers are theists
 
Sure religion has many good qualities  It encourages benevolence and
philanthropy
 
But also intolerance and superstition  I'm not sure that in the balance
it is not detrimental

    Now that has always confused me  Once a black hole forms I don't see 
  how
  anything could pass the event horizon perhaps including the original 
  mass 
  that formed is forming the black hole in the first place

    Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever 
  faster towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space 
  caused by the excessive gravity as the object approaches the event 
  horizon 
  it has further to travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach 
  the 
  event horizon of   
  infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

It seems to me that you are misusing physical intuition here  My point is
that you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomena
inappropriately  Remember that there is no such thing as a global frame
of reference for time  Our minds like to pretend that there is and we 
imagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx  years off 
from ours on Earth
This is simply wrong  There is NO global time which can be applied to
events on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth  This is what
Special Relativity has taught us  If I am travelling past the Earth at
a high rate of speed toward AC I can even have a different view of the 
order of the occurance of events on AC versus Earth  Thus the answer to 
the question what's happening on Alpha Centaury NOW is NOT welldefined if
asked on Earth until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relative
velocities and the like AND it will have different answers for different 
values of these parameters
Now in the vicinity of a black hole the curvature of spacetime becomes 
important enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes 
very important  In particular the frame used by a distant observer is quite 
different from the frame appropriate to the falling object  Our minds just 
don't seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be 
behaving differently in these two locations but the equations of relativity 
say that it does  We would like to say the falling object is hovering
above the horizon NOW for an object whose frame has rotated wholly away
from ours  In a very real sense once the object has fallen into the hole
its gone forever from our ken  Unless you volunteer to jump in after it
that is

      Point Morals are in essence personal opinions Usually
ideally wellfounded motivated such but nonetheless personal The
fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question
sometimes even for the same reason does not make morals objective it
makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question
which can be good for the evolution of a social species

And if a real large lot nice phrase of people agree that there is a
football on a desk I'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two
Perhaps you can explain the difference to me since you seem to see it
so clearly

rest deleted
 
That's a fallacy and it is not the first time it is pointed out
For one you have never given a set of morals people agree upon Unlike
a football Further you conveniently ignore here that there are
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something The analogy
does not hold
 
One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football
while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
with a set of morals YOU have to give
 
Further the above is evidence not proof Proof would evolve out of testing
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories
 
 
The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer
the objections Evidence that you are a preacher

Frank relativism is not keen to make such judgements unlike

The problem is that there are so many competing objective moral

Maybe I should not mention the 'magical word' that describes

Theism is correlated with fanaticism I have neither said that all fanatism
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism The point is
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic One could of course
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but I just
have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it

IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered
 
Bogus I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism
The point is that theism is a factor
 
 
Gullibility
blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more
reliable indicators  And the really dangerous people  the sources of
fanaticism  are often none of these things  They are cynical manipulators
of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing
 
That's a claim you have to support Please note that especially in the
field of theism the leaders believe what they say
 
 
Now some
brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism
I grant you  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned
argument  and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom  Ever read Animal Farm

 
That's a straw man And as usually in discussions with you one has to
repeat it Read what I have written above not every theism leads to
fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism The point is
there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism
 
Gullibility by the way is one of them
 
 
And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
men Interesting that you have nothing better to offer
 
 
  Define irrational belief  eg is it rational to believe that
     reason is always useful


Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason The latter has
been discussed for a long time with Charley Wingate One point is that
the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information

Well there is a glaring paradox here  an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would
be irrational  Which is it

 
That's bogus Self reference is not circular And since the evaluation of
usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed
 
Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics
and mathematics are therfore circular
 
 
The first part of the second statement contains no information because
you don't say what the beliefs are  If the beliefs are strong theism
andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true  The
second part of your sentence is patently false  counterexample an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it

 
I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions
of god here
 
An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here
is a an often refuted fallacy Have a look at the discussion of the
axiom of choice And further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems
out of which they are usually derived I exist is derived if you want
it that way
 
Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms
 
what is it you are trying to say
 
 
Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational

I can't agree with this until you are specific  which theism  To
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
I suspect you do not have

 
Using the traditonal definition of gods Personal supernatural entities
with objective effects on this world Usually connected to morals andor
the way the world works
 
 
The affinity to fanatism is easily seen It has to be true because I believe
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis However the beliefs say they are
more than a work hypothesis

I don't understand this  Can you formalise your argument
 
Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice That does not make
B true it is at best a work hypothesis However the content of B is that
it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis Testing or evaluating
evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B already believed
says it is wronG a waste  of time not possible Depending on the further
contents of B AmalekitesIdolatersProtestants are to be killed this can
have interesting effects

Would you like to argue that Western policies are in fact completely
harmless to the people of the Third World  Or even beneficial  If so star
a thread about it  I can't imagine how you'll support the contention but
I'm happy to discuss it
 
 This is sort of like asking an atheist would you like to prove that God
 doesn't exist  Doubting something does not imply affirming the contrary

Funny we've been here before  What was the issue last time

It is of course logically reasonable to doubt X even when you have no
evidence of notX  Carry on doubting everything you want  It is noticable to
me however that you only ever seem to follow this course when you want to
do so for the sake of an argument

 Oh goody I get to defend China again on altatheism Just exactly what
 'policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet' are we talking about here
 What are the words 'policy' and 'mandatory' doing there  you mean there
 is a law requiring all or even some ethnically Tibetan babies to be
 aborted Just how many are we talking about Hundred Dozens One or two
 You are aware of course that even in the days when the one child policy was
 enforced the Tibetans and all other ethnic minorities were exempt Of course
 you do And you are aware that if the Chinese wanted to kill all the Tibetans
 they have lots of better means and they have had a rather long time in which
 to do it But for some reason there seems to be more Tibetans now than at any
 other time Odd for a people supposedly suffering a 'policy of mandatory
 forced abortion'

 Don't suppose you care to provide a credible citation

Read your own newspapers  I don't have the space to keep them all  If I
kept enough records to be able to respond with a couple of pages of citations
every time some idiot said Nyaah nyaah prove it gimme a citation I
wouldn't have any space left in my flat  It's enough work to track down
references to prove that George Bush really said atheists shouldn't be
considered citizens or that Einstein wasn't a Christian and those used to
get demanded every week

And I suspect if I did track down the various issues of The Guardian which
have carried detailed reports on the subject you'd dismiss them as liberal
propaganda just like Gregg dismisses the articles about Islam in The Times

Did you miss Amnesty International's widelyannounced report about torture in
China  It was in the news a couple of weeks ago  Oh I forgot that's just
liberal propaganda  I mean is it plausible that the country responsible for
the Tienanmen Square massacre would torture and kill people  Naaah  Forget
it

Keep up the good work  I'm sure China's Most Favoured Nation status will
be renewed in June and you can feel really proud

  And I agree  I think you merely misunderstood the point I was trying to

  with  For instance we talk about electron pairs and draw diagrams of
  molecules with little markings to show these pairs of electrons  This is
  actually nonsense but it's a perfectly good model for predicting all kinds
  of chemical reactions
 
 Your original posting shows that you seem to think chemists still think
 this way It is true that basic chemistry is still taught in terms of
 electron pairs and valences but this is not what chemists are taught 
 and this is not how they should think 

What is the difference between a chemist and someone who is taught
Chemistry at say Cambridge University

 I suggest you take a look at PW Atkins's classic text Physical Chemistry
 th ed Oxford University Press  to see how chemistry is taught today

Has there been some revolution in teaching methods in the last four years

Perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that I was thinking of organic
chemistry whereas you were thinking of physical chemistry

To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist is really
asking too much you would have existence depend on grammar All you
can really say is that something is poorly defined but that in itself
is insufficient to decide anything other than confusion of course

 
It is not a question of grammar it is a question of modelling Has been
discussed in the wonderful time when you were not posting to this group
When A is contradictorily defined A does not point to an instance in
reality Unless there is more information in the definition of A that
allows me to find it somehow However when the contradictory attribute
is said to be essential ie has not got that attribute  not the A I
am looking for I can conclude that A does not exist
 
 
Your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief

 I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made
 which affect the lives of innocent people  But I do regret the 
 circumstances which make those decisions necessary and I regret the
 suffering caused by those decisions  

I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you  Don't worry though as a Loving
Christian I guarantee that I will regret the fact that I have to kill
you although I won't regret the actual killing

 If we hadn't intervened allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would
 have been appeasement
 
 Right  But did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action  Or
 are you just setting up a strawman
 
 I'm not setting up a strawman at all  If you want to argue against the
 war then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep
 Kuwait

False dichotomy

 Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective

That's because they weren't even attempted

 But what about those who didn't support Hitler's dreams of conquest  It's
 not as if they democratically voted for all his policies  The NSDAP got
   in the elections of  and that was the last chance the German 
 people got to vote on the matter
 
 They suffered along with the rest  Why does this bother you so much

You want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were
maimed or killed by bombing at the end of WW when it was far from clear
that such bombing was necessary

 The world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect  Many
 innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others  It it regretable
 but that's TheWayItIs

And whyisitthatway  Who set things up to be that way

 this was happening before the Gulf War  Why didn't we send in the bombers 
 to East Timor  Why aren't we sending in the bombers NOW
 
 Probably because we're not the saviors of the world  We can't police each
 and every country that decides to selfdestruct or invade another

No just the ones that have oil  Or the ones that look like they might make
a success of Communism

 Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet East Timor or
 some other places

I don't see that getting UN forces to East Timor is any harder than getting
them to Iraq

            Tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed  Amnesty
 International recently reported that torture is still widespread in China
 
 Why aren't we stopping them  In fact why are we actively sucking up to
 them by trading freely with them
 
 Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it  I for one do not
 agree with the present US policy of sucking up to them as you put it
 I agree that it is deplorable

Fine  Write to your Congressman and to President Clinton  China's status as
Most Favoured Nation comes up for renewal in June  Point out that the US
shouldn't be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime

I doubt anything will happen  Clinton's keener on trade sanctions against
Europe

 Unbelievable comments about the Rodney King case deleted 

 The media is not totally monolithic  Even though there is a prevailing
 liberal bias programs such as the MacNeilLehrer News Hour try to give
 a balanced and fair reporting of the news  There are even conservative
 sources out there if you know where to look  Hurrah for Rush

Any idea how many kill files you just ended up in

 I an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people
 
 You a supposed Christian are arguing that it's OK to kill innocent people
 so long as you get some guilty ones as well
 
 Hardly  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing tm to kill innocent people
 if the end is just  Unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world and
 there are no perfect solutions  If one is going to  resist tyranny then
 innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die  I didn't say
 it is OK  it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary

The ends justify the means eh

 You having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that I
 am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the
 War  
 
 You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist

The same tired old misunderstanding  Moral relativism means that there is no
objective standard of morality  It doesn't mean you can't judge other
people's morals  Christ on a bike how many times have we tried to hammer
that into your head

 Where's your Christian love  Where's your absolute morality  Oh how 
 quick you are to discard them when it suits you  As Ivan Stang would say
 Jesus would puke
 
 One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action
 even this discourse in this forum  I understand the full ramifications of
 that and I am prepared to do so  I don't believe that you can make the
 same claim

Obviously not as I am an atheist  I don't think you'd get on with Jesus
though he was a longhaired lunatic peacenik was he not

 And BTW the reason I brought up the blanketbombing in Germany was
 because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being 
 so deplorable  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
 wasn't accurate enough to hit industrialmilitary targets in a
 decisive way by any other method at that time  But in the Gulf War
 precision bombing was the norm  So the point was why make a big
 stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted
 in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians
 proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing
 in WW

Right  Unfortunately for you it turned out that my opinions on the matter
were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too

I think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing
policy too  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets
and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door  As I
understand it that is not the case we aimed deliberately at civilian
targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the
German people

 civilians suffer  But less civilians suffered in this war than
 any other iany other in history

Oh come on  With wars like the Falklands fresh in people's minds that sort
of propaganda isn't going to fool anyone

                                                       The stories
 of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk
 Yes bunk  The US lost  servicemen in WW over four years
 and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting

Yes  And what about the millions of casualties the Russians suffered  It's
hardly surprising the US didn't lose many men in WW given that you turned
up late

 Mathew I agree  This it seems is the crux of your whole position
 isn't it  That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him arms
 to fight Iran  I agree  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those
 who did or do  But we did sell arms to Hussein and it's a done deal
 Now he invades Kuwait  So do we just sit back and say Well we sold
 him all those arms I suppose he just wants to use them now  Too bad
 for Kuwait  No unfortunately sitting back and letting things be
 is not the way to correct a former mistake  Destroying Hussein's
 military potential as we did was the right move  But I agree with
 your statement Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to
 sell arms to Hussein

But it's STILL HAPPENING  That's the entire point  Only last month John
Major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of
arms to Saudi Arabia  The same month we sold jet fighters to the same
Indonesian government that's busy killing the East Timorese

It's all very well to say Oops we made a booboo better clean up the
mistake but the US and UK keep making the same mistake  They do it so
often that I can't believe it's not deliberate  This suspicion is reinforced
by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit
economy reliant on arms sales

                            So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor
 so much it was the US's and the West's shortsightedness in selling
 arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable right

No I thought both were terrible

 really can't respond but another poster who supports Khomeini has
 responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry This should
 be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist
 modes of obfuscationism 

Don't mind my saying this but the best example of obfuscation is to
condemn without having even your most basic facts straight If you
want some examples go back and look at your previous posts where
you manage to get your facts wrong about the fatwa and Khomeini's 
supposed infallibility

Why shouldn't I mind It sounds as if you are proceeding with just
the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of I always preceeded
my statements with it is my understanding that Now I have made
my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and 
with Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility After hearing your
seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim
regarding himself I have withdrawn that portion of my statement
regarding that claim However I have received no such response
regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams There is nothing
obfuscationist about my claims which are always made clearly
 
I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams
but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and 
other such opaque concepts often used by people to camoflage the 
baselessness of their positions particularly in matters of theology
These are just the sorts of concepts used by Christian churches

 I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how
 deviant the view as I've articulated it above which may not be
 the true view of Khomeini is from the basic principles of Islam 
 So that the nonmuslim readers of this group will see how far from 
 the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them And 
 if they are not in contradiction with the basics of Islam how 
 subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while 
 they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an

Discussing it here is fine by me Shall we start a new thread called
say Infallibility in Islam and move the discussion there

I think this should be illuminating to all Let me make a first
suggestion When Arabic words especially technical ones become of use 
let us define them for those especially atheists to whom they may not be
terribly familiar Please also note that though I did initially refer
to Khomeini as a heretic for what I understood to be a claim  rejected 
by you since  of personal infallibility I withdraw this as a basis
for such a statement I conditionally retain this reference in regard
to Khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the 
socalled Twelve Imams which is in clear conflict with the Qur'an 
in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example
higher than that of the Muhammad in that the Qur'an shows that the
Prophet was clearly fallible as well as it appears given your
abstruse theological statment regarding the natures  of the Twelve
Imams placing them in a different metaphysical category than the 
remainder of humanity with the possible exception of Muhammad 
something which verges on the sin of association

O'Dwyer says

   
Specifically I'd like to know what relativism concludes when two
people grotesquely disagree  Is it

a Both are right

b One of them is wrong and sometimes though perhaps rarely we have a
    pretty good idea who it is

c One of them is wrong but we never have any information as to who so
    we make our best guess if we really must make a decision

d The idea of a right moral judgement is meaningless implying that
     whether peace is better than war eg is a meaningless question
     and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer

e Something else  A short positive assertion would be nice

As I hope you can tell b and c are actually predicated on
the assumption that values are real   so statements like these
can't consistently derive from the relativist assumption that values
aren't part of objective reality

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question but the way you
phrase the question makes it unanswerable  The concepts of right
and wrong or correctincorrect or truefalse belong to the
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions  It makes no
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong although it is
legitimate to ask if it is good or better than another position

Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives
of epistemology and ethics  perception and motivation respectively
One can certainly ask if a percept is right correct true
veridical or wrong incorrect false illusory  But it makes little
sense to ask if a motive is true or false  On the other hand it is
strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil but one can
certainly ask that question about motives

Therefore your suggested answers ac simply can't be considered
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment

True by correct I mean the thing valued is really good  I should
use evaluative terms but I don't always  Sorry for the sloppy phrasing
Can you answer if betterness is used in in place of correctness

Now the problem with d is that it is doublebarrelled  I agree with
the first part that the rightness of a moral position is a
meaningless question for the reasons stated above  But that is
irrelevant to the alleged implication not an implication at all that
one cannot feel peace is better than war  I certainly can make
value judgments bad better best without asserting the correctness
of the position

You can never say that the thing is really better or more likely
to better from all realistic frames of reference


Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ad  My short e answer is
that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue
neither is right correct or wrong incorrect  They simply hold
different moral values feelings

This is where my difficulty arises though I'm starting to get
in now  The thing is there isn't anything simple about different
moral values when those values are human rights

 Well I can cut to the chase and admit that what I find least attractive 
 about realtivism is that it elevates the heinous to the level of the good 
 by saying in effect to each his own or what's good for you  isn't good
 for me  Thus the terrorist is elevated to the same level as the man
 of peace

So then I assume that you feel that there is an objective definition for
terrorist

Not necessarily but I believe that some people really are terrorists
and some people really are people of peace  I prefer the peaceful folk
to the terrorists and even though I don't claim to have lock on which is which 
I have hope in our ability to tell them apart and it would be insane not to 
try

      Point Morals are in essence personal opinions Usually
ideally wellfounded motivated such but nonetheless personal The
fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question
sometimes even for the same reason does not make morals objective it
makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question
which can be good for the evolution of a social species

And if a real large lot nice phrase of people agree that there is a
football on a desk I'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two
Perhaps you can explain the difference to me since you seem to see it
so clearly

rest deleted
 
That's a fallacy and it is not the first time it is pointed out

It's not a fallacy  note the IF   IF a supermajority of disinterested people 
agree on a fundamantal value we're not doing ethics YET Benedikt then what 
is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial
observation

For one you have never given a set of morals people agree upon Unlike
a football Further you conveniently ignore here that there are
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something The analogy
does not hold

I have however given an example of a VALUE people agree on and explained
why  People will agree that their freedom is valuable  I have also
stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective
ethics  the IF assertion above  And that is what I'm talking about there
isn't a point in talking about ethics if this can't be agreed

One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football
while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
with a set of morals YOU have to give

I'm not doing morals ethics if we can't get past values  As I say
the only cogent objection to my 'freedom' example is that maybe people
aren't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable
Maybe not and I want to think about this some especially the implications
of its being true

Further the above is evidence not proof Proof would evolve out of testing
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories

Garbage  That's not proof either

The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer
the objections Evidence that you are a preacher

Name that fallacy

Evolution as I have said before is theory and fact  It is exactly

I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either  
deletions

Jim  we essentially agree except about the definition of fact
The scientific definition of fact is not the ultimate truth but
rather a theory which is so supported by evidence and so predictive
that it is pointless to test it anymore

So we have the fact of evolution and we have theories of evolution
just as we have the fact of gravity and theories of gravity and
the fact of the atomic nature of matter and atomic theory  The fact
of evolution is that the current diversity of life arose through
common descent  this is so supported by the evidence that no one ever
bothers to try to test it anymore  Theories of evolution include
theories regarding the mechanism of common descent natural selection
vs drift or the actual pathways of evolution or any number of
other things  These are constantly being tested because the actual
mechanisms etc behind the fact of common descent are still up for
question

Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory  In other words it
could theoretically still be falsified and rejected  But since it's
so predictive and so consistently supported by evidence it seems
pointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore

description of atomic theory and alternative theories of gravity deleted
Both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it

Here is where you fail to make an important distinction  You have
shoehorned the facts of the existence of gravity and atoms and
evolution into one category with the theories which have been
proposed to explain the mechanisms  The existence of these things
is so predictive as to be considered fact  The mechanisms on the
other hand are still worth discussing

CJF lots of wars very OT  No one has ever found any metal swords or

I was talking to the head of the archeology dept once in college and
the topic of Mormon archeology came up  It seems that the Mormon church
is or was big on giving grants to archeologists to prove that the
native Americans are really the lost tribe of Israel and other such
bunk  The archeologists would shake their head knowingly while listening
to them take the grant and go off to do real archeology anyway

 Really  You don't know what objective value is  If I offered the people

 sound like a good deal  
 
 That happens to be a subjective example that the people of the
 US would happen to agree on  Continue to move the price up 
 at some point a few people would accept then more then more until 
 probably all would accept at a high enough number
 
 And this high enough number is  
 
 My point is that the deal is bad and pretty much anyone can see it is so

Really  I suspect my neighbor would jump at your deal

Of course she's only three but if it were objectively bad you wouldn't

And my twoyear old says there is a white volvo across the street  But
there isn't  If matter were objective you wouldn't think it would

Ordinarily it is also a value judgement though it needn't be one 
could do science without believing it was worth a damn in any context 
though that hardly seems sensible
No you're just overloading the word value again It is an
estimation of probability of correctness not an estimation of worth
Shit I don't even know what worth means Consider the possibility
that I am not interested in knowing truth I could still believe
that science was the most likely way to get truth and not value
science at all 

But once you make a decision on the value of truth and the likelihood of 
science getting it the rest follows  In your example science is necessarily
worthless and so are its results because truth is worthless assuming that's
all science is good for  And it's no accident that phrases such as good
for fit so naturally in this context

Just because evaluating an arithmetic expression
and asking how much you value life both involve the word value doesn't
mean that they refer to the same thing at all I understand that
the word value is used for both but you have to be clear in what
sense you are using the words I agree with judging science as a
value in the first sense but not the second

But I don't use it in the second sense  Consider that Fma is no 
different than F until I note the connection with reality that Fma has and
F does not  I'm making a decision as to the importance of Fma
over other expressions I can compute  I'm valuing it whether implicitly or
directly because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality
are different to other things which do not  And noone points
out an unimportant difference except to say that it's unimportant
Important useful worthy etc are all words with evaluative
power quite different from evaluating an expression  I'm careful
to use value in the sense I mean which is invariably the first

I don't understand your point here What do you mean by not quitesure
observations It gets observed all the time that if you don't
buy into a whole series of assumptions about how science is
done the results become meaningless 
Well how do you know that it gets observed all the time  This
is your own private subjective it is it not    It is not binding
on the rest of us
Huh What are you talking about People frequently point out the
point I made above That is what I mean by 'observed'

OK I misunderstood  I thought you meant observed in the sense
of 'notquitesureobservations' by which I mean those undertaken
by people

DES does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either
This is just truth by blatant assertion Your in any important sense
seem to be just weasel words Imagine that I have a box which
accepts  bytes and uses the first  to ECB the second 
It still does a perfect job of DESing whether or not any input
is being made at the timewhether or not anyone values mathematics
The concept of a DES box which can be assumed to work as you describe in 
the absence of an assumption of objective reality is incoherent  Such a box 
may as well be assumed to wear a dufflecoat and go to the Limerick Races
Truth by blatant assertion again Frank It's observationally the
case that when you measure it it works It can be reasonably well
assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it barring
quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared
It doesn't take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations

Yes it does  You're saying in effect it works independently of what I
believe and basing that statement on your reasonable assumption ie 
unsupported belief that it works indepently of what you believe It
begs the question rather obviously  And of course reasonable
assumption seems to be weasel words for seems useful useful
belonging to world of ghosts and values and therefore being unreal

As per various threads on science and creationism I've started dabbling into a
book called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland  A question
that I had come from one of his comments  He stated that God is not 
necessarily a religious term but could be used as other scientific terms that
give explanation for events or theories without being a proven scientific 
fact  I think I got his point  I can quote the section if I'm being vague 
The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates  Are there 
explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of
themselves or can everything be quantified measured tested etc

No I don't see what the popularity of a value has to do with whether
it is objective or not Pls explain
If almost all people agree that the sun exists in the usual uncritical sense
and almost all people agree that  a deal is bad  it's a reasonable 
conclusion that the sun really does exist and that the deal really is bad
I disagree completely Until rather recently most people did not
believe in evolution or the possibility of the atom bomb Popular
opinion is notoriously wrong about matters of fact
True but nevertheless the basis of all matters of fact is overwhelming
popular opinion and some overwhelming popular opinion is fact the
sun shines  If it were not so physics would be a personal matter
assumed to be different for each of us  There would be YourGravity and
MyGravity and no theoretical framework to encompass them and predict
both  
This is simply complete nonsense The basis for 'matters of fact' is
if any class of opinion the majority of INFORMED popular opinion
for some value of informed I would really hate to base my knowledge
of for instance QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is

The basis Eric is people peering at the world and saying what
they see  I'm talking about uninterpreted facts  observations  People
do those  Agreement on some observations is a prerequisite for a theory
that is more than personal

about raw observations the dial reads  matter in other words though 
they can surely be mistaken or even lying there too I saw the statue 
move  Getting to theories from raw facts is certainly errorprone but
one assumes that the raw facts are usually as reported otherwise science
is impossible  
Opinions about 'raw facts' as you call them are somewhat different
than interpretations of those raw facts

I know this  You know this  Can we proceed

Now I take an experience of goodevil to be every bit as raw a fact as an
experience of pain or vision
That might seem like a good first pass guess but it turns out to
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things because we all seem to
have rather different opinions experiences about what is good
and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says

You're not comparing apples with apples  If we all look at the same meter
we'll agree  If we're all in the same situation that's when we'll
agree on fundamental values if at all  People who say that nobody agrees on
values to the same extent that they agree on trivial observations seem
to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either

  For me an ethical standard can be nothing
more than a hypothesis about the modification of observed value through
human actions It will be better if  You ought
See above We can't seem to agree on what's better

See above  We sometimes can  There is also the matter of inertia
against experimentation  Most if not all moral hypotheses are necessarily
tested by way of thought experiment  Few people will attempt genocide
or experience a lifetime in jail to find out if it's really as bad as 
all that

   In that context
then I see the choice as being between scepticism relativism and 
objectivism  IMO the existence of supermajority experiences of
good life freedom truth peace love intelligence testifies that
objectivism is true for fundamental values  and this in turn is weak 
evidence that objective ethics may be possible
I don't see that it's any evidence at all
As I point out above I'm really not interested very much in
what the popular opinion is I'm prepared to trustto some extent
the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation
because by and large they accord with my own However if everyone
else said the dial read  and it looked like a  to me I would
hope that I would believe myself Ie believing other people about
these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting
what I would believe if I observed myself but the possibility exists
that it is not Since I know from observation that others disagree
with me about what is good I believe I can discount popular opinion
about 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion
I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get
people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations
is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus actually

Firstly if everyone else said the dial was  and I saw  I'd check
my lens prescription  Secondly your observation that people
disagree shows nothing  people may be looking at different things
by virtue of being in different situations  If I look at an elephant I'll 
see an elephant  That doesn't imply that you will see an elephant if you 
look at an iguana    Thirdly I question your assumption that when
people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals that 
they therefore do not have the same fundamental goals that seems to be the 
disagreement you refer to

 it's this ability to relabel things from immoral to moral

 jon

 From my reading I discovered that this is not yet possible and may not be
 possible in principle  The reason is that every case that comes to trial
 is unique with its own collection of special facts  It is beyond human
 power to specify all the possible circumstances that may bear upon a case
 in advance  We have to judge each one on its own merits and simply take
 the formal law as a guide  The law is an ass we must be careful to use
 it as a beast of burden and not expect anything more from it

Just as well then that I'm not claiming that my own moral system is
absolute

jon

Jon

and I thought to impress with my references

Ok so you don't claim to have an absolute moral system  Do you claim
to have an objective one  I'll assume your answer is yes apologies
if not

Objective means is that different observers will get the same results
The observers may need to be trained in the use of the system  I'd be
interested in seeing a summary of your system though I appreciate that
it might take a great deal of effort to put it in writing

In your post above you objected to situational morals  Perhaps you
could begin by explaining how you objectively set the situational
boundaries of an act in your system  I don't think you can do it
Here's a game we could play that would illustrate my point  I think of
a situation and you have to say whether it is moral or not and why
In your move you can

	 Ask me any objective question about the situation or
	 Pronounce judgement

After you have pronounced judgement I get to add whatever context I like
to the situation provided I don't change anything I have already said
If I can change the context to one where your objective system would give
a different answer then your system is faulty  Since I don't know what
your system is either you must write it down or at least be consistent

Do you think your system could pass this test

What is the fact of evolution  There is a difference between calling
evolution a fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing
facts I happen to think the latter is more accurate 

I hate doing this because it's been done so many times before but

Evolution in the nonscientific sense is change  Although it is
often used in a colloquial manner to refer to phenomena that tend
toward higher complexity and ability evolution simply implies change
for good or for bad  In the scientific sense evolution is merely the
change in allele frequencies for a given population over a period of
time  This is usually what people refer to when they discuss the
scientific fact of evolution  We observe such shifts in allele
frequencies occurring all the time so it is trivial to conclude that
evolution is a scientific fact

The mechanisms that enable such changes in allele frequencies are
collectively known as the theory of evolution  Darwin's natural
selection is one such theory  Genetic drift is another  Gene flow is
still another

Evolution is a fact and a theory  I posted Larry Moran's lengthy
article on this topic a couple days ago  Why don't you go back and
read it

So

Of course he's a paleontologist  He's also an evolutionist  In fact
I'm damn glad he's made it apparent that evolutionary biology has the
ability to adapt to new lines of evidence and to develop new theories
Otherwise it wouldn't be science it would be something like
creationism

So when should we expect your next outofcontext quote John E King
Do creationists like yourself ever use anything other than appeal to
authority to support arguments  Like science maybe  I guess not
And they wonder why they can't teach creationism in science

KS This is the story of Kent the archetype Finn that lives in the 
KS Bay Area and tried to purchase Thomas Paine's Age of Reason This
KS man was driving around to Staceys to Books Inc to Well Cleanlighted
KS Place to Daltons to various other places

KS When he asked for this book the well educated American book store
KS assistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section
KS or then they said that his book has not been published yet but they
KS should receive the book soon In some places the assistants bluntly
KS said that they don't know of such an author or that he is not 
KS a well known living author so they don't keep copies of his books

KS Such is the life and times of America  years after the revolution

Sigh now I don't feel so bad  Searching for a copy in bookstores has
been a habit of mine for at least two years now  I spend a lot of 
time browsing through bookstores new and and used and I've not once
seen a copy  Now I know all I do is pick up a phone and order the
darned thing but come on this is America and he's one of the founding
fathers  And no one carries his books  Sure you can find Common
Sense but I think that's because it's required reading for most
colleges  

I did find one holeinthewall bookstore where the owner said that they 
usually carry one or two copies but that they were currently out I haven't
been back since so I don't know if he was telling the truth or not

What is the fact of evolution  There is a difference between calling evolution a
fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing facts I happen to think
the latter is more accurate   And you said it best yourself If you assess 
the theories of evolution objectively  Why didn't you say  If you assess 
the facts of evolution objectively

The fossil record for example shows us the FACT of evolution  The THEORY of
evolution attempts to explain how the changes shown in the fossil record have
occurred  The theory does not provide the facts they are there already

Theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes Irrational
belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism

deletion

Theism is correlated with fanaticism I have neither said that all fanatism
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism The point is
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic One could of course
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but I just
have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it

IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered

Bogus I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism
The point is that theism is a factor

That's your claim now back it up  I consider your argument as useful
as the following  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism  Therefore
belief is a factor in fanaticism  True and utterly useless  Note this
is any belief not belief in Gods

 
Tiring to say the least I have backed it up read the first statement

I have read it  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point

 
The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy Saying someone believes
something is hardly an information about the person at all Saying someone
is a theist holds much more information Further the correlation between
theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism
because of the special features of theistic belief

Truth by blatant assertion  Evidence
 
 
Gullibility
blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more
reliable indicators  And the really dangerous people  the sources of
fanaticism  are often none of these things  They are cynical manipulators
of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing

That's a claim you have to support Please note that especially in the
field of theism the leaders believe what they say

If you believe that you're incredibly naive

 
You Frank O'Dwyer are living in a dream world I wonder if there is any
base of discussion left after such a statement As a matter of fact I think
you are ignorant of human nature Even when one starts with something one does
not believe one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says
 
To give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement

The onus of proof is on you sunshine  What makes you think that
theist leaders believe what they say  Especially when they say
one thing and do another or say one thing closely followed by its
opposite  The practice is not restricted to theism but it's there
for anyone to see  It's almost an epidemic in this country

Just for instance if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye
of a needle why is the Catholic church such a wealthy landowner  Why
are there churches to the square inch in my country
 
Now some
brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism
I grant you  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned
argument  and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom  Ever read Animal Farm

That's a straw man And as usually in discussions with you one has to
repeat it Read what I have written above not every theism leads to
fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism The point is
there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism

No some of it comes from features which some theism has in common
with some fanaticism    Your last statement simply isn't implied by
what you say before because you're trying to sneak in innate features
of all theism  The word you're groping for is some

 
Bogus again Not all theism as is is fanatic However the rest already
gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and
theism And further the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them
to switch to fanatism easily It takes just a nifty improvement in the
theology

Truth by blatant assertion  
 
 
Gullibility by the way is one of them

No shit Sherlock  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed
to the case you are trying to make

 
Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people
causing the correlation And the whole discussion started that way by the
statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism which you
challenged

Indeed I did  As I recall I asked for evidence  What is the correlation
of which you speak  
 
 
And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
men Interesting that you have nothing better to offer

I said it reads like a warm up to that  That's because it's an irrational
and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice ThemUs
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either
side of church walls

 
Blah blah blah I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights
protects me better from fanatics than the other way round

Of course other people are always fanatics never oneself  Your
wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me
 
It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between
that argument and the rise of fanatism So far it is just another of your
assertions

So  You can do it
 
 
  Define irrational belief  eg is it rational to believe that
     reason is always useful


Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason The latter has
been discussed for a long time with Charley Wingate One point is that
the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information

Well there is a glaring paradox here  an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would
be irrational  Which is it

That's bogus Self reference is not circular And since the evaluation of
usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed

OK it's oval  It's still begging the question however  And though
that certainly is allowed it's not rational  And you claiming to be
rational and all

 
Another of your assertions No proof no evidence just claims

Hey  I learned it from you Did I do good
 
 
At the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we
didn't hear a refutation before so we're back   Deal with it 
you can't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful  Someone
who thinks reason is crap won't buy it you see

 
That is unusually weak even for you The latter implies that my proof
depends on their opinion Somehow who does not accept that there are
triangles won't accept Pythagoras Wow that's an incredible insight
I don't have to prove them wrong in their opinion It is possible to
show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims
unreliable or even absurd statements to be information

Totally circular and totally useless
 
Their wish to believe makes them believe Things are judges by their appeal
and not by their information It makes you feel good when you believe that
may be good for them but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls From
belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt

Truth by blatant assertion  I've seen as many bogus proofs of the 
nonexistence of gods as I have of their existence

 
Rational systems by the way does not mean that every data has to come from
logical analysis the point is that the evaluation of the data does not
contradict logic It easily follows that such a system does not allows to
evaluate if its rational in itself Yes it is possible to evaluate that
it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that
system but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon that has as
little impact as the possibility of a demon ala Descartes

This just doesn't parse sorry
 
So far it just a matter of consistency I use ratiional arguments to show
that my system is consistent or that theirs isn't The evaluation of the

Nor this
predictions does not need rationality It does not contradict however
 
 
Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics
and mathematics are therfore circular

Anybody else think Godel was silly

 
Stream of consciousness typing What is that supposed to mean
 
 
The first part of the second statement contains no information because
you don't say what the beliefs are  If the beliefs are strong theism
andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true  The
second part of your sentence is patently false  counterexample an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it


I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions
of god here

An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here
is a an often refuted fallacy Have a look at the discussion of the
axiom of choice And further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems
out of which they are usually derived I exist is derived if you want
it that way

Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms

what is it you are trying to say

That at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable
for no particular reason at all  Example I am not dreaming

 
Nope There is evidence for it The trick is that the choice of an axiomatic
basis of a system is difficult because the possibilities are interwoven
One therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions
that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway

I'd like to see this alleged evidence
 
One does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method
for usefulness the foundation is laid by how one feels at all that's not
how one feels about it

I see  You have no irrational beliefs  But then fanatics never do do
they

 
Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational

I can't agree with this until you are specific  which theism  To
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
I suspect you do not have


Using the traditonal definition of gods Personal supernatural entities
with objective effects on this world Usually connected to morals andor
the way the world works

IMO any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational  That does
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of
intelligence  Some atheists are also scientists for example

 
They don't use theism when doing science Or it wouldn't be science Please
note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well
They just prohibit formulating them as objective statements

Ergo nothing is objective  Fair enough
 
 
The affinity to fanatism is easily seen It has to be true because I believe
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis However the beliefs say they are
more than a work hypothesis

I don't understand this  Can you formalise your argument

Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice That does not make
B true it is at best a work hypothesis However the content of B is that
it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis Testing or evaluating
evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B already believed
says it is wronG a waste  of time not possible Depending on the further
contents of B AmalekitesIdolatersProtestants are to be killed this can
have interesting effects

Peculiar definition of interesting but sure  Now show that a belief
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak   Why aren't my
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example   Maybe they
don't believe in it  Maybe it's the conjunction of B asserts B and
jailkill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is
entirely irrelevant  It certainly seems so to me but then I have no
axe to grind here

 
The example with your neighbours is a fallacy That your neighbours don't
says little about others And there were times when exactly that happened

Nope it's not a fallacy   It just doesn't go to the correlation you
wish to see
 
And tell me when it is not irrelevant why are such statements about
Amalekites and Idolaters in the Holy Books Please note that one could
edit them out when they are not relevant anymore Because gods don't err
What does that say about that message

Excuse me  THE Holy Books
 
And how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are ok A god
is the easiest way to excuse anything and therefore highly attracting to
fanatics Not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can
have on the rest of the believers Happens again and again and again

A god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything nor the only way

reply to frankDSuucp Frank O'Dwyer
 
The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral
truths and the method by which they can be established  If we accept
that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to
what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved
by any facts about the nature of the world
 
This can be avoided in at least two ways  By leaving the Good
undefined since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is
either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a
reply
 
If the Good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that
they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism

No and begging the question  see below

 By defining the Good solely in terms of evaluative terms
 
Ditto here  An evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the
part of the person making it

Again incorrect and questionbegging  See below

At this point the objectivist may talk of 'selfevident truths'
 
Pretty perceptive that Prof Flew
 
but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that selfevidence is in the
mind of the beholder
 
Of course by denying that subjectobject is true dichotomy
 
Please explain how this helps  I don't see your argument

I don't see yours  It seems to rest on the assertion that everything
is either a subject or an object  There's nothing compelling about that
dichotomy  I might just as well divide the world into subjectobject
event  It even seems more sensible  Causation for example is
an event not a subject or an object  

Furthermore if subjectobject were true dichotomy ie

	Everything is either a subject or an object

Then is that statement a selfevident truth or not  If so then it's 
all in the mind of the beholder according to the relativist and hardly 
compelling  Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved
in its entirety into the subjective category by an idealist or 
solipsist argument and that we have this perfectly good alternate
set of categories subject object event which can be reduced
to subject object quality without any logical difficulty and why
yes I guess I am denying that selfevident truths are all in the mind of 
the beholder

If not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true

All of it

If nothing then NO moral judgements are true  This is a thing that
is commonly referred to as nihilism  It entails that science is of
no value irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful  How
anyone arrives at relativismsubjectivism from this argument beats me
 
This makes no sense either  Flew is arguing that this is where the
objectivist winds up not the subjectivist  Furthermore the nihilists
believed in nothing except science materialism revolution and the
People

I'm referring to ethical nihilism

The subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are
some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself
To hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be
true but to have preferences regarding human activity
 
And if those preferences should include terrorism that moral opinion
is not true  Likewise if the preferences should include noTerrorism
that moral opinion is not true  Why should one choose a set of
preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes
noTerrorism  Oh no reason  This is patently absurd
 
And also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out
to you already by others  Ditch the strawman already and see my reply
to Mike Cobb's root message in the thread Societal Basis for Morality

I've responded over there  BTW  I don't intend this as a strawman but
as something logically entailed by relativism really any ethical system
where values are assumed to be unreal  It's different to say Relativists
say than relativism implies

Apart from the suggestion that appeared in the letters column of
Skeptical Inquirer recently has there been any further mention
about a possible Asimov commemorative stamp  If this idea hasn't
been followed up does anyone know what needs to be done to get
this to happen  I think that its a great idea  Should we start a
petition or something

I'm sure all the religious types would get in a snit due
to Asimov's atheism

Do we have any atheists on stamps now

Nah  I will encourage people to learn about atheism to see how little atheists
have up their sleeves  Whatever I might have suspected is actually quite

Riddle me this  If a gods exist why on earth should we grovel  Why on earth
should we give a damm at all  What evidence do you have that if such a
creatures exist it deserves anything beyond mild admiration or sheer
hatred for what itthey have done in the past whichever gods you care to
pick  That is assuming any records of their actions are correct

Religon offers a bliss bubble of self contained reality which is seperate
from the physical world  Any belief system can leave you in such a state
and so can drugs  Gods are not a requirement  Only if you remove such
useless tappestry can you build a set of morals to build a society upon
It is that or keep on exterminating those who don't believe or converting
them

I suppose for the same reason that you do not believe in all the gods  Why
should any be any different  I use the same arguments to dismiss Koresh
as I do god  Tell me then why do you not believe that Koresh is the son
of god  By logic it is equally possible that Koresh is Jesus reborn

 This is fascinating Atheists argue for abortion

Prove it  I am an atheist  It doesn't mean I am for or against abortion

 defend homosexuality
 as a means of population control 

An obvious effect of homosexuality is nonprocreation  That unlike your
statement is a fact  Please prove that a homosexuality is defended as 
means of population control b being atheist causes you to hold these
beliefs  I defend homosexuality because a what people do with their
bodies is none of my business b I defend the equal rights of
all humans  Do you

 insist that the only values are
 biological 

Define values Prove your statement

 something is contardictory it cannot exist which in
 this case means atheists I suppose

Prove your statement  Electrons are waves  Electrons are particles  I 
believe in both  I have physical proof of both  I have no proof of godtm
only an ancient book  That is not indicative of the existence of a being
with omnipotence or omnipresence  And by your own argument christians
don't exist


 I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war an
 excellent means of controlling population growth or to capital
 punishment I'm sorry but the logic escapes me
 And why just capital punishment what is being questioned here the
 propriety of killing or of punishment What is the basis of the
 ecomplaint
 

First of all your earlier statements have absolutely nothing to do
with your question  Why did you post them  To show that athiests
besides not existing your view are more humane than christiansother
religions


Secondly I am very much for the control of population growth

The logic that you cannot grasp indicates ignorance of contraception
But of course this is 'outlawed' sometimes literally by religion
since if it can't create more followers it will die

rest of rant deleted

This is a standard argument for fundies  Can you spot the falicy The
statement is arguing from the assumption that Jesus actually existed  So far
they have not been able to offer real proof of that 
existance  



	I just thought it necessary to help defend the point that Jesus 
existed  Guys Jesus existed  If he didnt then you have to say that 
Socrates didnt exist cuz he like Jesus has nothing from his hands that 
have survived  Only Plato and others record his existance  Many others 
record Jesus' existance including the Babylonian Talmud  Sorry guys the 
argument that Jesus may not have existed is a dead point now  He did  
Whether he was God or whether there is a God is a completely different 
story however 



Most of them
try it using the very flawed writings of Josh McDowell and others to prove
it but those writers use VERY flawed sources  If they are real sources at
all some are not  When will they ever learn to do real research instead of
believing the drivel sold in the Christian bookstores

The information of that is invariant under your child being a son or
a daughter and singing about Santa Claus Wasn't your argument that
there has to be more
More than what
More than we assume

Which is what exactly

a Most of the people I debate disagree with my premises  Hardly debate
    otherwise
 
Your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged
more than once When I did it you said good question and did not
address it

I've addressed it your caricature is not my favourite point needless
to say at length in a previous outing and am currently discussing it with 
Eric Rescorla  

b There's little point in responding the same points everywhere I do
    my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply
 
You still repeat that point

I do Curious since I believe that was the first time I've ever made it
Not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability
to understand you ask me the same question I'll give you the same
answer especially when in this case I know the answer to be true  I
do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is
making the same points and I'm pushed for time then I try to respond what I 
believe are the strongest formulations of those points  If that doesn't
include your post tough this is USENET and life is tough all over

c Since there's a great deal of responses this isn't always feasible  I
    do my best to honestly answer questions put to me
 
You drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others You appear
with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning
again

I've only debated this issue twice in aa and occasionally in ta  The
first was in response to Simon Clippingdale's positive assertion that
disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals
are relative  It doesn't   Now Simon has dropped out of the debate
for some time I take that to mean that he is either busy or bored
with the topic  I certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty  Do you 

d I can't always understand what you say
 
Neither can't I understand you all the time Usually one asks what the other
side means

Usually one does  Usually you're clear but sometimes you aren't 
and I ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight 
and I feel that I'm debating against line noise  Sometimes I get tired and 
sometimes I have other things I'd rather do  Again this is USENET and
life is tough all over  You're going to have to deal with it

e You're starting to get personally insulting I may not even put your name
    in the hat in future

That's supposed to be a threat

No that's a simple statement and an assertion that I am not answerable
to those who offer me baseless insults  For example those who accuse me 
of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that I don't answer
their questions  

Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there
If only everything would be so easy

What almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there
Because to all intents and purposes it is there
 We had that argument For one your claim that everyone senses it
is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often
And then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it
is there unless evidence against it has been found

I have no problem with the second statement  I have provided an
argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable  the
only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered
by some other people too essentially that people disagree about
fuzzy concepts such as Freedom  It's a good point and I'm thinking
about it
 
Your trick is to say I feel A is not right and so do many I know
therefore A is absolutely right It neglects the possibility that
these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process
restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject
of that process In other words refutes it You make the ontological
claim you have to prove it

Nonsense  My trick is to say  I feel that A is better than B and so 
does almost any disinterested person I ask  Best evidence is therefore 
that A really is better than B subject to the assumption that we
can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B and
that the resulting system of values is selfconsistent

Now get this  really is better is an idealisation a fictional model
in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model It
may or may not correspond to something true  It is nonetheless a useful
assumption  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist 
trick to wit

I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person
I ask  However if even one person disagrees that A is better than B
or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B
then it is the case that B is better than A for that person and nothing
more can be said  

I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority
seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to
maximise B eg a terrorist  To do that would be to claim that 
a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the 
terrorist's  which would of course be true but a nono for an ethical
relativist  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is
simply weasel words and an example of compartmentalisation to rival
anything in the world of religion

For a similar argument I sense morality is subjective it does not
hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by
others

If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively
wrong and it turns out not to be the case for you  of course this
is possible  It is neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence
against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense

It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to
judgements is absolute And as long as you don't provide evidence for
that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to
believe your hypothesis

I've done this freedom with the proviso that I still have to 
answer jon's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no
objective meaning

Further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective
you would have to show that it is independent of humans or the attributes
above look quite misleading

Not really  What evidence is there that anything exists independently
of humans  You'll be hard pressed to find any that isn't logically
equivalent when applied to values

An analogous set of premises would be

Premise   Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest
            route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance
            of the estate and down the Malahide road

Premise   I checked it out and found that the shortest route from my
            which is much closer

You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my
house to a bar yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim
using premises which are logically no different

 
No Morals are a matter of belief so far The people still believe that the
shortest way is through the main entrance No agreement on belief here
And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a
shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it
is the shortest way indeed In other words  your analogy works only when
one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place If not it is
a fallacy

And if this were an argument for objectivism you'd be right  It isn't
though it's a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument
against objectivism nor argument for relativism  Your gimmick is to
assume in the first place that values aren't real and to use this to prove
that values aren't real  In other words you beg the question against me

  Actually I rather like your idea  Perhaps
 the rest of the world should have bombed or maybe missiled Washington
 when the US invaded Nicaragua Grenada Panama Vietnam Mexico Hawaii
 or any number of other places

Wait a minute Doug  I know you are better informed than that  The US 
has never invaded Nicaragua as far as I know  We liberated Grenada 


Liberate is the way an invader describes an invasion including if
I'm not mistaken the Iraqi liberation of Kuwait  Never invaded
Nicaragua  Only with more word games can you say send in the
Marines  

So if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where
we cross someone's border you are right  out of   But normally
invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation
If some nation invades the US Virgin Islands would they be
invading the Virgin Islands or the US  So from this point of
view your score falls to  out of  Mexico Panama

Oh good word games  If you let the aggressor pick the words
there's scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action


 What's a peacenik  Is that somebody who doesn't masturbate
 over Guns'n'Ammo or what  Is it supposed to be bad to be a peacenik

No it's someone who believes in peaceatallcosts  In other words
a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and
Czechoslakia but Poland too if it could have averted the War  And one
who would allow Hitler to wipe all all Jews slavs and political 
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone

That's a convenient technique much seen on altatheism define those
who disagree with you according to a strawman extreme that matches
virtually nobody

Is it supposed to be bad to be a peacenik you ask  Well it depends
on what your values are  If you value life over liberty peace over
freedom then I guess not  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you
than life itself if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live
under a tyrant's heel then yes it's bad to be a peacenik

Very noble and patriotic  I'm sure the fine young Americans who
carpetbombed Iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon
destroyed Iraq's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the
sky or further or who bulldozed other Iraqi infantry into their
trenches or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to were
just thrilled to be risking death if not risking it by much in the
defense of the liberty of  well wealthy Kuwaitis  Can't have
those oilfields under a tyrant's heel if that tyrant is antagonistic
to US interests 

The problem with most peaceniks it they consider those of us who are
not like them to be bad and unconscionable  I would not have any
argument or problem with a peacenik if they held to their ideals and
stayed out of all conflicts or issues especially those dealing with 
the national defense  But no they are not willing to allow us to
legitimately hold a different pointofview  

Having pigeonholed peaceniks in this context people who
disagree with me about the conduct of the Gulf War into
peaceatallcosthitlersupportinggenocideabettingwimps you can
now express righteous indignation when they refuse to fit this mold
and question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms  HOW DARE
THEY

They militate and 
many times resort to violence all in the name of peace  What rank
hypocrisy  

Yes hypocrisy indeed  Those violent peaceniks  Care to list an
example here

All to stop we warmongers who are willing to stand up 
and defend our freedoms against tyrants and who realize that to do
so requires a strong national defense

Wow instant ''s nostalgia  Of course peacenik itself is a
''s Cold War derogatory term equating those who promote pacifism
with Godless Pinko Communists  Yes indeed I felt my freedoms
mightily threatened by Iraq

 Deletia in case anybody hadn't noticed Frank and I are debating
  objective morality and seemingly hitting semantics 

 Secondly  how can I refute your definition  I can only point up its
 logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage
 of the word objective in other areas  Indeed by your definition an
 objective x is an oxymoron for all x  I have no quibble with that
 belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly
 good word

      It may be that being a nonnative Englishspeaker I've
misunderstood your usage of objective and tried to debate something
you don't assert my apologies I'm at a loss to imagine what you really
do mean though

      How many ages can the universe have and still be internally self
consistent I'd be amazed if it was more than one How many different
moral systems can different members of society have  indeed single
individuals in some cases  and humanity still stick together
 
 Begging the question  People can have many opinions about the age
 of the universe and humanity can still stick together   You are
 saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about
 it  Why

      Wrong point The age of the universe has no direct effect on
humanity's sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can
have

      I'm saying the Universe has a real age because I see evidence
for it cosmology astronomy and so on I say this age is independent of
people's opinions of it because I know different people have a lot of
different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem
to give roughly the same results

      The age of the universe like most scientific facts can be
emirically verified through means that'll give the same result no matter
who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the
largish side 
 
 This assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality
 which doesn't depend on what we think

      I can't see how it does that Put a creationist to the task of
performing the tests and calculations see to it she makes no blatant
errors in measuring or calculating and the result of the test will be
the same

 Why should an extreme Biblical
 Creationist give a rat's ass about the means of which you speak

      Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their
opinion If those tests were just my opinion then their own tests
which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we
conducted said tests in identical manner no They don't which I take
as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them

I've heard of no way to verify morality in a
consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to
enlighten me
 
 The same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted
 to work with some accuracy better than a random guess

      Map the activity of nerves and neural activity if you mean
physical pain You have a sharp point I'll give you that but you still
haven't given me a way to quantify morality

 I wrote
 elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value

      We agree Hypotheses however can change I hold that there is no
ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could
gravitate but that they could be changed in any way imaginable
producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes

 If a moral system makes a prediction It will be better if
 that can be tested

      Better and worse are almost always defined in the context
of a moral system Your prediction will always be correct within
that moral system What you need now is an objective definition of
good and bad I wish you luck

      People's ideas about the age of object X are not objective
you can have any idea you like and I can't stop you Universae and
their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you
dislike some detail of them that's a problem with your opinion of
them 
 
 Sure  Assume an objective reality and you get statements like this

      Isn't that what you're doing when assuming an objectively
real morality Besides what exactly is provably wrong with my
statement

I claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such
subjective and individual If I'm wrong then some moreorless
objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality
can you back up this positive claim of existence
 
 Can you back up your positive claim above  No  That's because it's an
 assumption  I make the same assumption about values on the basis
 that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical
 basis of the two is precisely the same

      Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive
claim Besides I think I can lend some credence to my claim ponder
different individuals both fully functional as human beings and members
of society but yet with wildly different moral codes If morality was
objective at least one should be way off base but yet hir
'incorrect' morality seems to function fine How come

      As for producing these individuals it might be easiest to pick
them from different societies say an islamic one and some polynesian
matrilineal system for example if such still exist

 deletia  testing for footballs on desks 

      Now take a look at morality See anything If so please inform me
which way to look and WHY to look that particular way as opposed to
some other Get my drift
 
 No Just look  Are you claiming never to know what good means

      One thing is good under some circumstances because we wish to
achieve some goal for some reason Other times we wish to do something
else and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all

      Some things are hard to make good because we'd seldom if ever
wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into Still
the Aztecs were doing fine until the Spaniards wiped them out

      I almost always know what good means sometimes I even know why
I never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone immutable


      That's a simple matter of proving the track record of the
scientific method
 
 I think it's great and should be applied to values  I may be completely
 wrong but that's what I conclude as a result of quite an amount of
 thought

      Yes me too and I've tried a thing or two down that line it
doesn't look good for objective values to me at all

 In article roaqefidoasdsgicom liveseysolntzewpdsgicom Jon Livesey writes
 
 Noting that a particular society in this case the mainland UK
 has few religously motivated murders and few murders of any
 kind says very little about whether interreligion murders elsewhere
 are religiously motivated
 
 No but it allows one to conclude that there is nothing inherent
 in all religion or for that matter in catholicism and protestantism
 that motivates one to kill

Motivates or allows    The Christian Bible says that one may kill
under certain circumstances   In fact it instructs one to kill under
certain circumstances     

I'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them
to kill under certain circumstances  I do get your distinction between
motivate and allow and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'
atoricities then that's an indictment of that theism  But it rather
depends on what the 'certain circumstances' are  When you talk about
Christianity or Islam then at least your claims can be understood
It's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls
apart  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly
harmless

 For my part I conclude that something
 else is required  I also happen to believe that that something
 else will work no less well without religion  any easy ThemUs will
 do

And what does religion supply if not an easy ThemUs

Not necessarily  Love thy neighbour does not supply a themus  it
demolishes it  And my definition of religion is broader than my
definition of theism as I have explained

 By insisting that even the murder of four labourers chosen because
 they were catholics and who had nothing to do with the IRA by 
 Protestant extremists is not religously motivated I think what 
 you are saying is that you simply will not accept any murder as 
 being religiously motivated
 
 No  What about that guy who cut off someone's head because he believed 
 he was the devil incarnate  That was religously motivated

What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic 
labourers     That wasn't religiously motivated

Not in my opinion  If they were doing it because of some obscure
point of theology then yes  But since all protestants don't do this
nor do they elect extremists to do it for them it's just too broad
too say religion did this  I'm saying that the causes are far more
complex than that  take away the religious element and you'd still
have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism  You
know when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the 
killing' one might listen to that especially when you claim not
to read minds


 Also the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr Rushdie the Inquisitions
 and the many religous wars

What's so special about these exceptions    Isn't this all just a
grabbag of adhoc excuses for not considering some other murders
to be religiously motivated    What's the general principle behind
all this

The general principle is that it's fairly clear to me at least that
religion is the primary motivator enabler whatever of these  It's
not nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at NI apart
from violence of course

 It's not an abstract argument   Northern Irish Protestants say
 We don't want to be absorbed into am officially Catholic country
 
 Now what are we supposed to do   Are we supposed to reply No
 that's only what you think you don't want   Mr O'Dwyer assures us
 that no matter what you say you want you really want something 
 else
 
 You think the Unionists wouldn't mind being absorbed into a nonCatholic 
 country other than the UK of course   It's a terrible thing to lose
 a mind   Maybe the word country is there for more than just kicks
 I certainly don't believe that the Unionists are in it for God  I think
 they wish to maintain their position of privilege

I'm still listening to what they say and you are still telling us 
your version of what they think   You read minds and I don't

You've speculated on my motives often enough and you don't take
my statements of my own beliefs at face value  therefore your claim 
not to read minds has no credibility with me sorry   I also note that 
you fail to answer my question  It just looks to me very much like
you have an axe to grind  especially as you are indeed ignoring what 
most Protestants say  which is stop the killing  The people you
refer to are properly described as Unionists not Protestants

As for their position of privilege what is that if not religion
based

It is based on politics bigotry and heartless extremism  None of these
things are synonymous with religion though there is certainly some
overlap

			RAPTURE  OCTOBER  

		WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE

I STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC

	Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to
panic  But to do so is absolutely useless now  If you had wanted to get right
with God before the rapture you could have but you chose to wait  Now your 
only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the 
Tribulation  But he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be 
saved  Matthew 

II REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION

	The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of
the rapture until Christ's second coming  Also know as the time of Jacob's
Israel's trouble Jere  and Daniel's Seventieth Week Dan  this 
period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror

III GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM

	Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community 
the revived Roman Empire Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will
be tantamount to treason  The Bible however will be your most valuable 
possession during the Tribulation

IV READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated even if you are careful it
is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can
quote them  It is especially important to read Daniel Luke  Matthew  
Revelation and Amos for these books describe the events you can expect to
unfold before you  

V PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you  pray and pray 
and pray  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual 
strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the
sake of Christ  

VI DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST  EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED
ONES DIE AS MARTYRS

	After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community he
will institute a world economic system designed so that you cannot buy sell
or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name  Money will be
useless  And he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and 
slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads and that
no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast 
or the number of his name  Here is wisdom  Let him who has understanding
calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man His number
is   Revelation   
	The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of 
humanity  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed
in the past such as the Holocaust
or maybe the crusades M
You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's
rule it will be much worse than anything in history Matt  I saw
under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and
for the testimony which they held  And a white robe was given to each of 
them and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer 
until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren who would be
killed as they were was completed Revelation  
	His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image
or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn And I saw the souls of 
those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of 
God who had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark
on their foreheads or on the hands  Revelation   He will use every
form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ  Nor
will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you even your children 
torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take
the mark  
	If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image however
you will be consigned to the second death which is the Lake of Fire
Sung about so eloquently by Johnny CashM
You cannot be redeemed  It is better to endure torture for a short while and
gain eternal life then sic to endure eternal torment in the RingHHHH Lake
of Fire  If anyone worships the Beast and his image and receives his 
mark on his forehead or on his hand he himself shall also drink the wine of
the wrath of God which is poured out full strength into the cup of His 
indignation  An sic he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the 
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb Revelation 
 

and probably in the presence of seasonticket holders special hats given to
the first  at the stadium M 

VII SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL

	Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government
until the end of the Tribulation all of the time you gain in hiding is 
important for your spiritual growth and strengthening since only those who are
extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake
	The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or
mountainous area for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least
populated areas  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay 
attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation
As you can see on the weather map heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep
into our area by daybreak  Expect delays on I outbound and perhaps school
closings M 
Store water and food because you will not be able to purchase anything without
the mark  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste
from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood
Get a good water filter M
Bring different types of clothing for all seasons as well as flashlights
batteries generators and First Aid supplies  In short learn how to 
survive and live off the land as the pioneers did

VIII TRUST NO ONE
	
	There will be secret agents everywhere spying for the Antichrist's
government  Be on the lookout
Perot supporters take note M

IX WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST

	It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to
for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will
bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it  We can infer from Daniel 
 certain characteristics of this man  Popular during the first three and a
half years of the Tribulation he will dominate the airwaves  He will be 
physically appealing highly intelligent with Christlike charisma and 
personality  An international politician military tactician and economic
expert his word will be peace he will make a treaty with the Jews which
he will break after three and a half years  He will have such supernatural 
power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed  Even the very elect will
be deceived  If you do not pray and read the Bible you too will be deceived
Dominate the airwaves  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush LimbaughM
	The antichrist will have a companion the False Prohphet sic who
will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak  
All who refuse to worhsip sic the image will be killed  The final three and
a half years will be absolutely insane with demonized spirits everywhere

X DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE

	The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of
Christ  The Antichrist will be defeated  Be steadfast and endure and you 
will be rewarded greatly in Heaven  
	Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now  The salvation of 
your sould depends upon it  Determine that come what may you will not take
the mark or worship the Antichrist  You still have a chance to be saved or
remain saved but this time you will have to be faithful unto death

	May God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return

Imaginative thinking probably isn't the right thing to ask  The thing is
as you no doubt have already been told that Genesis  does not constitute
a scientific theory  Given a scientific theory of the origin of the universe
or earth or anything else we can decide what sort of things we expect to be
true about today's universe  What predictions does Genesis  make about
today's universe that disagree with the standard scientific version

 This is complete nonsense  Relativism means saying that there is no absolut
 standard of morality it does NOT mean saying that all standards of morality
 are equally good
 
 Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others
 How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference

Which goes faster a bullet or a snail  How come you can answer that when
Einstein proved that there isn't an objective frame of reference

Not that Einstein proved anything but you can't answer it and your 
answer be in general true  And even that statement assumes an
objective reality independent of our beliefs about it

 And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
 it isn't an objective reality for values

I'm sorry I can't parse an objective reality for values  Could you try
again

san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face
of disagreement

If you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in
your opinion then all you get is infinite regress  What you do not get
is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
is inferior to that of the man of peace  Your saying it does not
make it so  and that's according to your premise not mine

 Your discusion on the reality of atoms is interesting but it
 would seem that you are verging on the question Is anything real
 that is since observation is not  reliable how can we say
 that anything is real  I don't think this was the intention
 of the original question since you now defineout the word
 real so that nothing can meet its criteria

I've been following this train of talk and the question of dismissing atoms as  
being in some sense not real leaves me uneasy

It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects and therefore the  
underlying thing is not necessarily real  The tree outside my window is in  
this category is observe the light which bounces off of it not the tree  
itself  The observation is indirect but no more so than observations I have  
made of atoms

Also what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done  
with individual atoms  I am thinking in particular of atom trapping  
experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno  
effect where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time

Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying  
either  One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid  
technical background in the field  What I read seemed a little confused a  
quite a red herring

Anyway if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think it  
worked  After doing so I'm willing to try to defend the following assertion  
if anyone cares

Atoms are as real as trees and are real in the ussual everyday sense of the  
word real

find statements that there is no objective length or no objective location

Depends on how you look at it I guess

Speed is a quantifiable measure resulting from a set of methods that

A bullet with zero velocity sitting on a table on a train moving mph
will be moving at a speed of

        a mph to someone on the train
        b mph to someone stationary next to the train

What a coincidence  That's exactly how I've experienced it too
So far
Trouble is I've no way of knowing if it is just coincidence
That is it appears to have been that way in all measurements to date
But I wouldn't go as far as saying that it will always be so  or that it need 
always be so

The reference frame makes the speed relative  But what's interesting
here is that every person on the train will see a stationary bullet
Every person off a bullet moving mph  

More coincidence  Wow
Still  I wish I could be sure that it was always going to be like that

Standard groups sci soc talk must conform to stricter rules when being
established and must show a certain volume of postings or else they will
cease to exist  These groups also reach more sites on USENET than alt
groups  I already posted my opinion to mathew's suggestion which was that
altatheism is on the verge of having too many garbage postings from
fundies and elevating its status to a standard group and consequently
the volume of such postings could make it unreadable

I tend to agree  I came here when it first started and watched it grow
from the roots on talkreligionmisc  It seemed to take a while for enough
atheists to come forward to get past the Let's trash Xians and such
Now there's a stable core and frankly there's a feeling that this is
our group

If we go mainstream we're going to be in a lot more places  And every
fucking fundy loonie freshman will be dumping on us to find Jeesus and
warn us that we're all going to Hell

Want to see what we'll get  Go real altfanbrotherjed and imagine that
those imbecilic tirades will be here  All the time  Every other post

I'm being selfish  I find I really learn a lot here and the SN isn't too
bad  The Browns and the Boobys are a distraction but they are few enough
that they even bring in some of the leavening needed to offset them  But
I greatly fear that mainstreaming would basically put us at the swamping

Is it just me or has this part gotten beyond useful

Gregg is not as I understand his posts giving any support to the bounty
on Rushdie's life  If that's correct end of one point

Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept
His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him
and are even making a little sense to me now  if a person is a member
of a group religion or whatever they bind themselves to follow the ways
of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum
The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West
we have secular governments that maintain more or less a level of control
and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups  I think
the majority of us reading this thread are in tune note  I didn't say
in agreement with the idea that you are finally responsible to the
secular government  and within that to the group or groups a person may
have chosen

With that in mind it not possible under secular law legally as most
people would define the term to hold a person to a particular group once
they decide to separate from it  Only if the secular authorities agree
that there is a requirement of some sort contractual etc is there
any secular enforcement allowed by a group to a group member or past
group member

A religion can and often does believe in and require additional duties
of a group member  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties
in many ways  ostracism is common for example  But the limit comes when
the enforcement would impose unwanted andor unaccepted onus on a person
in conflict with secular law

This is the difference  In a theocracy the requirements of the secular
authorities are by definition congruent with the religious authorities
Outside a theocracy this is not necessarily true  Religious requirements
may coincide or may not  Similiarly religious consequences may or
may not coincide with secular consequences if any

The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie  any actions of
Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of
the ruling The book remains in circulation not by some independant
will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers The fatwa
against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well The
crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being
played out and played up in the the full view of the media

PS I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of shatim also
applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella
of the fasad ruling

If this is grounded firmly in Islam as you claim then you have just
exposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism plain and simple

Whether you like it or not whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or
not there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear
of their life for words

It simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the
worst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs got that
You do not threaten the life of someone for words  when you do you
quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position  If you support
threatening the life of someone for words you are not yet civilized

This is exactly where I and many of the people I know have to depart
from respecting the religions of others  When those beliefs allow and
encourage by interpretation the killing of nonphysical opposition

You or I or anyone are more than privledged to believe that someone
whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover is beyond the pale
of civilized society and you can condemn hisher soul refuse to allow
any members of your association to interact with himher peacably
demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from
the miscreants or whatever short of physical force

But once you physically threaten or support physical threats you get
much closer to your earlier comparison of rape  with YOU as the rapist
who whines She asked for it look how she was dressed

Blaming the victim when you are unable to be civilized doesn't fly

Short reply to Kent Sandvik's post remarking how it is strange that
somehow Sufism is related to Islam as to him they seem quite
different

If one really understands Islam it is not strange that Sufism is
associated with it  In fact Sufism is in general seen as the inner
dimension of Islam

One of the roots of the word Islam is submission  Islam
denotes submission to God  Sufism is the most complete submission to
God imaginable in annihilating oneself in God

I am not a Sufi or on the Sufi path but have read a lot and recently
have been discussing a number of things with others who are on the Sufi
path

Of course the list has to agree with the nickname laws laid down by the
GIPU almost  years ago you know the  of them that were written on
the iron tablets that melted once and had to be reinscribed  Since I am
a prophet of the GIPU I decree that you should post the whole list of

If the first rule of humor is never having to say you're sorry then the 
second rule must be never having to explain yourself  Few things are 
worse that a joke explained  In spite of this and because of requests
for me to post my list o' nicknames I must admit that no such list
exists  It was simply a plot device along with me being the keeper
o' the list to make the obvious play on the last name of Fuller and to
advance the idea that such a list should be made

I assumed that the ol' timers would recognize it for what it is  
Nevertheless how about a list o' nicknames for altatheism posters

Add to this the outrageous cost of putting someone to death special cell
block years of court costs extra guards and the benefits of the death
penalty entirely disappear
 
 That's because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death
 overrides the benefit of all the others  Obviously it's tragic  but
 it is no argument for doing away with the death penalty  If we went
 to war and worried about accidentally killing civilians all of the time
 because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then
 there is no way to win the war
 
 Yes  Fortunately we have rightthinking folks like your good self in power
 and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds of
 thousands of Iraqis in order to liberate oilHHHKuwait  We won the war
 hurrah hurrah

The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and 
exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media  The
facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians 
in any other war of comparable size this century  This was due mostly
to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques
which were technically possible only recently

The idea that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens died is
ludicrous  Not even hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers died
and they were the ones being targeted  Or do you think that the US
and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians
Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets and we know they did
or they were targeting civilian targets  which is hardly condusive to
destroying Iraq's military potential  The military mission planners are
not fools they know they have to hit military targets to win a war
Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you
not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their
tyrantdictator 
 
 OK so some innocent people died  Yes maybe the unarmed civilians fleeing
 along that road didn't need to be bombed to bits  Perhaps that kid with half
 his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled legs weren't
 entirely guilty  But it's worth the death of a few innocents to save the
 oilHHHlives of the Kuwaiti people isn't it  After all the Iraqis may
 not have had a chance to vote for Saddam but they showed their acceptance of
 his regime by not assassinating him right  All that surrendering and
 fleeing along open roads was just a devious ploy  We were entirely within
 our rights to bomb 'em just in case without finding out if they were
 soldiers

How about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in WW
I don't hear you bemoaning them  War is never an exact science but
with smart bombs it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage
of civilian casualties  Sometimes mistakes are made targets are
misidentified innocents die  That's war the way it really is
But the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth
like it's one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is
worse  Like Patrick Henry said some  years ago I know not what
course others may take  but as for me give me liberty or give me
death  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one
wishes to stay free   

 
 The death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime  but the legal
 shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court
 battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what
 it should be  Hence the question is  do we instate the death penalty as
 it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of
 it entirely
 
 Yes let's reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be  All that shit
 about fair trials and a court of appeals just gets in the way of justice 
 Let's give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save
 ourselves the expense of all those lawyers
 
 Think of the knockon benefits too  LA would never have had to spend so
 much money cleaning up after riots and holding showcase trials if the cops
 had been allowed to do their job properly  A quick bullet through the head
 of Rodney King and another for the cameraman and everyone would have been
 saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense
 
 After all if the police decide a man's guilty that ought to be enough  The
 fact that the death penalty has been shown not to have any deterrent effect
 over imprisonment well that's entirely irrelevant
 
 
 mathew
  

Mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase here
You come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although I
feel sure that was not your intent

So the Iraqi war was wrong eh  I'm sure that appeasement would have
worked better than war just like it did in WW eh  I guess we
shouldn't have fought WW either  just think of all those innocent
German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg  How about all the poor 
French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent  We 
should have just let Hitler take over Europe and you'd be speaking
German instead of English right now

Tyrants like Hussein have to be stopped  His kind don't understand
diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun  My only regret is
that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad so
now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice not to
mention the  Americans who died was for naught  Liberating Kuwait 
was a good thing but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better

And as for poor poor Rodney King  Did you ever stop and think why
the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty
Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those
policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape
But the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and I
have not seen  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a
trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply
lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a stateofmind
which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends
to support in the case against the policemen  

Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused
whether they be criminals or cops  One is not found guilty if there is
a reasonable doubt of one's guilt and only the jury is in a position
to assess the evidence and render a verdict  Anyone else is simply
succumbing to verbal vigilantism

Hmm  What about Jesus

Sure a person could have great respect for Jesus and yet be an 
atheist  Having great respect for Jesus does not necessarily mean 
that one has to follow the Christian or Muslim interpretation of 
his life

I replied to this query via email but I think there are some
issues that are worth discussing in public

MTA mtabbottunixamherstedu wrote
 I am doing research on atheism part of which involves field research here
 on the net  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this
 group intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief

I would recommend you to take a look at

 your dictionary
 altatheism FAQ files

to notice that atheism is not a belief system and what is common
to all atheists is not a belief but a lack of belief in deities
I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without
paying careful attention to this issue 

 First of all I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a
 variety of ways with varying amounts of detail it's possible to give 
 succinct answers to most everything but there's enough here to keep most of 
 you typing for hours I'm sure

IMHO this is a poor method to do any real survey although I'm sure the
replies might keep you amused for hours

 Also I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system
 although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs
  but
 are skeptical towards everything  I understand but you know what I mean
 Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases 
 required to get the precise idea across  

No I do not know what you mean If you are surveying our individual
philosophies fine but that's not strictly atheism Atheism is not
just another godless version of the theistic explanations for life
the universe and everything It is not a belief system and it could
hardly be called a philosophical system

Once more Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities 
Do not twist the meaning or assume that we have some kind of
philosophy we all agree on

Some comments on your questions

 What contact with other atheists have you had before and after and during
 your conversion to atheism  Certainly your involvement with altatheism
 counts  how have net discussions affected your beliefs  

I would also like to hear more about this Have we been able to 'convert'
anyone

 Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational
 means proofs of the nonexistence of God etc or was it perhaps at least 
 in part through other means alienation from mainstream religion etc  

This question contains a contradiction in terms Beliefs 
cannot be acquired rationally  if they could they would not be 
beliefs You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become
atheists  those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily
become atheists they just think very little about religion It seems
it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that
religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities

Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question
quite odd  how can lack of belief be acquired When did I acquire
lack of belief in the Easter Bunny I did believe in Santa though 

 To what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your 
 beliefs What phenomena of the universe and of human existence anything
 from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human
 affairs do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs and where
 are they lacking as an explanatory method  

This question does not make any sense since atheism does not deal with
these issues  it is not a worldview or a philosophy or a belief system

Sigh why haven't I seen a good wellthought survey in the Usenet
for three years and what is the point of doing surveys in the net
anyway Just to abstract some opinions

 I've seen this claim about the Josephus insert flying around the

 the forger would have to put his insert into all of them


Not necessarily It is much the same problem as the Eve hypothesis If
all or most of the copies that were available when printing became
common were decended from the same copy a change in that copy would
propagate to all modern copies even if there were other copies in 
existence at the time of the change Very few libraries would have
duplicates of a nonreligious book so there would be few opportunities
for anyone to notice that there were variations Even if someone did
notice they would be more likely to copy the variation that conformed
to their expectations and ignore the others

Theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes Irrational
belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism
 
deletion
 
Theism is correlated with fanaticism I have neither said that all fanatism
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism The point is
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic One could of course
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but I just
have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it

IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered
 
Bogus I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism
The point is that theism is a factor

That's your claim now back it up  I consider your argument as useful
as the following  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism  Therefore
belief is a factor in fanaticism  True and utterly useless  Note this
is any belief not belief in Gods

Gullibility
blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more
reliable indicators  And the really dangerous people  the sources of
fanaticism  are often none of these things  They are cynical manipulators
of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing
 
That's a claim you have to support Please note that especially in the
field of theism the leaders believe what they say

If you believe that you're incredibly naive

Now some
brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism
I grant you  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned
argument  and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom  Ever read Animal Farm

That's a straw man And as usually in discussions with you one has to
repeat it Read what I have written above not every theism leads to
fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism The point is
there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism

No some of it comes from features which some theism has in common
with some fanaticism    Your last statement simply isn't implied by
what you say before because you're trying to sneak in innate features
of all theism  The word you're groping for is some

Gullibility by the way is one of them

No shit Sherlock  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed
to the case you are trying to make

And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
men Interesting that you have nothing better to offer

I said it reads like a warm up to that  That's because it's an irrational
and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice ThemUs 
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either
side of church walls

  Define irrational belief  eg is it rational to believe that
     reason is always useful


Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason The latter has
been discussed for a long time with Charley Wingate One point is that
the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information

Well there is a glaring paradox here  an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would
be irrational  Which is it

That's bogus Self reference is not circular And since the evaluation of
usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed

OK it's oval  It's still begging the question however  And though
that certainly is allowed it's not rational  And you claiming to be
rational and all

At the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we
didn't hear a refutation before so we're back   Deal with it 
you can't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful  Someone
who thinks reason is crap won't buy it you see

Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics
and mathematics are therfore circular

Anybody else think Godel was silly

The first part of the second statement contains no information because
you don't say what the beliefs are  If the beliefs are strong theism
andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true  The
second part of your sentence is patently false  counterexample an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it

 
I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions
of god here
 
An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here
is a an often refuted fallacy Have a look at the discussion of the
axiom of choice And further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems
out of which they are usually derived I exist is derived if you want
it that way

Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms
 
what is it you are trying to say

That at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable 
for no particular reason at all  Example I am not dreaming

Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational

I can't agree with this until you are specific  which theism  To
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
I suspect you do not have

 
Using the traditonal definition of gods Personal supernatural entities
with objective effects on this world Usually connected to morals andor
the way the world works

IMO any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational  That does
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of
intelligence  Some atheists are also scientists for example

The affinity to fanatism is easily seen It has to be true because I believe
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis However the beliefs say they are
more than a work hypothesis

I don't understand this  Can you formalise your argument
 
Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice That does not make
B true it is at best a work hypothesis However the content of B is that
it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis Testing or evaluating
evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B already believed
says it is wronG a waste  of time not possible Depending on the further
contents of B AmalekitesIdolatersProtestants are to be killed this can
have interesting effects

Peculiar definition of interesting but sure  Now show that a belief
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak   Why aren't my 
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example   Maybe they 
don't believe in it  Maybe it's the conjunction of B asserts B and
jailkill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is
entirely irrelevant  It certainly seems so to me but then I have no
axe to grind here

I love god just as much as she loves me If she wants to seduce me
she'll know what to do 


But if HeShe did you would probably consider it rape  

 Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you will see
 that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic
 Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  Yet some think it is
 the ultimate  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
 know more than you do now 

Your argument is of the type you'll know once you try
Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried and believed
for many years but were eventually honest enough to admit that 
they had lived in a virtual reality


Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe So  

 To learn you must accept that which you don't know

What does this mean To learn you must accept that you don't know 
something righto But to learn you must accept something I don't
know why This is not the way I prefer to learn It is unwise to
merely swallow everything you read Suppose I write a book telling
how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn tm has helped me in my
daily problems would you accept this since you can't know whether
it is true or not


No one asks you to swallow everything in fact Jesus warns against it   But let
me ask you a question  Do you beleive what you learn in history class or for
that matter anything in school  I mean it's just what other people have told
you and you don't want to swallow what others say right  

The life  death and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact  As much
as anything else you learn  How do you choose what to believe and what not to
I could argue that George Washington is a myth  He never lived because I don't
have any proof except what I am told   However all the major events of the life
of Jesus Christ were fortold hundreds of years before him  Neat trick uh

There is no way to get into a sceptical heart  You can not say you have given a 
sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have  You must TRUST not just go 
to church and participate in it's activities  Were you ever willing to die for what
you believed

Here's a suggestion for the logical argument FAQ  I don't think it's covered
though the fallacy probably has a better name than the one I used  How about
it mathew

INCONSISTENCY AND COUNTEREXAMPLE

This occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes
stand A which is inconsistent with B  There are two variations in which B is
either a mutuallyagreedon premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same
source  The second party fallaciously responds by saying see the source
really does say B it's right here this reply does not refute the allegation
of inconsistency because it does not show that the source only says B

Example of the first type The Koran says unbelievers should be treated in
these ways  We can both agree these are immoral  The Koran clearly says in
this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way

Example of the second type There are two Biblical creation stories  You're
wrong since the Bible clearly describes the creation as description

On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me  Leftover Turkey
On the second day after Christmas my truelove served to me  Turkey Casserole
    that she made from Leftover Turkey
days  deleted   Flaming Turkey Wings 
    Pizza Hut commercial and MtluAgic bait

 I don't have to make outrageous claims about religion's affecting and
 effecting history for the purpsoe of aa all I have to do point out
 that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate
 atheism 

Bill you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its
sole purpose the validation of atheism  It doesn't  This board is
used to discuss atheism as a philosophy to share posters' experiences
regarding atheism to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole to
share resources relating to atheism and even to socialize with others
with similar views  And of course with the number of theists who come
here to preach it is also used to argue the case for atheism 


           At no time have I made any statement that religion was the
 sole cause of anything what I have done is point out that those who
 do make that kind of claim are mistaken usually deliberately 

If you want to accuse people of lying please do so directly  The
phrase deliberately mistaken is rather oxymoronic

 
 To credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to
 misunderstand human nature the function of religion and of course
 history I believe that those who distort history in this way know
 exaclty what they're doing and do it only for affect

The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are
Christianity and Islam  Both of these claim to make their followers
into good people and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been
accomplished through their faiths  IMHO they are right  The American
Friends Service Committee Quaker Catholic Relief Services Bread
For The World Salvation Army soup kitchens and Mother Theresa spring
to mind  Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names
of some analagous Islamic groups  

When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her
Christianity I believe her  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity
such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care
for those in need  The point is that such a philosophy does have the
power to change the behavior of individuals  if it is widespread
enough it can change societies

The same works for the horrors of history  To claim that Christianity
had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the
awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute  What it seems you
are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never
the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that
religion has had no evil impacts on history  That is absurd

If morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that What right do
 we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality
 Pardon the extremism but couldn't I murder your brother and say that I was 
 exercising my rights as I saw them was doing what felt good didn't want
 anyone forcing their morality on me or I don't follow your morality 

  You most certainly could But you could also expect the same would happen
right back to you Every person claiming that thier decisions are not
questionable leads to chaos It is the pure fear of this chaos that
makes humans come up with a code to follow

Indeed  But that code is law not morality  I think the point here was not 
a discussion of anarchy vs law  I think that most see the benefit of a non
anarchistic system  Our incredibly high standard of living is based on 
technology derived from an ordered existance  We wouln't have got far if 
we were still bashing each other over the head with clubs right

The question becomes is it possible to have an ordered society in which 
the laws are recognized to be in place based on enlightened self interest 
as opposed to morality 

And secondly assuming a satisfactory legal code is in place and we 
choose to persue individual freedoms as far as possible is a moral 
code required or even acceptable

Can an agreement ever be reached  At what point do we start to comprimise

Think about these questions in light of some recent social issues

 I read an article about a poll done of students at the Ivy League
 schools in which it was reported that a third of the students
 indentified themselves as atheists  This is a lot higher than among the
 general population  I wonder what the reasons for this discrepancy are
 Is it because they are more intelligent  Younger  Is this the wave of
 the future

I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which
ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus  In the real world
tm it's easier for theists well people in general really to lock
themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those
people who are of the same opinion as they are  In college you are
constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have
different ideas about life the universe and everything  It is much much
harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from
reaching you

So in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to
atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in
their beliefs over four years  There is nowhere to run

 The point of my post was that Rushdie was not being condemned solely
 for the words in his book although this was certainly a contributing
 factor It was the whole series of actions of Rushdie and his
 publishers following the publication of the book and the initial media
 spotlight placed on the book that in large part led to the fatwa The
 kind of fatwa levelled against Rushdie is not lightly placed and there
 are any number of antiIslamic writers both within and outside the
 Islamic world who have not had fatwas made against them Here someone
 who adds fuel to an explosive situation might be charged with incitement
 to riot  if people die in the rioting the charges against him might
 become even more serious
 
 How can Rushdie be blamed for the deaths of people who are demonstrating
 against him  The deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with
 the demonstrations or on the demonstrators themselves if they were
 violent  To what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour
 against Rushdie

Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media the Muslim voice on
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes
showing
the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations For every twenty or so
newspaper magazine articles interviews etc supporting Rushdie there
would
appear one Muslim voice This person was usually selected based on how
dramatic and incoherent he was not on his knowledge of Islam or the
situation at the time This approx twenty to one ratio continued
throughout the escalation of the crisis with Rushdie in the central
spotlight as the man of the moment the valiant defender of everyman's
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility As an aside it's
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up
some books defaming certain ethnic and religious groups continued
to be banned here It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these

groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of 
hate towards these groups For Muslims this kind of double standard 
was annoying

Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at
organized
Islam and he did so with admirable verbal skill The only kind of Islam
which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular Islam  an Islam
separated from it's Qur'an it's Prophet God its legislation and most
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena Fine  Rushdie
made
his views known  the Muslim's made their anger at his book known The
scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions  it was by this
time
already a political situation  affecting governments as well as
individuals
The situation was a serious one with farreaching political implications
At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie throwing fuel on the fire 
engaged
in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution

Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as

this has no responsibility has no reason to exercise restraint of any
kind has no
obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till
matters calm down Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in boldly
defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary
work no matter what insult they find within it Perhaps you see him as
a kind of secular heroic Knightmounted on the his media steed
 doing battle with the dragon of Islamic fundamentalism

Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who 
grew up in a Muslim atmosphere knew well what Muslim's hold dear 
who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions
to slander insult and attack Islam and its most notable personalities 
who when
faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis continued with
his mischief in the world stage of the media  who even after people were
injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation
continued his mischief instead of having the good sense to desist
Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale mischief
making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged The deaths
of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief
even after this was the triggering factor that seemed to
decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief The person at the
centre of all these events was Rushdie  he was the source of the
continuing mischief  all media support government support was
just that  support The source was Rushdie and his publishers who
were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy
to see Rushdie constantly in the media The Islamic rulings that
deal with people who engage in this kind of grandscale mischief
making was applied to Rushdie

You're attempts at justification are not doing the
 image of Islam any good

I have made no attempts at justification only at explanation Image is
the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie
If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a subculture
within a larger secular culture such that the secular principles and laws
had precedence over the laws of Islam  then I have no doubt that Islam
would then be thought to have a good image Principally because it would
by and large reflect the secular image A good image usually means  be
more
like me

Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude
that
resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis

  In Iran the situation was monitored for many
 months  when Rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free
 worldwide voice that the media gave him the situation was monitored
 more seriously When even after many deaths occured worldwide Rushdie
 still did not desist  the fatwa was pronounced When behaving like
 a total jerk endangers lives and the jerk sees this and still insists
 on his right to behave like a total jerk  he has the rug jerked out
 from under him
 
 If the muslims didn't make such a big fuss over the book like issuing
 death threats and killing publishers NO ONE WOULD HAVE HEARD OF IT

The fatwa came later  much later If Rushdie didn't mouth off so much in
the
media the fuss would have died down  no one would have been killed no
fatwa would have been passed  the whole episode would have fizzled away

Yes The Qur'an discusses this point in several ways some of
them quite directly For example it says that if God were
to appear them there would be no need for faith and belief as
the evidence would be definitive

Ah Excellent So why doesn't she appear to me I'm a little weak in the
blind faith department Besides she doesn't even really need to appear
how about oh say a little tip  something like put your all on  in the
 at the Dog Races  perhaps in a dream or vision

How do we know that
Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something 

Would a person who was high write so well and with such consistency

I'm afraid I don't know arabic I have only read translations I wouldn't
know it if it were wellwritten Consistent though is one thing the Quran
is not  And have you read it in arabic  Besides some of my best
writing has been done under the influence of shall we say consciousness
altering substances

And how
do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up or
put in their own little verses 

They'd have to be very good to do so without destroying the beauty
and literary quality of text Arabic text 

Yes so How do we know they weren't very good Again assuming that the
Quran is beautfully written

And why can Muhammed marry more than four women 
when no other muslim is allowed to 

Muhammad did not exceed the number after the revelation regulating
the number of wives a man could marry but before it

Ok I retract this point Although I might still say that once he knew he
should have done something about it

Although I think the biggest
insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to
suppress a book sight unseen on the sayso of some holy guy Not to
mention murder the author

I agree But is it really true that this is the case

I haven't interviewed all muslims about this I would really like it if this
were false But I can't take it on your sayso  what are your sources

Another case of judging principles on the basis of those who claim
to follow them

What other basis do we have to judge a system Especially when we can't get
a consistent picture of what Islam really is Do I believe Khomeini Do I
go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey Or
perhaps you say I should go only by the Quran Ok whose translation And
what about things like And wherever you find idolators kill them

I don't think you're right about Germany  My daughter was born there and
I don't think she has any German rights eg to vote or live there beyond the
rights of all EC citizens  She is a British citizen by virtue of
her parentage but that's not full citizenship  For example I don't think
her children could be British by virtue of her in the same way
 
 I am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an
 application for it It might require immigration to Germany but
 I am almost certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable
 in this case

Nope Germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws  The 
ethnic Germans who have lived in Russia for over  years 
automatically become citizens if they move to Germany but the
Turks who are now in their third generation in Germany can't
It's not a very good example to show citizenship without descent

I assume that you  say here a religious law is for the followers of the
religion That begs the question why the religion has the right to define
who is a follower even when the offenders disagree

No I say religious law applies to those who are categorized as
belonging to the religion when event being judged applies This
prevents situations in which someone is a member of a religion
who when charged claims that heshe was not a member of the
religion so they are free to go on as if nothing had happened

A brutal system filtered through leniency is not lenient


Huh


How do you rate public floggings or floggings at all Chopping off the
hands heads or other body  parts What about stoning


I don't have a problem with floggings particularly when the offenders
have been given a chance to change their behavior before floggings are
given I do have a problem with maiming in general by whatever means
In my opinion noone who has not maimed another should be maimed In
the case of rape the victim is maimed physically and emotionally
so I wouldn't have a problem with maiming rapists Obviously I wouldn't
have a problem with maiming murderers either


May I ask if you had the same opinion before you became a Muslim



Sure Yes I did You see I don't think that rape and murder should
be dealt with lightly You being so interested in leniency for
leniency's sake apparently think that people should simply be
told the did a bad thing


And what about the simple chance of misjudgements

Misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible
I suspect that it's pretty unlikely that given my requirement
of repeated offenses that misjudgments are very likely

 
Orient is not a place having a single character Your ignorance
exposes itself nicely here


Read carefully I have not said all the Orient shows primitive machism


Well then why not use more specific words than Orient Probably
because in your mind there is no need to it's all the same


Because it contains sufficient information While more detail is possible
it is not necessary


And Europe shows civilized bullshit This is bullshit Time to put out
or shut up You've substantiated nothing and are blabbering on like
Islamists who talk about the West as the Great Satan You're both
guilty of stupidities


I just love to compare such lines to the common plea of your fellow believers
not to call each others names In this case to substantiate it The Quran
allows that one beATs one's wife into submission 


Really Care to give chapter and verse We could discuss it


Primitive Machism refers to
that I have misspelt that before my fault
 

Again not all of the Orient follows the Qur'an So you'll have to do
better than that


Sorry you haven't put out enough

 
Islam expresses extramarital sex Extramarital sex is a subset of sex It is
suppressedin Islam That marial sexis  allowed or encouraged in Islam as
it is in many branches of Christianity too misses the point

Read the part about the urge for sex again Religions that run around telling
people how to have sex are not my piece of cake for two reasons Suppressing
a strong urge needs  strong measures and it is not their business anyway

Believe what you wish I thought you were trying to make an argument
All I am reading are opinions
 
It is an argument That you doubt the validity of the premises does not change
it If you want to criticize it do so Time for you to put up or shut up



This is an argument for why you don't like religions that suppress
sex A such it's an irrelevant argument

If you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then 
fine My response is then you have given no reason for your statement
that sex is not the business of religion one of your arguments

The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong
measures are required to suppress it If the urge to have sex is so
strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to
find a marriage partner

 What about the Twelve Imams who he considered incapable of error
 or sin Khomeini supports this view of the Twelve Imans This is
 heresy for the very reasons I gave above 


I would be happy to discuss the  issue of the  Imams with you although
my preference would be to move the discussion to another
newsgroup  I feel a philosophy or religion group would be more 
appropriate 


I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how
deviant the view as I've articulated it above which may not be
the true view of Khomeini is from the basic principles of Islam 
So that the nonmuslim readers of this group will see how far from 
the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them And 
if they are not in contradiction with the basics of Islam how 
subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while 
they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an


The topic is deeply embedded in the world view of Islam and the
esoteric teachings of the Prophet SA Heresy does not enter
into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric
religion that is only nominally if at all concerned with the metaphysical
substance of man's being and nature


In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance
or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human
being is a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam 


From your posts you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought You
should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable 
Shi'ite authors as well  at least that much respect is due before the
charge of heresy is levelled


Absolutely I would be interested in discussing this privately and
I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of
errorfree and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with
the teachings of the Qur'an However prima facie such attemptsa
are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery explicitly
proscribed by the Qur'an

 His conclusion was that
while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to
say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the
Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in
the Traditions  How would a man of th Century Arabia have known
what not to include in the Holy Qur'an assuming he had authored
it  

Well it looks like the folks in socreligionislam have loosened up
a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the bankinginterest
topic  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition
to the one you mentioned  These may be hard to find but I think I may
take a stab at it out of curiosity  I know the one film I saw on this
subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were
used to show science in the Koran which I posted here were also pretty 
vague  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the
quotes they have

At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings
about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science

I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians
Creation Science on any topic  It would be interesting to find a history
of scientific interpretations of the Koran to see if anyone used the Koran
to support earlier science which has since been discarded  It is all too
easy to look at science as it exists today and then interpret passages
to match those findings  People do similar things with the sayings of
Nostradamus all the time

Anyway it is a rather unique claim of Islam and may be worth checking

 Which type of morality are you talking about  In a natural sense it
 is not at all immoral to harm another species as long as it doesn't
 adversely affect your own I guess
Hehehe so you say but this objective morality somehere tells you 
that this is not the case and you don't know all the rules of such
transcendental game systems

Which objective system are you talking about  What is its goal
Again which brand of morality are you talking about

 PS I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of shatim also
 applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella
 of the fasad ruling
 
 Please define the words shatim and fasad before you use them again

My apologies Shatim I believe refers to slandering or spreading
slander and lies about the Prophetsas  any of the Prophets

Basically any prophet I've ever dealt with has either been busy 
hawking stolen merchandise or selling swampland house lots in 
Florida  Then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets
and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it

It's a kind of willful caulmny and cursing that's indicated by the
word This is the best explanation I can come up with off the top
of my head  I'll try and look up a more technical definition when I
have the time

Never mind that but let me tell you about this Chevelle I bought 
from this dude you guessed it a prophet named Mohammed  I've
got the car for like two days when the tranny kicks then Manny 
my mechanic tells me it was loaded with sawdust  Take a guess
whether Mohammed was anywhere to be found  I don't think so


Fasad is a little more difficult to describe Again this is not
a technical definition  I'll try and get that later Literally

Oh Mohammed

the word fasad means mischief But it's a mischief on the order of
magnitude indicated by the word corruption It's when someone who
is doing something wrong to begin with seeks to escalate the hurt

Yeah you Mohammed

disorder concern harm etc the mischief initially caused by their 
actions The wrong is specifically related to attacks against
God and His Messenger and mischief corruption disorder etc

You slimy mass of pond scum

resulting from that The attack need not be a physical attack and there
are different levels of penalty proscribed depending on the extent
of the mischief and whether the person or persons sought to 
make hay of the situation The severest punishment is death

Yeah right  You're the one should be watching your butt  You and
your buddy Allah  The stereo he sold me croaked after two days
Your ass is grass

Jim

Yeah that's right Jim

They spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the Constitution 
I realise that this is widely held belief in America but in fact
the clause on cruel and unusual punishments like a lot of the
rest was lifted from the English Bill of Rights of 

Just because the wording is elsewhere does not mean they didn't spend
much time on the wording

We have already looked in the dictionary to define the word  Isn't 
this sufficient
Since the dictionary said that a lack of mercy or an intent to
inflict injury or grief counted as cruel sure

People can be described as cruel in this way but punishments cannot

My theory though yet unproven is that this is due to simple envy

no its not

its due to the fact that there are two issues here Religion and religion

religion is personal belief system
Religion is a memetic virus

people loudly proclaiming their beliefs are crossing the border from
religion  Religion  people that want to save others are firmly
entrenched in Religion memoids

rule  of not practicing Religion is to shut the fuck up unless
you discuss it politely  this means that the motive behind the conversation
is not only your selfgratifying wish to spread the word  

religion is something that ultimately comes from within a person and
reflects their value judgements  Religion is something that is
contracted from others and does not reflect the persons value judgements
other than perhaps i think i'll be brainwashed today

Religion is a drug

i believe you can discuss religion  however the post that started this
off was not intented as discussion it was more a proclamation of
someones Religion

if you think i'm talking about censorship or that i'm closeminded you haven't
understood this  i don't have any problem with the discussion of 
religion its just Religion that i can't stand

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively and science is a procedure
science cannot be valued nonsubjectively

You're just overloading the word value AGAIN I suspect

Maybe you're underloading it   If from hundreds of alleged procedures for
obtaining truth about the material world I pick science then that is a 
subjective judgement according to the strict meaning of the terms yes

Yes naturally

Ordinarily it is also a value judgement though it needn't be one 
could do science without believing it was worth a damn in any context 
though that hardly seems sensible

No you're just overloading the word value again It is an
estimation of probability of correctness not an estimation of worth
Shit I don't even know what worth means Consider the possibility
that I am not interested in knowing truth I could still believe
that science was the most likely way to get truth and not value
science at all 

But you STILL value likely ways over unlikely ways correct If I wanted to
know the truth about say the specific gravity of chicken soup I could 
employ science  meters gauges scales etc  or I could just talk a walk 
on a beach somewhere Both have a possibility of generating the truthful 
answer  in the case of the walk on the beach it would have to be some sort 
of sudden inspiration about the specific gravity of chicken soup which just 
happened to be truthful  so what makes me choose the scientific method of 
truthdetermination over the walk on the beach method Because I VALUE 
science's higher probability of obtaining truth that's why Everywhere one 
turns there is intentionality and value judgments lurking just beneath the 
veneer of detached objectivity It is an inescapable aspect of the human 
condition

Like I said before DES works whether I value my privacy or
not

OK which DES  The abstract function DES that stops working in any 
important sense if noone cares for the importance of truth mathematics 
meaning information etc  A DES chip or DES sw  That stops working in 
any important sense if noone values science objective reality etc   
DES does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either

This is just truth by blatant assertion Your in any important sense
seem to be just weasel words Imagine that I have a box which
accepts  bytes and uses the first  to ECB the second 
It still does a perfect job of DESing whether or not any input
is being made at the timewhether or not anyone values mathematics

The concept of a DES box which can be assumed to work as you describe in 
the absence of an assumption of objective reality is incoherent  Such a box 
may as well be assumed to wear a dufflecoat and go to the Limerick Races

Truth by blatant assertion again Frank It's observationally the
case that when you measure it it works It can be reasonably well
assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it barring
quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared
It doesn't take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations

Well I would add that the attribute works even when not being measured is 
ALSO something which is valued and intended Eric All you've succeeded in 
doing is kicking this up another level in the hierarchy of values

  If one follows relativism to the letter then the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective' 'correct' or anything else
Twaddle You're overloading the meaning of the word value
that's all Whether I care if the results are true is a value
I fail to see how whether they are true correct whatever is
a value

The result's actual truth is independent of what you think of it if you
care to look at it that way  however your perception of a result's
truth cannot match its actual truth unless you care to follow the a
procedure to obtain truth science correctly  You have to pick 
the right procedure and note its importance  You've got to value it
Otherwise you don't care about actual truth and shouldn't object
to the statement objectivism is true

Nonsequitur Humans do math because they value what math can do
That does not mean that math is based on values  unless you claim
that computers or even unconstructed physical systems which instantiate
mathematical systems also are based on values 

The point is that when we recognize these instantiations of mathematical
systems we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even 
to control these instantiations There is always a driving purpose behind
thought  a motive if you will Sometimes that motive is relatively 
pure eg pursuit of knowledge othertimes it's impure eg pursuit
of money or of physical pleasure But it's always there And even when it
is a pure pursuit of knowledge presumably one pursues knowledge in order
to personally grow develop advance to a higher plane of being So there
is still an element of acquisition of reaching of grasping even in the
approach of the detached objective scientist 

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively and science is a procedure
science cannot be valued nonsubjectively   If we're picking facts
and hypotheses subjectively then we are using a maybenotquitesure
method on maybenotquitesure observations  That should lead
to maybenotquitesure results no  The fact that it does not seem
to might make one question the premise which is that our subjective
valuations are necessarily unreliable

OK which DES  The abstract function DES that stops working in any 
important sense if noone cares for the importance of truth mathematics 
meaning information etc  A DES chip or DES sw  That stops working in any 
important sense if noone values science objective reality etc   DES
does not work in a value vacuum  Nothing else does either

The DES chip works just fine even if I don't know that it exists
You are confusing why we are using the chip with the chip works
They aren't the same

No I think you are the one who is rather confused There are two senses
in which we can say that the phenomenon of the working of the DES chip is 
valuebased

	 Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES
	   chip and started it running in the first place

		and

	 Because the very notiondefinitionconcept of works has value
	   associated with it

The first is a CAUSAL linkage  we want it to work therefore we CAUSE it to 
work That is rather a mundane interpretation The second however is a more 
subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage  that the attribute works is 
itself as everything else presented to the human consciousness as a valued 
fact not just a factinitself You are perhaps justified in shooting down 
the causal linkage but you have not begun to address the phenomenological 
linkage

Suns in unpopulated solar systems shine without being blessed by your
values 

Our predictions or confirmations that suns shine in unpopulated solar systems
are however items of value

Genetic algorithms closely related to the scientific method
can work without intervention of any kind 

Again our predictions or confirmations of the working of genetic algorithms
are items of value

Your claim is without merit
the universe does not depend on human values any more than it
revolves around earth

The universe does not DEPEND on human values no but our experience and
understanding and concepts of the universe are laced with human values
Phenomenologically everything is valuerelated since the thing which is 
experiencing the phenomena ie self is itself valuedriven Self is in 
fact the very SOURCE of all values Whatever involves self involves values

Anyway since I seem to be the only one following this particular line
of discussion I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have
read this book  What are your thoughts on it  

I read it when it first came out
And I liked it 
At the time I still sortakinda thought of myself as a muslim and I
couldn't see what the flap was all about 

Thank you  I now know at least that though I may be on drugs at
least I'm not the only one

The writing style was a little hard to get used to but
it was well worth the effort Coming from a similar background Rushdie
grew up in Bombay in a muslim family and moved to England I grew up in
New Delhi it made a strong impression on me  And he used many of the
strange constructions of Indian English the yaar at the end of a
sentence Butbutbut the occasional hindi phrase etc

Yes this took some getting used to  of course not having an Indian
connection no knowledge of hindi etc this was not trivial for me
I did have thanks to the wonders of the net A Glossary to Satanic
Verses posted to recartsbooks by Vijay Raghavan which explains a
lot of the Indian English constructions Indian culture references
even the Islamic references Jahilia Submission the context of
the Satanic Verses incident etc  what I have only covers the
first couple of hundred pages but it helped me get into the flow of
the novel I can mail this to anyone interested if anyone has
portions after part I if they exist I'd like to get those

    real or alleged experts  Critical reasoning evidence and if possible
    experimentation are necessary  Creationists frequently display a massive
    confusion about this by merely quoting both nonexperts and experts alike
    some of the latter quotes are in fact false and steadfastly refusing to
    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure  This strongly suggests
    that a their claims completely lack any scientific merit and b they
    are aware of this fatal deficiency  Of course you may not actually be a
    creationist and this may not be your real intent

     You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his
    statement  Why is that  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the
    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology
    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context
    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate
    scientists  Of course you may not actually be a creationist and this may
    not be your real intent

     Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of
    evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one
    line quote from an unidentified nobody  It is also important to note that
    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate
    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck
    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid  Creationists seem rather fond
    of diving head first into this logical fallacy  Of course you may not
    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent

     Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science an attack
    on evolution either the fact or the theory really represents an attack on
    science  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve B the
    fact of evolution will not ever go away  Creationists lost the battle long
    ago more than  years in fact but are simply too willfully ignorant and
    irrational to acknowledge the fact  Of course you may not actually be a
    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant


Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub kvIASTATEEDU asks

  Neither I nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings  Who is he 

  I like Hitchings am not to be found in Webster's B  Francis Hitchings
is a scientifically illiterate creationist or perhaps he is just playing the
part of one who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution The Neck of
the Giraffe  In that publication he quotes a creationist Jean Sloat Morton
using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could
not have formed by chance  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution
the two are quite independent but also concluding with a non sequitur ie
the conclusion does not follow pp   Hitchings also misquotes Richard
Lewontin in an effort to support creationism pp 

  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber
in the Los Angeles Times and repeated in the Oregonian  The article was
titled Giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far  Excerpts include 

  Francis Hitchings is not a biologist  He goes after Darwin like Mark
  Antony after Brutus  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and
  pseudoscience with the sinuosity of a snakeoil salesman  He suggests
  a mystical organizing principle' of life using the similarity of organs
  in different creatures as evidence sic

  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not
against it  If John E King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't
surprise me much  It's also interesting that King had nothing to add ie
he only posted a quote

Wait  Are we talking about ethics or morals here
Is the distinction important
Yes

Well make it

Ethics deal with individuals  Morals deal with groups

Well our moral system seems to mimic the natural one in a number of ways
Please describe these number of ways in detail  Then explain the any
contradictions that may arise

Just look at how human behavior mimics animal behavior  I couldn't even
begin to list all of the similarities  Many of the dissimilarities are due
to our high intelligence

Please describe these number of ways in detail  Then explain any
contradictions that may arise

I don't know  What is wrong  Is it possible for humans to survive for
a long time in the wild  Yes it's possible but it is difficult  Humans
are a social animal and that is a cause of our success
Define difficult

I don't understand what you don't understand

The sentence Yes it's possible but it is difficult  Humans survived
in the wild for hundreds of thousands of years

No  As noted earlier lack of mating such as abstinence or homosexuality
isn't really destructive to the system  It is a worst neutral
So if every member of the species was homosexual this wouldn't be destructive
to the survival of the species

Most animals that exhibit homosexuality are actually bisexual

Answer the question Keith  Is homosexuality detrimental to the survival
of the species

I write
 Imagine that  Alterian dollars turn up in your bank account every
 month Suppose further that this money is being paid to you by a your 
 bighearted Alterian benefactor or b a bug in an Alterian ATM  Let's
 suppose that this is a true dichotomy so PaPb Trouble is Alterius 
 is in a different universe so that no observations of Alterius are possible
 except for the banks  you couldn't possibly afford it 
 
 Now let's examine the case for a  There is no evidence whatsoever that
 there is any such thing as a bighearted Alterian benefactor However
 Pexistsbh A b  Pnotexistsbh A b   On the grounds that 
 lackofevidencefor is evidenceagainst when we have a partition like
 that we dismiss hypothesis a

 Turning therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that
 hypothesis  On the same grounds as before we dismiss hypothesis b

 The problem with this is that we have dismissed all of the possible
 hypotheses and even though we know by construction that the money 
 arrives every month we have proven that it can't because we
 have dismissed all of its potential causes

 That's an extremely poor argument and here's why

 Premise  this money is being paid to you by either a your big
             hearted Alterian benefactor or b a bug in an Alterian ATM
 
 Thus each monthly appearance of the bucks should it happen is an
 observation on Alterius and by construction is evidence for the
 existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the ATM
 
 Premise  no observations on Alterius are possible

      except for the banks  you couldn't possibly afford it 

 You forgot to include this  My premise is actually

 Premise   The cardinality of the set of possible observations on Alterius
             is one

 This is clearly contradictory to the first

 Not if you state it properly

 Trouble is on the basis of premise  you say that there can be no evidence
 of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise leads to the
 conclusion that the appearance of the bucks should it happen is evidence
 for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug
 
 Voila a screaming contradiction

with my highlights  SC
 But in a strawman argument There is only evidence for OneOfBenefactorBug
 No observation to distinguish Benefactor from Bug is possible That is
 
 not evidence for Bug and neither is it evidence for Benefactor Nor
 
 is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as
 if there were no BenefactorBug two statements both would be false

This is still contradictory It reduces to

   Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug

   this is not evidence for benefactor neither is it evidence for
       bug meaning that it doesn't lend more weight to one than to the
       other

   therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence
       can exist for bug

But  relies on a shift in meaning from  When you say paraphrased
in  that this is not evidence for benefactor for example what you
mean is that it's no more evidence for benefactor than it is for bug

Yes that's what I mean

In  however you've shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor
so that it now means absolute' evidence for benefactor rather than
relative' evidence for benefactor wrt bug

Not really I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other  I
think this is just a communications problem   What I am trying to say
in my clumsy way is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates
to theism making predictions prayer your 'Rapture' example I don't
buy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A

In my example one couldn't dismiss
benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity  one of these is necessary
to explain the dosh  I brought up the 'onebyone dismissal' process to
show that it would be wrong to do so  From what you're saying in this
post it seems you agree and we're talking at crosspurposes

 is still in contradiction to 

Some sums may help With B  benefactor b  bug d  dosh arrives in account

   implies  PBb  d  

Assuming that PBb  d   so it's either the benefactor or a bug
which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then

   PBb  d      PB  d  Pb  d

so

   PB  d  Pb  d    

but  implies that

   PB  d      and  Pb  d    

No this isn't what I meant  PB  d   and Pb  d   with
necessarily no new observation we've already seen the dosh to change
those estimates  I was trying to say again in my clumsy way that
it would be wrong to assign  probability to either of these  And that's
precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods  gods are
one class of hypothesis there are many others belonging to a set of
hypotheses oneofwhich is necessary to explain something which otherwise 
would not be satisfactorily explained  It can be thrown out or
retained on grounds of nonrational preference not of science or statistics   
Alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grounds
that the answer can't be known or that the notional probability estimates
are effectively useless being equal agnosticismweak atheism

 As they do when the set M is filled by the universe is caused by x
 where x is gods pink unicorns nothing etc   and no observation
 tends to one conclusion over the other

Exactly the point I was making I think So we don't throw out any of
these contrary to your assertion above that we do

Some people do Simon and they think they are doing excellent science
My sole point was that they aren't

 Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis Hi ie x
 where Px  Hi   can cause PHi to go to zero after a finite
 number of observations Only in this case do we get to throw any of the
 hypotheses out

 Exactly my point though I may have been unclear

You said the diametric opposite which I guess is the source of my confusion

I was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so

 What I'm trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of
 evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this does not hold true for
 all or perhaps any versions of theism  and it isn't true that those for
 which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor

On the contrary those for which it does not hold are exactly those which
can be discarded using the Razor See my post on the other branch of this
thread

Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of  If
the razor holds for gods then it holds for all like hypotheses  Which
means that you're assigning Px  Hi  for all i though we've already
established that it's not correct to do so when SUMPxHi over
all i

 Simply put anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or
 nonexistence of gods whether inductive or no is at best mistaken and
 at worst barking mad

Luckily I make no such claim and have specifically said as much on numerous
occasions You wouldn't be constructing a strawman here would you Frank
Although that doesn't of course rule out my being barking mad in any case
I could be barking mad in my spare time with apologies to Cleese et al

But I think you miss the point once again When I say that something is
evidence against an hypothesis that doesn't imply that observation of
the said something necessarily falsifies the hypothesis reducing the
estimate of PH  data to zero If it reduces this quantity it's still
evidence against H

No I got that  I'm talking about the case when A  You're clearly
correct when A   And I'm not constructing a strawman though it's
certainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying  However
by any standards a system that says when A gods are highly unlikely
and when A gods can be dismissed using the Razor is a system purporting
to be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist or are unnecessary
to explain any or all phenomena  In my experience systems such as this
including those which purport to prove that gods exist always contain
a fallacy upon close examination  If that's not what you're saying then
please put me straight

 Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has
further to
travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon
of   
infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

Don't think so  It would become a singularity in a few miliseconds

Apart from the suggestion that appeared in the letters column of
Skeptical Inquirer recently has there been any further mention
about a possible Asimov commemorative stamp  If this idea hasn't
been followed up does anyone know what needs to be done to get
this to happen  I think that its a great idea  Should we start a
petition or something

I believe that there's a  year period from time of death until
a person can be on a commemorative stamp  It was broken once
for Lyndon Johnson I think but other than that it has held for
awhile  Of course we can still start now  the Elvis stamp
was petitioned for ages and things really moved once it got
past the  year anniversary of his death

Here's another quote from the same source as your quote above

Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to mean the same thing  But
they don't  Evolution of life over a very long period of time is a
fact if we are to believe evidence gathered during the last two
centuries from geology paleontology molecular biology and many other
scientific disciplines  Despite the many believers in Divine creation
who dispute this  the probability that evolution has occurred
approaches certainty in scientific terms  Hitching The Neck of
the Giraffe

Of course  Hitchings believes in evolution  The purpose of the quote I
sited was to show the ambivalance that evolutionists have with their own
theory  For example on page  he states one may question an 
evolution theory so beset by doubts among even those who teach it  If
Darwinism is truely the great unifying principle of biology it encompasses
extraordinarily large areas of ignorance  It fails to explain some of the
basic questions of all  how lifeless chemicals came alive what rules of
grammer lie behind the genetic code how genes shap and form living things

Ordinarily it is also a value judgement though it needn't be one 
could do science without believing it was worth a damn in any context 
though that hardly seems sensible
No you're just overloading the word value again It is an
estimation of probability of correctness not an estimation of worth
Shit I don't even know what worth means Consider the possibility
that I am not interested in knowing truth I could still believe
that science was the most likely way to get truth and not value
science at all 
But once you make a decision on the value of truth and the likelihood of 
science getting it the rest follows
SO
What's your point

In your example science is necessarily
worthless
MAYBE TO ME In this example and as I argue below that's not even
true

and so are its results
Not necessarily

because truth is worthless assuming that's
all science is good for
But science is also good for technology which may or may not
have anything to do with truth I may value technology and
not truth after all

And it's no accident that phrases such as good
for fit so naturally in this context
Spare me This is nonsense Frank Pregnancy is sometimes referred
to as having a bun in the oven Does this mean that the uterus
is at  F Argument by idiom is weak indeed and it's what
you're engaging in here

Just because evaluating an arithmetic expression
and asking how much you value life both involve the word value doesn't
mean that they refer to the same thing at all I understand that
the word value is used for both but you have to be clear in what
sense you are using the words I agree with judging science as a
value in the first sense but not the second
But I don't use it in the second sense  Consider that Fma is no 
different than F until I note the connection with reality that Fma has and
F does not
Of course it's different ma What is at issue is accuracy
not difference

I'm making a decision as to the importance of Fma
over other expressions I can compute
This is the result of a chain of deduction about the value
of understanding the universe One can make the observation
that IF one wanted to understand the universe Fma would be
valuable without believing Fma to be valuable Frank

I'm valuing it whether implicitly or
directly because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality
are different to other things which do not
Things which have a basis in reality are different from things
which have a basis in reality Quantum mechanics is very different
from biochemistry yet they both allegedly have basises in reality
Look Frank noone said that people didn't do science because they
value itin the sense of think it is good but that is not necessary
to make the observation that it's results have value in the sense
that they are accurate Allow me to give you an example I think
that knowing the byte order on IBM s is pretty much worthless
I don't care to know it but I would be quite prepared to
note as valuable ie accurate the claim that it was Bigendian
if it was shown to be so like by showing me the manual

 And noone points
out an unimportant difference except to say that it's unimportant
Important useful worthy etc are all words with evaluative
power quite different from evaluating an expression  I'm careful
to use value in the sense I mean which is invariably the first
No it's fleeking not Scientific judgement is SOLELY the sense
of evaluating an expression accuracy It has nothing to do with
importance worthiness or usefulness Choice of problems DOES
have to do with those factors but they are orthogonal to
evaluating for accuracy solutions to chosen problems

The concept of a DES box which can be assumed to work as you describe in 
the absence of an assumption of objective reality is incoherent  Such a box 
may as well be assumed to wear a dufflecoat and go to the Limerick Races
Truth by blatant assertion again Frank It's observationally the
case that when you measure it it works It can be reasonably well
assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it barring
quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared
It doesn't take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations
Yes it does  You're saying in effect it works independently of what I
believe and basing that statement on your reasonable assumption ie 
unsupported belief that it works indepently of what you believe
No I was saying that it works independently of whether I measure
it which is something quite different

 It
begs the question rather obviously
It would if they were the same thing which they are not

  And of course reasonable
assumption seems to be weasel words for seems useful useful
belonging to world of ghosts and values and therefore being unreal  
Frank you are attempting to inject goodness judgements where there
are only accuracy judgements by essentially punning on the word
'value' which has both meanings useful is a goodness judgement
Reasonable is an accuracy judgement They are not the same
thing at all Useful in making some conclusion is an accuracy
judgement again I'm afraid Sorry Frank but all you're doing is
using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue IF you
mean to say that science is based on value accuracy judgements
I have no problem with that If you mean to say that it's based
on value goodness judgements that's nonsense By contrast
morality is clearly based on goodness judgements

 This is the story of Kent the archetype Finn that lives in the 
 Bay Area and tried to purchase Thomas Paine's Age of Reason This
 man was driving around to Staceys to Books Inc to Well Cleanlighted
 Place to Daltons to various other places
 
 When he asked for this book the well educated American book store
 assistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section
 or then they said that his book has not been published yet but they
 should receive the book soon In some places the assistants bluntly
 said that they don't know of such an author or that he is not 
 a well known living author so they don't keep copies of his books
 
 Such is the life and times of America  years after the revolution

On a similar note a good friend of mine worked as a clerk in a
chain bookstore  Several of his peers were amazing one woman in
particular

A customer asked her if they had The Autobiography of Benjamin
Franklin  Who's it by was her first question  Then Is he
still alive  Then Is it fiction or nonfiction 

Finally my friend intervened and showed the guy where it was
 
It makes one wonder what the standards of employment are

Could you let us know when this happened so I can see if my version
is as uptodate as possible  I try to resave the FAQs once in a

generally notice such a change

And I like to stay current

Summary A PROB W OMNIPOTENCE
Keywords GODJESUS
XNewsReader VMS NEWS 

I recall a discussion I had heard years ago It went something like this 
The problem with omnipotence at least as I perceive it as personified by 
the christian God ideal is that it is potentially contradictory  If a 
manifestation such as God is truly infinite in power can God place limits 
upon itself


Some stuff I can't recall
Then some other questions I think I recall correctly
Can God unmake itself
Can God make itself assuming it doesn't yet exist
Has God has always existed or is it necessary for an observer to bind all of
Gods potential quantum states into reality
Was God nothing more than a primordial force of nature that existed during
the earliest stages of universal inflationary creation
Is God a vacuum fluctuation
Given a great enough energy density could we recreate God
Would that make US God and God something else


Some more stuff I don't recall concerning creating God  Followed by
Is God selfaware
Is it necessary that God be selfaware
Is God a living entity
Is it necessay that God be a living entity
Is God unchanging or does it evolve


Any comments Post them so that others might benefit from the open inquiry
and resulting discussion

Kyle

 they had been preaching against as interference with God's will Being

Kent Sandvik and Jon Livesey made essentially the same response so this
time Kent's article gets the reply

I agree but this started at one particular point in time and we 
don't know when this starting point of 'accurately copied scriptures'
actually happened 

This begs the question of whether it ever started perhaps because
accuracy was always an intention

Even worse if the events in NT were not written by eye witness accounts a
high probability looking at possible dates when the first Gospels were
ready then we have to take into account all the problems with information
forwarded with the 'telephone metaphor' indeed

It makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away
reporters if you will  As I said earlier the telephone metaphor is
innately bad because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the
aims of writing these sorts of texts  Also I would point out that by the
standards generally asserted in this group the distinction between
eyewitnesses and others is hollow since nobody can be shown to be an
eyewitness or indeed even shown to be the author of the text

There is no evidence that the original texts of either the OT or the NT
are largely lost over time in a sea of errors corrections additions and
deletions  In the case of the NT the evidence is strongly in the other
direction the Textus R and the NestleAland text do not differ on more
than a low level of significance  It is reasonable to assume a similar
situation for the OT based on the NT as a model

No you're just overloading the word value again It is an
estimation of probability of correctness not an estimation of worth
Shit I don't even know what worth means Consider the possibility
that I am not interested in knowing truth I could still believe
that science was the most likely way to get truth and not value
science at all 

But you STILL value likely ways over unlikely ways correct
For the times when I'm interested in the truth I do

If I wanted to
know the truth about say the specific gravity of chicken soup I could 
employ science  meters gauges scales etc  or I could just talk a walk 
on a beach somewhere Both have a possibility of generating the truthful 
answer  in the case of the walk on the beach it would have to be some sort 
of sudden inspiration about the specific gravity of chicken soup which just 
happened to be truthful  so what makes me choose the scientific method of 
truthdetermination over the walk on the beach method Because I VALUE 
science's higher probability of obtaining truth that's why Everywhere one 
turns there is intentionality and value judgments lurking just beneath the 
veneer of detached objectivity It is an inescapable aspect of the human 
condition
This strikes me as rather obvious What is your point about this
Kevin
Truth by blatant assertion again Frank It's observationally the
case that when you measure it it works It can be reasonably well
assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it barring
quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared
It doesn't take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations
Well I would add that the attribute works even when not being measured is 
ALSO something which is valued and intended Eric All you've succeeded in 
doing is kicking this up another level in the hierarchy of values
Huh Of course I intend that it works But the fact that I want it
to work and want to use a procedure that will show that it works
has no bearing on the logical standing of the procedure that
I choose empiricism

I don't see how this is any kind of problem Kevin

Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you will see
that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic
 
        If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
know more than you do now          

I once heard an arguement from a xtian friend similar to this
Christianity is a Higher Logic  Athiest like u will not be able
to understand it  Your atheist logic is very low  Only thru faith can 
we understand the Higher Logic in God

So I asked him So what is this Higher Logic

His answer I don't know

This  the posting above highlights one of the worst things about
xtainity  It is abundantly clear to both atheists  xtains that
their believe is both illogical  irrational  Their tactics therefore
to disregard logic  rationality altogether  Silly excuses such as
the ones above and those such as How can u trust science science
was invented by man only goes to further show the weakness of
their religion

In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing xtains
never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses
They know it would be a fruitless act given the irrational nature
of their faith
They would wait until a person is in distress then they would comfort
himher and addict them to their emotional opium

Never in my life had I met a person who converted to xtainity coz it's
reasonable  Rationality has no place in xtainity see xtian arguement
against reason above

By the way that's why I consider you a theist

 points consisting of rhetorical fallacy unsupported claims and
demonstrable falsehoods deleted

 
No wonder that we don't see any detail for this claim It is good to
remember that you have answered the statement that you are a theist
by another correspondent with that you are not a member of a denomination
It is either stupidity or an attempt at a trick answer Not unlike the
rest of your arguments
 
 
Mr Roseneau I have little patience with people who tell me what I
believe and who call me a liar when I disagree  I'm in a position
not only to know what it is that I believe but to say so  I am an
agnostic

 
I am extremely wary of the way you use words Like in this case there
are broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by
themselves and others theists I have pointed to that in my post You
use one of them
 
Your use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption because my
moral is objectiveabsolute or the other buzz words you are so fond
of everybody will know it and there is no need to define it more
exactly
 
And as a user has shown recently the easiest way to dispell you is
to ask you for definitions
 
 
You are of course free to speculate on my motives for objecting
to seeming irrational bigotry if you wish but the flaws which I
point out in your arguments stand on their own merits
 
Since you are the only one seeing them and many correspondents
point to the flaws in your reasoning respectively discussing I
can't say I am impressed

 Wasn't JC a carpenter  Anyway that's beside the point I think the fact
 that is more compelling is JC fulfilling the prophecies when the prophecies
 include him getting killed in the most agonizing possible way
 
 This is nonsense
 
 I can think of a lot more agonizing ways to get killed  Fatal cancer for
 instance
 
 Anyone else have some more  Maybe we can make a list

Actually I find the stuff about JC being a carpenter more
interesting  Is there an independent source for this assertion
or is it all from the Christian Bible  Is there any record at
all of anything he built  A table a house some stairs Norm
Abrams says the real test of a carpenter's skill is building
stairs with hand tools  Did he leave any plans behind for say
kitchen counters and cabinets  Did he build his own cross
If so did he use pressuretreated lumber  Gotta use that
pressuretreated anywhere that wood meets concrete but it
holds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications  I keep
seeing these bumperstickers that say My boss is a Jewish
Carpenter but they're always on the back of Ford Escorts
and a real carpenter's apprentice would probably drive a
pickup so I'm out for verification that he really was a
carpenter

 Lucky for them that the baby didn't have any obvious deformities  I could
 just see it now Mary gets pregnant out of wedlock so to save face she and
 Joseph say that it was God that got her pregnant and then the baby turns
 out to be deformed or even worse stillborn  They'd have a lot of
 explaining to do 

A few points guys oops guy and gal but I use the term guy asexually

 Has the same sort of conspiracy ever occurred since I mean there must
have been dozen of times in the past two thousand years when it would have
been opportune time for a 'messiah' to be born

 
It has There is a guy running around in Switzerland who claims to have
been conceived similarly His mother says the same His father is said to
be a bit surprised
 
But anyway there have been a lot of Messiahs and many have had a similar
story about their birth Or their death A list of Messiahs could be quite
interesting
 
 
 Wouldn't you feel bad if you turned out to be wrong and the conception of
Christ was via God  I can just imagine your faces as Mary asks you if
you've ever had a child yourself

 
I would wonder why an omnipotent god pulls such stunts instead of providing
evidence for everyone to check And the whole question is absurd
 
Wouldn't you feel bad if you'd find out that stones are sentient and that
you have stepped on them all your life And wouldn't you feel bad when you'd
see the proof that Jesus was just a plot of Satan
 
 
 If they wanted to save image they could have done what Joseph planned to
do in the first place  have a quite wedding and an equally quite divorce
I think it was quite easy to do under Jewish law  In that regard they
would have been pretty DUMB to think up a conspiracy like the one you've
outlined in that they a bringing attention on themselves  Messiah
appearances were like Royal Scandals in zero AD Israel see the part in
Acts when the Sandhedrin are discussing what to do about the growth of the
new Church ie one wise guy said  leave it alone and if it is what it
says it is nothing can stop it and if it isn't then it will just fizzle out
anyway

 
You've forgotten the pride factor
 
 
 It didn't fizzle the Church I mean

 
The argument is a fallacy It is like thanks for reading this far on the end
of a letter Most religions claim that they won't fizzle because they contain
some eternal truth So does Christianity Since there are old religions it is
no wonder to find old religions that have it that they would last
 
Roll twelve dice Calculate the chance for the result Argue that there must
be something special about the result because an event with a chance of
 could hardly happen by chance only Feel elevated because you have
participated in letting that special event take place

Specifically I'd like to know what relativism concludes when two
people grotesquely disagree  Is it

a Both are right

b One of them is wrong and sometimes though perhaps rarely we have a 
    pretty good idea who it is

c One of them is wrong but we never have any information as to who so
    we make our best guess if we really must make a decision

d The idea of a right moral judgement is meaningless implying that
     whether peace is better than war eg is a meaningless question
     and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer

e Something else  A short positive assertion would be nice

e d is close but misses the point that there is a third party
with their own subjective viewpoint asked to make a decision  Peace
is not better than war unless we view the situation subjectively as
humans  Of course we are humans and so do view situations from
our own perspective so it is meaningful for us to discuss questions
of war and peace

What I want is a response 
giving me the pros and cons of Metaphorical religious language Could an 
atheist accept this view without giving up the foundamentals of what he 
believes in  

Could an atheist accept a usage in which religious literature or
tradition is viewed in a metaphorical way  Of course this is
essentially what we do with Homer or with other concepts such as
fate luck free will   However there remains the question of
whether the religious literature of  say  Christianity is a
particularly good set of metaphors for the world today  It's also
entirely unclear and to me quite unlikely that one could take a
contemporary religion like that and divorce the metaphoric potential
from the literalism and absolutism it carries now in many cases

 Pardon me   I am trying to apply human terms to nonhumans
 
 That's right  You are basically stating that morality can only deal with
 humans because only humans are sentient enough to be moral that is
 you say that morality can only deal with intentions

I have never said that only humans are the only beings which are
sufficiently sentient to have intentions   In fact I have explicitly
said that I am perfectly happy to consider that some animals are
capable of forming intentions

What I am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive
behaviour to have moral significance since it seems to me 
such behaviour does not involve intention

 
 I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative 
 this does not prevent his behavior from being moral
 I'm sure you do think this if you say so   How about trying to
 convince me
 
 I think that a moral act is moral whether or not the implementor 
 thinks it is

That's not the point   The point is whether the implementor thinks
at all    The issue is not whether thinking produces opinion A
or opinion B but whether thinking takes place period

 
 I've offered four times I think to accept your definition if
 you allow me to ascribe moral significence to the orbital motion
 of the planets
 
 Hmm perhaps you can ascribe it  I could say that many human actions
 are not natural and thus don't follow a natural morality

Since humans are part of nature are not all human actions natural

Or perhaps you're going to throw in a definition of natural that
will allow us to describe some actions as natural and some as 
not natural   If so what is the definition


 Other than those death which surround mating rituals other animals 
 just don't kill each other within a species that often do they  

Sure they do as multiple posters have show you   Sharks for example
eat wounded sharks   I've personally seen cats eat their newborn

Are you in some kind of denial   People give you example after example
and you go off the air for a week and then pop up claiming that it 
never happened    It's very strange

 But why don't animals kill each other

See what I mean   Here we go again   What do we have to do write
up a tailormade FAQ just for Mr Schneider

God is the One Who created the night the day the sun and the moon
Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion Qur'an 

Deletion
Well that is certainly different but it looks as if there is a translation
found for everything By the way I am most surprised to hear that night and
day move in an orbit

I thought about this too  some translations refer to only the latter
two objects being in orbit but Bucaille's translation seems to indicate
the night and the day travelling in orbit too  Perhaps this can be
understood when one looks at it from the earth's reference frame  from
this reference frame the day and the night would appear to orbit the
earth travelling from east to west  This is from the reference frame
when the earth is still

 
Well yes but that belongs in the other group there is a interpretation
found for everything However allowing any form of interpretation reduces
the information of the text so interprteted to zero
 
By the way I have checked the quote and I think the lines preceding those
quoted above are more interesting
 
    where mountains are set on earth in order to immobilize the earth
    where the skies heavens are referred to as well supported
 
the lines given above are   after my edition
 
 
Maybe this is what is meant by the above  It's just a possibility

And that the sun travels in an orbit without saying that earth does too
sounds geocentric to me

I will see if I can find out more about this

But it is still not geocentric

 
That sun and moon move and the earth is immobile sounds geocentric to me

 But this just shows then that painful execution is not considered 
 cruel and unusual punishment This shows that cruel as used in the 
 constitution does NOT refer to whether or not the punishment causes physical 
 pain
 Rather it must be a different meaning
 
 I don't think so  Although some forms of execution are painful the electric
 chair looks particularly so I think the pain is relatively shortlived
 Drawing and quartering on the other hand looks very painful and the
 victim wouldn't die right away he'd bleed to death I'd imagine

So what do we have now an integral over pain X time

I get to lash you with a wet noodle for ever but I only get to
cut you up with a power saw if I'm quick about it

 about realtivism is that it elevates the heinous to the level of the good 
 by saying in effect to each his own or what's good for you  isn't good
 for me  Thus the terrorist is elevated to the same level as the man
 of peace

So then I assume that you feel that there is an objective definition for

 That happens to be a subjective example that the people of the
 US would happen to agree on  Continue to move the price up 
 at some point a few people would accept then more then more until 
 probably all would accept at a high enough number
 
 And this high enough number is  
 
 My point is that the deal is bad and pretty much anyone can see it is so

remained sceptical  Amongst his novels the following are of some relevance

Galactic PotHealer
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans  When the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers pothealer Joe Fernwright is
unable to comply  A polished ironic and amusing novel

A Maze of Death
Noteworthy for its description of a technologybased religion

VALIS
The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic
Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters

The Divine Invasion
God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system  Unfortunately she is terminally ill and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to hour easy listening music

MARGARET ATWOOD

The Handmaid's Tale
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously
assassinated and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
right again  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new Christian theocracy  Women's right to own property is revoked
and their bank accounts are closed sinful luxuries are outlawed and the
radio is only used for readings from the Bible  Crimes are punished
retroactively doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are
hunted down and hanged  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on

This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized  However it
is probably worth reading if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is
about  It exists in many different versions so make sure you get the one

RICHARD SWINBURNE

The Existence of God Revised Edition Clarendon Paperbacks Oxford
This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with The Coherence of
Theism  and was concluded with Faith and Reason   In this
work Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of God  His arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late th century western Christian values and
aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were
decisively rejected in Mackie's The Miracle of Theism  In the revised
edition of The Existence of God Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie

J L MACKIE

The Miracle of Theism Oxford
This posthumous volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of God  It ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of Descartes Anselm Berkeley Hume et al through
the moral arguments of Newman Kant and Sidgwick to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne  It also addresses those
positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational
such as those of Kierkegaard Kung and Philips as well as replacements for
God such as Lelie's axiarchism  The book is a delight to read  less
formalistic and better written than Martin's works and refreshingly direct
when compared with the handwaving of Swinburne

                                   Overview

Welcome to altatheism and altatheismmoderated

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the
newsgroups

Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often
come up with the same questions misstatements or misconceptions and post
them to the net  In addition people often request information which has
been posted time and time again  In order to try and cut down on this the
altatheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following
titles

     AltAtheism FAQ Overview for New Readers
     AltAtheism FAQ Introduction to Atheism
     AltAtheism FAQ Frequently Asked Questions FAQ
     AltAtheism FAQ Constructing a Logical Argument
     AltAtheism FAQ Atheist Resources

This is article number   Please read numbers  and  before posting  The
others are entirely optional

If you are new to Usenet you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup
newsannouncenewusers  The articles titled A Primer on How to Work With
the Usenet Community Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet
and Hints on writing style for Usenet are particularly relevant  Questions
concerning how news works are best asked in newsnewusersquestions

If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above see the Finding
Stuff section below

These articles are free  Truly free  You may copy them and distribute them
to anyone you wish  However please send any changes or corrections to the
author and please do not repost copies of the articles to altatheism it
does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating
around the network


                                Finding Stuff

All of the FAQ files should be somewhere on your news system  Here are
some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them

 Check the newsgroup altatheism  Look for subject lines starting with
   AltAtheism FAQ

 Check the newsgroup newsanswers for the same subject lines

   If you don't find anything in steps  or  your news system isn't set up
   correctly and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the
   problem

 If you have anonymous FTP access connect to rtfmmitedu 
   Go to the directory pubusenetaltatheism and you'll find the latest
   versions of the FAQ files there

   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers  If you
   need help in using or getting started with FTP send email to
   mailserverrtfmmitedu with

      send usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq

   in the body

 There are other sites which also carry newsanswers postings  The article
   Introduction to the newsanswers newsgroup carries a list of these
   sites the article is posted regularly to newsanswers

 If you don't have FTP send mail to mailserverrtfmmitedu
   consisting of the following lines

      send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources
      send usenetaltatheismfaq
      send usenetaltatheismintroduction
      send usenetaltatheismlogic
      send usenetaltatheismresources

 Penultimate resort  Send mail to mailservermantiscouk consisting of
   the following lines

      send atheismfaqfaqtxt
      send atheismfaqlogictxt
      send atheismfaqintrotxt
      send atheismfaqresourcetxt

   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files
   There's other stuff too interesting commands to try are help and
   send atheismindex

 Last resort  Mail mathewmantiscouk or post an article to the
   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files  You should only do this
   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed it's not nice to
   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files
   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ though  For instance
   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have 
   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files

Straw man And you brought up leniency
 
 
And what about the simple chance of misjudgements

Misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible
I suspect that it's pretty unlikely that given my requirement

I just love to compare such lines to the common plea of your fellow believers
not to call each others names In this case to substantiate it The Quran
allows that one beATs one's wife into submission


Really Care to give chapter and verse We could discuss it

 
Has been discussed here Chapter and verse were cited I assume that you
weren't looking then
 
Let's be more exact do you think it is not in the Quran And what would
your consequences be when it it was shown to be in it
 
 
Primitive Machism refers to
that I have misspelt that before my fault

Again not all of the Orient follows the Qur'an So you'll have to do
better than that

 
I have not claimed that It is sufficient for the argument when there are
a lot of male dominated societies that qualify as Machistic Are you going
to say that the situation of women is better in sufficeint areas of the
Orient

This is an argument for why you don't like religions that suppress
sex A such it's an irrelevant argument

If you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then
fine My response is then you have given no reason for your statement
that sex is not the business of religion one of your arguments

The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong
measures are required to suppress it If the urge to have sex is so
strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to
find a marriage partner

 
You apparently have trouble reading things you don't like The point was
having sex the way one wishes being a strong desire Marriage is a red
herring Tell me about homosexuals for one You simply ignore everything
that doesn't fit into the world as you would like to have it
 
And as for the situation of adolescents one has probably keep your
combination of leniency and maiming in mind whe you say that it does
not take overly strong measures to suppress the urge for sex in
adolescents

Jon Livesey writes

So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had different
versions of some OT texts   Did I misunderstand

Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in
the world  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of
religion and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real
story that is a bigger headline

Let's back up to   At this point we have the Masoretic text the
various targums translationscommentaries in aramaic etc and the
Septuagint the ancient greek translation  The Masoretic text is the
standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary  In some places it has
obvious corruptions all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy
These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and
to the Septuagint

Now the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars
first it includes additional texts and second in some passages there are
variant readings from the masoretic text in addition to fixingpredating
the various corrupted passages  It must be emphasized that to the best of
my knowledge these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars and
have little theological import

The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient copy of almost all of
Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books  There
is also an abundance of other material but as far as I know there is no
sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha the extra texts in the
septuagint  As far as analysis has proceeded there are also variations
between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions  These tend to reflect the
septuagint where the latter isn't obviously in error  Again though the
differences thus far are not significant theologically  There is this big
expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the
material but so far this hasn't happened

The DSS are important because there is almost no textual tradition in the
OT unlike for the NT

Why is the NT tossed out as info on Jesus  I realize it is normally tossed
out because it contains miracles but what are the other reasons

 It is not tossed out as a source but would it be regarded as
unbiased and independant 

Bruce hits the main point simply  as Russell Turpin does in more detail
in his response  All sources are in modern historiography to be used
critically which is simply to say that any claims deriving from them are
subject to specific examination in the light of motives and other HUMAN
considerations as well as the physical background  The critical method
applies BOTH to the original document AND to the uses made of it by others
most emphatically including the historical researchers themselves

wouldn't they be a better reporter than someone who heard about it second 
hand  I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand  I know there is bias
and winners writing history but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best
still apply

But given the critical principle what evidence is there that we have
ANYTHING at ALL from firsthand sources about Jesus  Paul's letters are
indeed firsthand evidence ABOUT PAUL and his interactions  They are as
a result the most historically solid books in the NT  Paul's claims and
descriptions about his conflicts with Jerusalem may not be wie es eigent
lich gewesen  but they are most definitely the comments of a participant
In other words we'd evaluate Paul's statements more or less as we would
the testimony of a witness in court

The gospels are another story altogether  Luke is most assuredly NOT a
firsthand witness  He claims to have gathered material that is closer
to the actual events  but this is a conventional claim in ancient books
and Luke in fact NEVER NAMES a witness or points to any one thing in his
books which derive from any source we can detect behind Luke  John
has a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloved
disciple who is NOT named  We are not bound to accept this claim for
a long time some scholars rejected it outright but even if we do it
makes the fourth gospel as we have it at best secondhand  Neither Mark
nor Matthew make any claims to be firsthand  Later much later Christian
tradition associates the first gosple with Matthew and a possible Aramaic
protogospel and associates Mark with Peter as having something like the
same secondhand status of recounting Peter's preaching of the gospel

Such traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate the
actual data before us  Luke and Matthew both appear to use differently
an anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of logoi words and
deeds of Jesus as well as to be dependent on Mark  This makes their
testimony AT LEAST thirdhand

All that said historians DO attempt to glean whatever they can from the
NT sources and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources for
anything about the earliest Church  They are also extremely important
for the light they cast however refracted through Christian biases on
the sectarian world of Judaism just before and around the time of the
destruction of the nd Temple

The problem of the historical Jesus is tricky however  There is a
cycle of fashion on this and we are now near a major high in people
thinking they can discern with historicocritical plausibility some
thing about Jesus' life and opinions from the NT  The difficulty here
which dominated thinking  years ago and will probably return to favor
in another generation  was pointed out by Bultmann after Schweitzer's
treatment at the end of the previous highpoint on the cycle  simply
BECAUSE all our sources have passed through AT LEAST one layer of quite
anonymous shaping WITHIN the early Church we have no easy and reliable
way to distribute ANY part of the material between real history and the
inventions of the Church  There are few radical skeptics who think we
have nothing of history in the gospels though such a position can be
maintained but neither have we any tools that can distinguish shaping
of real historical material by its communal use as opposed to invention

 You take LSD and it skews your perception of reality You come down

I've never taken LSD but read about the strange lifes and times
of the Ashbury Heights culture Something that was usually profound
was the way these LSD trippers mentioned that after their first trip
they changed their view of the world In other words taking LSD would 
change their reference frames Which would indicate that deep changes
due to let us say rewiring of the brain temporarily will indeed
change frames And this leads to the statement that there is no
solid reference frame the LSD trippers modified their relative 
view

Much of the HaightAshbury crowd probably had preexisting 
dissatisfactions with their lives  dissatisfactions ameliorated by
mumbojumbo about 'new realities' The only change I experienced after 
LSD was to gain the knowledge that I didn't enjoy how LSD twisted my
perception

This is fascinating Atheists argue for abortion defend homosexuality

What atheists are you talking about  

IMNSHO Abortion is the womans choice  Homosexual sex is the choice of 
the people involved  War is sometimes necessary  

This leaves capital punishment  I oppose capital punishemnt because 
mistakes can happen yes this thread went around with no resolution
recently

As far as poplulation control I think contraception and education are
the best courses of action

I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war an
excellent means of controlling population growth or to capital
punishment I'm sorry but the logic escapes me

That's because you are again making the assumption that all Atheists 
have some specific mindset

And why just capital punishment what is being questioned here the
propriety of killing or of punishment What is the basis of the
ecomplaint

Mistakes can happen Bill and I could be the victim of such a mistake

Occam's Razor is not a law of nature it is way of analyzing an
argument even so it interesting how often it's cited here and to
what end 
It seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being
primitive simpleminded and unscientific antiintellectual and
childish and yet again condemned as being too complex Occam's
razor the scientific explanation of things being much more
straightforeward and apparently simpler 

Cute characterization Bill however there is no inconsistency between 
the two statements  Even if one believes that religion is primitive 
simpleminded and unscientific antiintellectual and childish one
can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of
complexity to the explanation  The ideas themselves don't have to be
complex before being excised by Occam's Razor they only have to add 
unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description

                                           Which is it to be  which
is the nonessential and how do you know

I think the nonessential part of an explanatory system is one that
adds no predictive capability to the system

Considering that even scientists don't fully comprehend science due to
its complexity and diversity Maybe William of Occam has performed a
lobotomy kept the frontal lobe and thrown everything else away

Plus questions for you  why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so 
het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism 

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism it provides more power and ability to
control events

I think you lose the right to talk about THE truth once you say values are
relative   Accuracy is a value judgement too  It so happens I agree with 
the substance of what you say below but it's clear to me that at least 
some values are objective  Truth is better than falsehood peace is
better than war education is better than ignorance  We know these things
if we know anything

While I'll agree that these are generally held to be good things I
question whether they come very close to being objective values
Especially considering that at one time or another each has been
viewed as being undesirable  I doubt you could even come up with
anything that could be said to be universally good or bad

And when I referred to the truth I was using the term
hypothetically realizing full well that there may not even be such a
thing

Assuming for the moment that morals are relative then two
relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results

No they cannot because they acknowledge up front that THE desired
results do not exist  That after all is the meaning of compromise

Plus some problems If the relativists have no values in common compromise 
is impossible  what happens then    Who if anyone is right  What happens 
if one relativist has a value Never compromise  A value plant bombs in 
crowded shopping areas  After all if morals are relative these values 
cannot meaningfully be said to be incorrect

True enough  But they cannot be said to be anything more than
personal morals  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any
sense of personal accountability  the justification for any
socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some higher authority
aka absolute moral truth

Assuming that there is an absolute morality two disagreeing 
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right there
is no room for compromise  Once you beleive in absolute morals
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral

Untrue  One can accept that one does not know the whole truth  Part
of the objective truth about morality may well be that flexibility is
better than rigidity compromise is better than believing you have a lock
on morals etc  In the same way I can believe in an objective reality
without claiming to know the mechanism for quantum collapse or who shot
JFK

An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth
Interesting notion   

Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is
good  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most
people do very successfully  I suppose one could hold compromise as
being an absolute moral but then what happens when someone else
insists on no compromise  How do you compromise on compromising

Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention
I'd say that compromise seems to be better

And I would agree   But it's bloody to pointless to speak of it if it's
merely a matter of taste  Is your liking for peace any better founded
than someone else's liking for icecream  I'm looking for a way to say
yes to that question and relativism isn't it

Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing
over another be it morals or consequences people only consider those
aspects which justify a desired action or belief  In justifying a
commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long 
healthy and peaceful lives  While that much may well be true it is
incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war  killing off the most
agressive member of society trimming down the population stimulating
production  The equation is always more complex than presented
To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own
conscience  desires is to unduly simplify it

So instead of calling it interest on deposits you call it returns on investements
and instead of calling loans you call it investing in business that is in other words
floating stocks in your company 

No interest is different from a return on an investment  For one
thing a return on an investment has greater risk and not a set return
ie the amount of money you make can go up or down or you might even
lose money  The difference is the risk of loss is shared by the
investor rather than practically all the risk being taken by the
borrower when the borrower borrows from the bank


But is it different from stocks   If you wish to call an investor in stocks as
a banker well then its your choice 

Relabeling does not make it interest free 

It is not just relabeling as I have explained above

It  is relabeling 
Also its still not interest free The investor is still taking some money  as
dividend on his investment  ofcourse the investor in islamic banking its your
so called bank  is taking more risk than the usual bank but its still getting some
thing back in return

No if you're going to claim something then it is up to you to prove it
Think Cold Fusion

Well I've provided examples to show that the trend was general and you
or others have provided some counterexamples mostly ones surrounding
mating practices etc  I don't think that these few cases are enough to
disprove the general trend of natural morality  And again the mating
practices need to be reexamined

So what you're saying is that your mind is made up and you'll just explain
away any differences at being statistically insignificant

Try to find immoral nonmatingrelated activities
So you're excluding matingrelatedactivities from your natural morality

No but mating practices are a special case  I'll have to think about it
some more

So you'll just explain away any inconsistancies in your theory as being
a special case

Yes I think that the natural system can be objectively deduced with the
goal of species propogation in mind  But I am not equating the two
as you so think  That is an objective system isn't necessarily the
natural one
Are you or are you not the man who wrote
A natural moral system is the objective moral system that most animals
 follow

Indeed  But while the natural system is objective all objective systems
are not the natural one  So the terms can not be equated  The natural
system is a subset of the objective ones

You just equated them  Reread your own words

Now since homosexuality has been observed in most animals including
birds and dolphins are you going to claim that most animals have
the capacity of being immoral

I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral  It isn't harmful although
it isn't helpful either to the mating process  And when you say that
homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom don't you mean bisexuality

A study release in  found that  of female seagulls are lesbians

Well I'm saying that these goals are not inherent  That is why they must
be postulates because there is not really a way to determine them
otherwise although it could be argued that they arise from the natural
goalbut they are somewhat removed
Postulate To assume posit

That's right  The goals themselves aren't inherent

I can create a theory with a postulate that the Sun revolves around the
Earth that the moon is actually made of green cheese and the stars are
the portions of Angels that intrudes into threedimensional reality

You could but such would contradict observations

Now apply this last sentence of your to YOUR theory  Notice how your are
contridicting observations

I can build a mathematical proof with a postulate that given the length
of one side of a triangle the length of a second side of the triangle and
the degree of angle connecting them I can determine the length of the
third side

But a postulate is something that is generally or always found to be
true  I don't think your postulate would be valid

You don't know much math do you  The ability to use SAS to determine the
length of the third side of the triangle is fundemental to geometry

Guess which one people are going to be more receptive to  In order to assume
something about your system you have to be able to show that your postulates
work

Yes and I think the goals of survival and happiness do work  You think
they don't  Or are they not good goals

Goals  postulates

Again if one of the goals of this objectivenatural morality system
you are proposing is survival of the species then homosexuality is
immoral

Attempting to define 'objective morality'

 I'll take a wild guess and say Freedom is objectively valuable  I base
 this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly
 of their freedom so that their every act was contrary to their volition
 almost all would want to complain

      So long as you keep that almost in there freedom will be a
mostly valuable thing to most people That is I think you're really
saying a real big lot of people agree freedom is subjectively valuable
to them That's good and a quite nice starting point for a moral
system but it's NOT UNIVERSAL and thus not objective

 Therefore I take it that to assert or
 believe that Freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see
 that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on
 a rainy day

      It isn't in Sahara

Natural morality may specifically be thought of as a code of ethics that
a certain species has developed in order to survive
Wait  Are we talking about ethics or morals here

Is the distinction important

Yes

We see this countless
times in the animal kingdom and such a natural system is the basis for
our own system as well
Huh

Well our moral system seems to mimic the natural one in a number of ways

Please describe these number of ways in detail  Then explain the any
contradictions that may arise

In order for humans to thrive we seem to need
to live in groups
Here's your problem  we SEEM to need  What's wrong with the highlighted
word

I don't know  What is wrong  Is it possible for humans to survive for
a long time in the wild  Yes it's possible but it is difficult  Humans
are a social animal and that is a cause of our success

Define difficult

and in order for a group to function effectively it
needs some sort of ethical code
This statement is not correct

Isn't it  Why don't you think so

Explain the laws in America stating that you have to drive on the right
hand side of the road

And by pointing out that a species' conduct serves to propogate itself
I am not trying to give you your tautology but I am trying to show that
such are examples of moral systems with a goal  Propogation of the species
is a goal of a natural system of morality
So anybody who lives in a monagamous relationship is not moral  After all
in order to ensure propogation of the species every man should impregnate
as many women as possible

No  As noted earlier lack of mating such as abstinence or homosexuality
isn't really destructive to the system  It is a worst neutral

So if every member of the species was homosexual this wouldn't be destructive
to the survival of the species

For that matter in herds of horses only the dominate stallion mates  When
he diesis killedwhatever the new dominate stallion is the only one who
mates  These seems to be a case of your natural system of morality trying
to shoot itself in the figurative foot

Again the mating practices are something to be reexamined

The whole theory needs to be reexamined

 Simple  Take out some physics books and start looking for statements which

Perhaps you have a different understanding of what physics is  If we
can't measure anything objectively then the answers we get from physics
aren't objective either  That's what I mean when I say there's no objective
physics

Sure we can all agree that say F  GMmr but that's maths  It's only
physics when you relate it to the real world and if we can't do that
objectively we're stuck  Of course this displays my blatant bias towards
applied science but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real

It's an axiom that it's invariant  But if the two of us measure it we'll
get different answers  Yes we call that experimental error but it's not
really error in the conventional sense in fact if you don't get any
that's an error 

You could argue that the value of c is objective to within  some
value  But I'd call that a rather odd usage of the word objective and
it opens the way for statements like Murder is objectively wrong for all
people to within  of the total population

 Put like this I can't answer I was originally pointing out that your

 tend to ignore all kinds of effects

When they're not important yes  All scientists do  Otherwise science would
never get anywhere

                                     your original posting stated that
 when doing chemistry it is common to ignore atomic interactions

Hang about  not atomic interactions in general  Just specific ones which
are deemed unimportant  Like gravitational interactions between ions which
are so small they're drowned out by electrostatic effects and so on

 Has there been some revolution in teaching methods in the last four years
 
 Perhaps this revolution has yet to reach Cambridge my now I'll get
 flamed for sure 

Oh probably  They still make people memorize equations and IR spectra 
Maybe in a few decades they'll discover the revolutionary data book

O'Dwyer says

   
Specifically I'd like to know what relativism concludes when two
people grotesquely disagree  Is it

a Both are right

b One of them is wrong and sometimes though perhaps rarely we have a
    pretty good idea who it is

c One of them is wrong but we never have any information as to who so
    we make our best guess if we really must make a decision

d The idea of a right moral judgement is meaningless implying that
     whether peace is better than war eg is a meaningless question
     and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer

e Something else  A short positive assertion would be nice

As I hope you can tell b and c are actually predicated on
the assumption that values are real   so statements like these
can't consistently derive from the relativist assumption that values
aren't part of objective reality

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question but the way you
phrase the question makes it unanswerable  The concepts of right
and wrong or correctincorrect or truefalse belong to the
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions  It makes no
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong although it is
legitimate to ask if it is good or better than another position

Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives
of epistemology and ethics  perception and motivation respectively
One can certainly ask if a percept is right correct true
veridical or wrong incorrect false illusory  But it makes little
sense to ask if a motive is true or false  On the other hand it is
strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil but one can
certainly ask that question about motives

Therefore your suggested answers ac simply can't be considered
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment

Now the problem with d is that it is doublebarrelled  I agree with
the first part that the rightness of a moral position is a
meaningless question for the reasons stated above  But that is
irrelevant to the alleged implication not an implication at all that
one cannot feel peace is better than war  I certainly can make
value judgments bad better best without asserting the correctness
of the position

Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ad  My short e answer is
that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue
neither is right correct or wrong incorrect  They simply hold
different moral values feelings

 The same way that any theory is proven false  You examine the
predicitions
 that the theory makes and try to observe them  If you don't or
if you
 observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen then you
have some
 evidence against the theory  If the theory can't be modified to
 incorporate the new observations then you say that it is false

 But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment In
many types of
 experiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will
happen again
 and be capable of being observed For example in chemistry someone
may predict
 the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that
reaction
 repeatedly

There are several problems here First you are discussing only
experimental procedures Observational procedures are also useful  The
main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make
prediction about asyet unmade observations The observations could be
the result of an experiment or they could be obsevations of activity
occuring spontaneossly in nature or they could even be observations of
the lasting results of events long past All that matters is that the
observations be new  This is what prediction is about in science 
it is
not about predicting the future except in this very restricted
sense

Secondly repeatability can also take many forms  It is really just
the
requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results
The
observation of a fossil is 'repeatable' since any qualified observer
may
look at it this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum  Also
there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will
correspond
to the current one  New fossils are found often enough that this is
tested regularly  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some
conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils

Unfortunately for you the models that were falsified have alway been
peripheral to the model of evolution we now have  For instance the
front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles
rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed

So in fact histoircal science findings are repeatable in the
necessary sense  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the
original
event does not make it impossible to make valid observations

This is not to say that biologists would not go coocoo if extra
terrestrial life were discovered  that could make the determination
of the process of abiogenesis relatively easy

The intent of my post as I remember it was to show that you cannot
argue against any religion or ideology for that matter by the actions
of those who claim to be its followers  You have to look at the
teachings of the religion or the principles of the ideology itself
There is no getting around this

So to argue against Islam you have to go to the Qur'an  Bringing up
Khomeini or anyone else is relevant to discussing Khomeini but not
necessarily relevant to discussing Islam as a religion

Sorry Fred but for the purposes under discussion here I must
disagree  Your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue
against communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires since
those did not represent true communism  In judging the practical
consequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today
it is precisely the Khomeini's of the world the Rushdiefatwa
supporters and perhaps more importantly the reaction of the world
Muslim community to those extremists that we must look to  Perhaps
unfortunately from your perspective most people are not concerned
with whether Islam is the right religion for them or whether the
Qur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia but how
Islam affects the world around them or what their lives might be like
if Islam gains in influence  When I consider such possibilities it
is with not inconsiderable fear

This post of mine also illustrates that I am not simply a reactionary
who hates any book which doesn't go out of its way to avoid upsetting
religionists 

Only those you haven't actually read  Sorry but the irony remains

I reiterate for the nth time also that I don't agree with K's fatwa 
nor do I support censorship My point in the original thread has been 
to show why Rushdie is not particularly due sympathy by those who hold 
their religion in high esteem and don't enjoy seeing things which slander
it like the story of the Satanic Verses as opposed to the Rushdie's
TSV played with for amusement

So although you don't agree with the fatwa and apparently don't think
Rushdie should be killed for his book yet you think he is not due
sympathy for being being under this threat  Furthermore you base this
reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular
wellknown story which  if true  might reflect poorly on the
absolute truth of your religion  Yet this opinion is formed without
recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context
accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this
book contains and what the author's motivations are  And then you
come forward and recommend another book which touches on presumably
plays with religioushistorical material because you find its
overall presentation neutral

This is fascinating Atheists argue for abortion defend homosexuality
as a means of population control insist that the only values are
biological and condemn war and capital punishment According to
Benedikt if something is contardictory it cannot exist which in
this case means atheists I suppose
I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war an
excellent means of controlling population growth or to capital
punishment I'm sorry but the logic escapes me

First you seem to assume all atheists think alike  An atheist does not
believe in the existence of a god  Our opinions on issues such as 
capital punishment and abortion however vary greatly  

If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist Benedikt I 
presume then please present your argument as such and do not lump us
all together

As for the issues let's start with abortion  Personally I do not support
abortion as a means of population control or contraceptionafterthefact
However I support the right of any woman to have an abortion regardless
of what my personal views may be because it would be arrogant of me to tell
any individual what heshe may or may not do to hisher body and the domain
of legislators should not extend into the uterus  That's my opinion and I
am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me

I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control but I 
certainly defend it as an end to itself  I think most homosexuals would
be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as
nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down  

As for atheists believing all values are biological I have no idea what
you're talking about

Finally there are the issues of war and capital punishment  An atheist
can object to either one just as easily as a theist might  You seem to
be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and 
population control  Could this be the atheist cause you were referring 
to a few posts back

are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals

I disagree  In the end the individual is responsible for hisher own
irrationality  The individual's belief in some dogmatic religion is a 
symptom of that irrationality

Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists

Atheists and agnostics I would imagine but yes that was my point  An
atheist would theoretically be just as illequipped to study the philosophy
of religion as a Christian and yet there is a persistence of atheists
among the ranks of philosophers  Therefore the conflict between one's
religious beliefs or lack thereof and the ability to be a philosopher
must not be as great as you assert  The fact that most philosophers may
be nonreligious was a secondary point


Science as would be practiced by atheists in contrast has a
BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma

As opposed to science practiced by theists  Be careful here

Science does have a builtin defence against faith and dogma
skepticism  Unfortunately it is not foolproof  There is that 
wonderful little creature known as the theory  Many of us believe in
the theory of evolution  We have no absolute proof that this 
theory is true so why do we believe it  Because it makes more 
sense than  There is quite a bit of faith involved here


A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to
suit whatever is the best information available at the time AND
AND AND a scientist understands that any current beliefs
are deficient in some way

Well not ALL current beliefs are deficient but basically I agree


Can you see the difference  Science views beliefs as being flawed
and new information can be obtained to improve them

Ideally this is true  In reality though you have to acknowledge
that scientists are human  Scientists have egos and biases  Some
scientists assume a particular theory is true refuse to admit the
flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever and proceed
to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof 
for the theory  Remember cold fusion


By the way I wasn't aware mass suicide
was a problem  Waco and Jonestown were isolated incidents  
Mass suicides are far from common

Clinton and the FBI would love for you to convince them of this
It would save the US taxpayer a lot of money if you could

Not really  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco
crisis  I believe especially considering the outcome
My point was that mass suicides in the US are rare Jonestown was
in Guyana incidentally although we footed the bill for the cleanup
and the US has far more important issues to address  Compare the
number of US citizens who have died in mass suicides with say the
number of US soldiers who died during one week of the Vietnam War and
you will see my point

 I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either  They are extremely useful
 mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make
 Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model  Gravity too is
 very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected but we
 have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
 objects by this thing we call gravity  Gravity however is not 
 a fact  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
 behave in our physical environment  Newton thought gravity was a
 simple vector force Einstein a wave Both are very useful models that 
 have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
 want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
 the way the theory now formulated talks about it  That takes a great 
 leap of faith which of course is what religion takes  Evolution
 is no different

Atoms are not objective  They aren't even real  What scientists call

 The death penalty IS a deterrent Dave  The person executed will never
 commit a crime again  Guaranteed        

That means that it is an effective antirecidivism measure  It does
not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime
in the first place

The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually
stop one from murdering  Or commiting treason  are there any other
capital crimes anywhere in the USA  That is if there were no death
penalty would its introduction deter a wouldbe criminal from
committing herhis crime  I doubt it

This is only the first step  Even if it were a strong deterrent
short of being a complete deterrent I would reject it  For what
about the case of the innocent executed

And even if we could eliminate this possibility I would reject the
death penalty as immoral This makes me something of a radical on
the issue although I think there are many opponents of captial
punishment who agree with me but who find the innocent executed the
strongest argument to make

I would if magically placed in charge facilitate stateaided suicide
for criminals who have lifesentences  This could be a replacement
for capital punishment  Those who don't want to live the rest of
their lives in jail would always have this option

 If some society came up with a good reason for why rape and murder are ok I 
 would be consistent with my position and hold that it was still wrong  My 
 basis of morality is not on societal norms or on current legalities  My
 basis is surprise surprise on both the Bible and on inherent moral
 abhorrences

      AH But what exactly is inherently abhorrent and WHY is it so
What you're saying is in effect I think some things are repulsive
and I know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me so they
should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever period

      Which in and of itself is nice enough to some extent I agree with
you But I do not agree that things are 'inherently' or 'absolutely'
immoral they are labeled 'immoral' each for its own good reason and if
the reason can even theoretically change then so can the label


 Yes that's vague and the only way I know off the top of my head to
 defend it is to say that all humans are similarly made Yes that falls
 into the trap of creation

      No it doesn't Humans are to some extent similar because we all
belong to the same species that that species has evolved is another
story altogether To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence
to moral absolutism of a flavour


 My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust goodness 
 love respect courage and honesty in any society rather than deceipt
 hatred disrespect cowardness and dishonesty

      You're saying morality is what'll keep society alive and kicking
It is I think up to a point but societies are not all alike and
neither are their moralities

 No I haven't been everywhere and 
 seen everyone but according to my thesis I don't have to since I hold that
 we were all created similarly

      Similar  identical

 If that makes an unfalsifiable thesis just say
 so and I'll both work out what I can and punt to fellow theists

      No it's falsifiable through finding someoe who was created
different whatever that might be in the real world

them to be upsets you

You have done no such thing


BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank 
what will someone bet me they weren't real Islamic owners and
operators

An Islamic bank is a bank which operates according to the rules
of Islam in regard to banking This is done explicitly by the
bank This was not the case with BCCI

And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into
BCCI rather than the nasty interestmotivated western bank down
the street   

This is crap BCCI was motivated by the same motives as other
international banks with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with
outlaws and the intelligence services of various governments

So please don't try to con us into thinking that it will all 
work out right next time

Back to childish propaganda again You really ought to get a life
rather than wasting bandwith on such empty typing There are thousands
of Islamic banks operating throughout the world which noone ever hears
about If you want to talk about corrupted banks we can talk about
all the people who've been robbed by American banks

I see that you still can't grasp the obvious is it because your are devious
by nature or can you only find fault with an argument by
misrepresenting it

I plainly said that I was stating the Christian position as I
understand it I did not say whether I agree with it since my point
was that the only flaws in that position are those atheists invent
I have never claimed to be an expert on anything and especially
Christianity but I have made it an object of pretty intense study
over the years so I feel qualified to discuss what its general
propositions are

What offends you is that I have exposed the distortions and
misrepresentations of Christianity you contrive and then rail against
which seems more like the classical strawman dodge than what I said
This leaves you with nothing but to attack but me As usual you
avoid the larger issues by picking away at the insignificant stuff why not

	That is not an atheism mythology in any sense of the word
Religious paradoy would be significantly more appropriate

	The nd part is rendered null and void by the simple fact that I
do know several strong atheists I am sure that others do I myself am
strong in the sense that I find the standard concept of God without any
meaning Any attempt to bring meaning either results in the destruction of 
the viability of language or in internal self contradiction

The rest of the article is mere rationalisation You may claim that
sanitation plants are strategic legitimate targets but what happens to
the civilians in a city with no sewer system What happens to the
civilians when you destroy water purification plants And when hospitals
can't handle the resultant epidemics because there is no more electricity

And what exactly are your sources We have all I'm sure seen Postol's

 How does that qualify
 Indeed it's almost oxymoronica rather amusing instance
 I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheistviews as

 Many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but
 they don't meet the other criterions

The myth to which I refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have

including Christainity in a rational manner and debating its claims
as the are stated atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then

 You accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to

Here's a good example of of what I said above Read the post again I
said Acoording to  which means I am referring to Christian
doctrine as I understand it if I am speaking for myself you'll know
it My purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of Christain
doctrines since it seemed germane

Bill

 with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it
 means When atheists claim that they do not know if God exists and
 don't know what He wants they contradict the Bible which clearly says
 that everyone knows The authority of the Bible is its claim to be

 should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting
 it across  You may trust the Bible but your trusting it doesn't
 make it any more credible to me
 If the Bible says that everyone knows that's clearly reason
 to doubt the Bible because not everyone knows your alleged
 god's alleged existance

Again I am paraphrasing Christian doctrine which is very clear on this
point your dispute is not with me 

Bill

 refuted while the specieswide condemnation is justified Those that
 claim that there is no evidence for the existence of God or that His will is
 unknown must deliberately ignore the Bible the ignorance itself is
 no excuse

  No they don't have to ignore the Bible  The Bible is far
 from universally accepted  The Bible is NOT a proof of god
 it is only a proof that some people have thought that there
 was a god  Or does it prove even that  They might have been
 writing it as series of fiction shortstories  As in the
 case of Dionetics  Assuming the writers believed it the
 only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it
 And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the
 interpretations and Biblicalphilosophers were correct

  There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible

  Again read the FAQ

 Here again you miss the point The Bible itself is not the point
it's what it contains It makes no difference who accpets the Bible or
even who's unaware of its existence Christians hold that it applies
universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate
and the same innate knowledge of God

 See above

 If you read my post with same care as read the FAQ we wouldn't be
having this conversation

Bill

 freedom You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to
 ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known
 in both cases That an atheist can't accept the evidence means only

 Bzztwrong answer
 Gravity is directly THERE  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and
 rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it  God on the
 other hand doesn't generally show up in the supermarket except
 on the tabloids  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence
 Gravity is obvious gods aren't

As I said the evidence is there you just don't accept it here at
least we agree

Bill

 Secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of God so
 much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature Human reason
 always comes back to the question of God in every generation and in

 No human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of
 God it has usually come back to the existance of god
 In other words it doesn't generally come back to the xtian
 god it comes back to whether there is any god  And in much
 of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn't pop up as
 the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces
 are and which ones are out there  From a worldwide view
 human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to
 be andor what forces are currently in control  A natural
 tendancy to believe in God only exists in religious wishful
 thinking

Yes human reason does always come back to the existence of God we're
having this discussion are we not

Bill

 I said all this to make the point that Christianity is eminently
 reasonable that Divine justice is just and human nature is much
 different than what atheists think it is Whether you agree or not

 YOU certainly are not correct on human nature  You are at
 the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric
 approach  Try looking at the outside world as well when
 you attempt to sum up all of humanity

anything European is contemptable but I thought this kind of

 Are you saying that their was a physical Adam and Eve and that all humans are direct decendents of only these two human beings  Then who were Cain and Able's wives  Couldn't be their sisters because AE didn't have daughters  Were they nonhumans

Okay all humans are direct descendents of of a bunch of hopeful
monsters The human race didn't evolve from one set parents but from
thousands Do you really base your atheist on this

 Considering that something like  out of  humans on this planet don't know instinctively that the Christian god exist the claim of instinctive knowledge doesn't look like it hold much water  Or are you saying that the  billion nonChristians in the world must fight this instinctive urge to acknowledge God and JC

Did I say that people were Christians by nature or did I say that
Christians hold that everyone knows of the God the Christians worship
I would have thought the distinction obvious sorry Read my post

you are just being agumentative Also your wordwrap is screwed up or

trajancwisunomahaedu Stephen McIntyre writes

 It usually all has to do with how the child is
      brought up  From the time he is born the
      theist is brought up with the notion of the
      truth of some kind of scripture the Bible
      the Torah the Qur'an  etc  He is told
      of this wondrous God who wrote or inspired
      the scripture of the prophets talked about in
      the scripture of the miracles performed  etc
      He is also told that to question this as
      children are apt to do is a sin a crime
      against God and to lose belief in the scrip
      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell
      Thus by the time he is able to read the
      scripture for himself the belief in its truth
      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
      matter of course

You're missing something here  There are people who convert from
nontheism to theism after being brought up in a nontheist household  I
don't have any statistics as to how many though  That would be an
interesting thing to know  

Well I was raised as an athiest and eventually took on a theistic
view However I try to be a rationalist as well as a theist Anyhow
I will try to make some comments on your observations just to 
contribute some datapoints from a different perspective

I think that religion is a crutch  People are
naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable  People don't want
to believe that when they die they are dead finished  That there is
nothing else after that  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy

Religion can be a crutch Before going much further on that thread
I would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of world
religions out there though There are athiestic religions as well as
theistic religions There are religions that claim knowledge about
such things as an afterlife and there are religions that make no such
claims 

My perspective is that lots of people talk but all that means is that
talk is cheap When someone gives me substantial evidence about an
afterlife then I'll start believing in one In the mean while my
religion deals with what we know exists that is life here and now

Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe things
science has not yet described and it also gives people a feeling of
security that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok

Again some religions do and others do not Some religions teach people
that life is chaotic and to accept it for what it is

That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions  This
has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these
people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their
belief system for what it gains them  This is why I think it's kind of
useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism  They are happy with
their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too
they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept
the harsh reality that they are running from

I'll tell you that I moved from an athiestic perspective to a theistic
one because I believe that I observed phenomenon that was better 
explained from the theistic perspective while the athiestic perspective
could not explain it However that does not mean that I'm willing to
accept a lot of fourth hand gobblygook that contridicts modern science
along with my theistic perspective

I don't think so  Although some forms of execution are painful the electric
chair looks particularly so I think the pain is relatively shortlived
Drawing and quartering on the other hand looks very painful and the
victim wouldn't die right away he'd bleed to death I'd imagine
Ah so a cruel punishment is not just if it is painful as you 
origionally stated It is about long term pain eg non shortlived
Why this sudden chance in your stance

I don't think I've changed my stance at all  My original stance was that
a painless execution was not a cruel one  I didn't say what would be
considered cruel only that a painless death wasn't  Now cruelty must
involve some sort of suffering I believe  I don't think someone that gets
shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much  Even a hanging
probably produces one sharp instance of pain but it's over so quickly

Hmmmmm

Pardon

Could it be that a counter example has been made which renders your 
previous stance null and void Why don't you admit that your previous stance 
is incorrect Or if you somehow managed to slip up and misstated your 
origional stance why not admit it

No  Well again I stated that a painless death isn't cruel but I don't
think I stated that all painful executions are cruel  I think that some
are cruel depending on the nature and duration of the pain

By the way how long is too long

Anything more than an instant I guess  Any death by suffocation
asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel I think this includes the
gas chamber and drawing and quartering  I'd say that any pain that
lasts say over twenty seconds or so would be too long but this may
be an arbitrary cutoff I suppose

 This is complete nonsense  Relativism means saying that there is no absolut
 standard of morality it does NOT mean saying that all standards of morality
 are equally good
 
 Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than
 others

False  Not stating X is not equivalent to stating not x

 How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of
 reference

There is no objective way of measuring the goodness' of a moral
system  It's a value judgement  Therefore there is so objective
comparison for moral systems  Therefore there is no best' moral
system

 And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
 it isn't an objective reality for values

Similarly there is no frame of reference that can be used to
objectively compare frames of reference  Any such choice is
arbitrary

Which is NOT to say that one should not take up reference frames for
various purposes

There is nothing to believe  not even this statement

 I love god just as much as she loves me If she wants to seduce me
 she'll know what to do 

 But if HeShe did you would probably consider it rape  

Of course not I would think that would be great fun not having ever
felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze
This is not what I got when I believed  I just tried to hide my fear
of getting punished for something I never was sure of The Bible is
hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure God did
not answer In the end I found I had been following a mass delusion
a lie I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint
of her existence

 Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe So  

I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe
and analyse their position In fact it is amusing to note in this
context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the
opposite  one should not examine one's belief critically

I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this
group two months ago A day after I finally found out my faith is over
I decided to try just one more time The same cycle of emotional
responses fired once again but this time the delusion lasted only
a couple of hours I told my friend in a phone that it really works
thank god just to think about it again when I hung up I had to admit
that I had lied and fallen prey to the same illusion

 No one asks you to swallow everything in fact Jesus warns against it   But let
 me ask you a question  Do you beleive what you learn in history class or for
 that matter anything in school  I mean it's just what other people have told
 you and you don't want to swallow what others say right  

I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger or what
other people told me but I grew more and more skeptical the more I
read I learned what it means to use reason

As a student of chemistry I had to perform a qualitative analysis
of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab I hated experiments
like this  they are oldfashioned and increase the student's workload
considerably Besides I had to do it twice since I failed in my first
attempt However I think I'll never forget the lesson 

No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X
it may still be Y It is very tempting to jump into conclusions take
a leap of faith assure oneself ignore the data which is inconsistent 
But it can still be wrong 

I found out that I was after all using exactly the same mechanism
to believe in god  mental selfassurance suspension of fear 
filtering of information In other words it was only me no god
playing any part 

 The life  death and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact

Oh And I had better believe this Dan many UFO stories are much better
documented than the resurrection of Jesus The resurrection is documented
quite haphazardly in the Bible  it seems the authors did not pay too
much attention to which wild rumour to leave out Besides the ends of
the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions for instance
the end of Mark  is missing from many early texts says my Bible

Jesus may have lived and died but he was probably misunderstood

 As much
 as anything else you learn  How do you choose what to believe and 
 what not to

This is easy I believe that the world exists independent of my mind
and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I
observe Nothing else need to be taken on faith I will go by the
evidence 

It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not
I assume that he did considering the vast amount of evidence presented

 There is no way to get into a sceptical heart  You can not say you have 
 given a 
 sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have  You must TRUST 
 not just go 
 to church and participate in it's activities  Were you ever willing to
 die for what you believed  

A liar how do you know what my attitude was Try reading your Bible
again 

I was willing to die for my faith Those who do are usually remembered
as heroes at least among those who believe Dan do you think I'm
lying when I say I believed firmly for  years It seems it is 
very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not
do so anymore But I can't go on lying to myself

Blind trust is dangerous and I was just another blind led by the blind
But if god really wants me she'll know what to do I'm willing I just
don't know whether she exists  looking at the available evidence
it looks like she doesn't

Sounds like you were going to a different Penn State or something
Kampus Krusade for Khrist is very vocal here but they really have
little power to get anything done  Sometimes it seems like there
are a lot of them because they're generally more vocal than their
opposition but there really aren't that many Krusaders

The liberals tend to keep to themselves if they can help it since
all they really want is to be allowed to go about their own lives
the way they want to  so you don't hear from or about most of
them  The biblebangers stand out because they want everyone to
be forced to live according to biblebanger rules

The Krusaders certainly don't run this place

I'd say we've got a rather average mix of people here
much like the rest of the US  And just like everywhere else
some factions are louder than others

  So in conclusion it can be shown that there is essentially no
  logical argument which clearly differentiates a cult from a
  religion  I challenge anyone to produce a distinction which
  is clear and can't be easily knocked down  

 How about this one a religion is a cult which has stood the test
 of time

Just like history is written by the winners' and not the losers'
From what I've seen of religions a religion is just a cult that
was so vile and corrupt it was able to exert it's doctrine using
political and military measures  Perhaps if Koresh withstood the
onslaught for another couple of months he would have started 
attracting more converts due to his strength' hence becoming a
full religion and not just a cult

  I think you're letting atheist mythology

 Great start  I realize immediately that you are not interested
 in discussion and are going to thump your babble at me  I would
 much prefer an answer from Ms Healy who seems to have a
 reasonable and reasoned approach to things  Say aren't you the
 creationist guy who made a lot of silly statements about
 evolution some time ago

 Duh gee then we must be talking Christian mythology now  I
 was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable logical
 person but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition
 of the same boring mythology I've seen a thousand times before
 I am deleting the rest of your remarks unless I spot something
 that approaches an answer because they are merely a repetition
 of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought
 at all

 I have to congratulate you though Bill  You wouldn't
 know a logical argument if it bit you on the balls  Such
 a persistent lack of function in the face of repeated
 attempts to assist you in learning which I have seen
 in this forum and others in the past speaks of a talent
 that goes well beyond my own meager abilities  I just don't
 seem to have that capacity for ignoring outside influences

 Dean Kaflowitz

Dean

Reread your comments do you think that merely characterizing an
argument is the same as refuting it Do you think that ad hominum
attacks are sufficient to make any point other than you disapproval of
me Do you have any contribution to make at all

 jim halat

 This deserves framing  It really does  Atoms aren't even real

 Tell me then those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are
 atoms now so what are they  Figments of our imaginations  The
 evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming but I won't bother with
 most evidence at the moment

You would have us believe that what the eye perceives as images are
actaully there  as perceived This may be interesting I thought
that an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of light
can illuminate any object of atomic scale If this image is to have
useful resolution wouldn't the illuminating sources wavelength have
to be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed

If an atom is a probablity cloud lower resolutions would give the
appearance of solidity but it seems fairly certain that an atom is
not an object is any conventional sense Obviously I am not a
physicist but the question does have ramification of a philosophic
nature Anyway just a stray thought carry on

 Very true length of time for discussions on creationism vs evolutionism 
 Atheists and Christians have been debating since  and still debate with 
 unabated passion 

Mike

I've seen referrences to Creation vs Evolution several times in aa
and I have question Is either point of view derived from direct
observation can either be scientific I wonder if the whole
controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the Truth
rather than the truth itself 
Both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome and I can't help
wondering which came first As I've pointed out elsewhere my view of
human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing
anyhthing objectively  all knowledge is inherently subjective So in
the context of aa would you take a stand based on what you actually
know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell
the difference

I'll accept this as a compliment although I'm always a little paranoid
when visiting aa thanks Yes I do know the extent of the statements
relevence it's what I think of as human nature I'm not sure it
undermines either religion or atheism since both claim special
knowledge about the Truth and since such claims are always suspect
all we can learn from it is that humans are a very arrogant species
My point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human
claims The trick here then is to find some way to abstract our
infinitely fallible nature from whatever reality is out there so we
can see what there is to see I can think of no way this can be done

                            FREEENERGY TECHNOLOGY
                       by Robert E McElwaine Physicist
          
               Ninety to a hundred years ago everybody knew that a 
          heavierthanair machine could not possibly fly  It would 
          violate the laws of physics  All of the experts and 
          authorities said so 
          
               For example Simon Newcomb declared in   The 
          demonstration that no possible combination of known 
          substances known forms of machinery and known forms of 
          force can be united in a practical machine by which man 
          shall fly long distances through the air seems to the writer 
          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any 
          physical fact to be 
          
               Fortunately a few SMART people such as the Wright 
          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final 
          word  Now we take airplanes for granted except when they 
          crash 
          
               Today orthodox physicists and other scientists are 
          saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy' 
          Technologies using negative terms such as pseudoscience 
          and perpetual motion and citing socalled laws which 
          assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed st law 
          of thermodynamics and there is always a decrease in useful 
          energy nd law of thermodynamics  The physicists do not 
          know how to do certain things so they ARROGANTLY declare 
          that those things cannot be done  Such PRINCIPLES OF 
          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern science and help to 
          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox 
          modern theories 
          
               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a 
          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe with
          OUT burning any kind of fuel making them the PERFECT 
          SOLUTION to the worldwide energy crisis and its associated 
          pollution degradation and depletion of the environment 
          
               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy 
          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by 
          various forms of induction  UNLIKE solar or wind devices 
          they need little or no energy storage capacity because they 
          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed  Solar energy 
          has the DISadvantage that the sun is often blocked by 
          clouds trees buildings or the earth itself or is reduced 
          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and 
          high latitudes  Likewise wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and 
          often nonexistent  Neither solar nor wind power are 
          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes  Properly 
          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations 
          
               For example at least three US patents  
           and  have so far been awarded for 
          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS seemingly 
          tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic 
          field  The first two require a feedback network in order to 
          be selfrunning  The third one as described in detail in 
          Science  Mechanics magazine Spring  Amazing 
          MagnetPowered Motor by Jorma Hyypia pages   
          and front cover requires critical sizes shapes 
          orientations and spacings of magnets but NO feedback  Such 
          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible 
          heatpump in one's home YEAR ROUND FOR FREE  Complete 
          descriptive copies of US patents are  each from the 
          US Patent Office  Jefferson Davis Hwy Arlington VA  
           correct digit patent number required  Or try 
          getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your 
          local public or university library's interlibrary loan 
          dept 
          
               A second type of freeenergy device such as the 'Gray 
          Motor' US Patent  the 'Tesla Coil' and the 
          motor of inventor Joseph Newman see SCIENCE  pages 
           taps ELECTROMAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from 
          'EARTH RESONANCE' about  cycles per second plus 
          harmonics  They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit 
          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the 
          energy being tapped  It is important that the total 
          'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to 
          'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in 
          order to maximize the power output  This output can also be 
          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER' 
          of a strong Ushaped permanent magnet  In the case of a 
          Tesla Coil slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the 
          secondary coil will enhance output power  Earth Energy

               During the 's an Austrian civil engineer named 
          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an 
          'IMPLOSION TURBINE' German name 'ZOKWENDLE' after 
          analyzing erosion and lack of erosion in differently shaped 
          waterways and developing sophisticated mathematical 
          equations to explain it  As described in the book A 
          Breakthrough to New FreeEnergy Sources by Dan A Davidson 
           water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a 
          LOGARITHMICSPIRALshaped coil of tubing until it reaches a 
          CRITICAL VELOCITY  The water then IMPLODES no longer 
          touching the inside walls of the tubing and drives the pump 
          which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC 
          GENERATOR  The device seems to be tapping energy from that 
          of the earth's rotation via the 'Coriolis effect' LIKE A 
          TORNADO   It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY  
          
               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock 
          Air Motor' US Patent  which is a cross between 
          a diesel engine it has three cylinders with a compression 
          ratio of  to  and a rotary engine with solar and 
          planetary gears  It burns NO FUEL but becomes selfrunning 
          by driving its own air compressor  This engine also 
          generates a lot of heat which could be used to heat 
          buildings and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large 
          trucks preventing their slowing down when climbing hills  
          David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the 
          automatic transmission differential and wheel drive 
          
               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy as shown 
          in the Star Trek shows perhaps by inserting each one between 
          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of 
          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a 
          common household smoke detector 
          
               One other energy source should be mentioned here 
          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free 
          Energy  A Bulgarianborn American Physicist named Joseph 
          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION 
          reactor which he calls 'Migma' which uses NONradioactive 
          deuterium as a fuel available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities 
          from sea water does NOT produce radioactive waste can be 
          converted DIRECTLY into electricity withOUT energywasting 
          steam turbines and can be constructed small enough to power 
          a house or large enough to power a city  And UNLIKE the 
          Tokamaks and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about 
          Migma WORKS already producing at least three watts of power 
          for every watt put in  New Times US version  
          pages  
          
               And then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that 
          have been in the news lately originally conducted by 
          University of Utah researchers B Stanley Pons and Martin 
          Fleischmann  Some US Navy researchers at the China Lake 
          Naval Weapons Center in California under the direction of 
          chemist Melvin Miles finally took the trouble to collect the 
          bubbles coming from such an apparatus had them analyzed with 
          massspectrometry techniques and found HELIUM  which 
          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place and enough 
          of it to explain the excess heat generated 
          
               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two socalled laws 
          of thermodynamics are NOT so absolute  For example the 
          late Physicist Dewey B Larson developed a comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe which he 
          calls the 'Reciprocal System' which he describes in detail 
          in several books such as Nothing But Motion  and The 
          Universe of Motion  in which the physical universe 
          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES the material half and an antimatter 
          half with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing 
          between them withOUT the heat death predicted by 
          thermodynamic laws  His Theory explains the universe MUCH 
          BETTER than modern orthodox theories including phenomena 
          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about and is SELFCONSISTENT in every way  Some 
          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow 
          seemingly converting lowquality energy into highquality 
          energy 
          
               Also certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat' 
          and 'Eckankar' teach their Members that the physical universe 
          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of 
          existence like parallel universes or analogous to TV 
          channels as described in books like The Path of the 
          Masters by Dr Julian Johnson  and Eckankar The Key 
          to Secret Worlds by Sri Paul Twitchell   For example 
          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly 
          called the 'Astral Plane'  Longtime Members of these groups 
          have learned to 'Soul Travel' into these higher worlds and 
          report on conditions there  It seems plausible that energy 
          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical 
          universe or be created at the boundary between them given 
          the right configuration of matter to channel it  This is 
          supported by many successful laboratorycontrolled 
          experiments in PSYCHOKINESIS throughout the world such as 
          those described in the book Psychic Discoveries Behind the 
          Iron Curtain 
          
               In terms of economics the market has FAILED  Inventors 
          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop 
          and massproduce Free Energy Equipment and the conventional 
          energy producer have no desire to do so because of their 
          VETED INTERET  The government is needed to intervene  If 
          the government does not intervene then the total supply of 
          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and 
          will soon run out prices for energy will increase and 
          pollution and its harmful effects including the 'GREENHOUSE 
          EFFECT' acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil 
          spills rape of the land by strip mining etc will continue 
          to increase 
          
               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development 
          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities subsidize 
          private production until the producers can make it on their 
          own and subsidize consumption by lowincome consumers of 
          Free Energy Hardware 
          
               The longrange effects of such government intervention 
          would be widespread and profound  The quantity of energy 
          demanded from conventional energy producer coal mining 
          companie oil companie and countries electric utilitie 
          etc would drop to near zero forcing their employees to 
          seek work elsewhere  Energy resources coal uranium oil 
          and gas would be left in the ground  Prices for 
          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero 
          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high 
          but drop as supply increases as happened with VCR's 
          personal computers etc  Costs of producing products that 
          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease 
          along with their prices to consumers  Consumers would be 
          able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric 
          utility bills or buying home heating fuel  Tourism would 
          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to 
          spend their money for gasoline for their cars  Government 
          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be 
          obtained in some other way  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE 
          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR 
          
               Many conventional energy producer would go out of 
          business but society as a whole and the earth's environment 
          and ecosystems would benefit greatly  It is the People 
          that government should serve rather than the big 
          corporation and bank

 Let us go back  oh say  years or so whatever  Pretend someone says to you
 someday there will be men on the moon  Now remember you still think the
 world is flat  This is quite an extraordinary claim

I think CS Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the
world is flat

However this argument goes both ways Pretend someone telling Plato that
it is highly probable that people do not really have souls their minds
and their consciousness are just something their brains make up and
their brains their body is actually ahead of their mind even in 
voluntarly actions I don't think Plato would have been happy with this
and neither would Paul although Paul's ideas were quite different
However if you would read what we discuss in this group and not
just preach you would see that there currently is much evidence in
favour of these statements

The same applies to the theory of natural selection or other sacred
cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature I don't believe
in spirits devils or immortal souls any more than in gods

 The fact is we can argue the existence of God until the end of time there really is no
 way to either prove or disprove it but there will be a time when we all know the truth  
 I hope and believe I'm right and I hope and pray that you find your way too 

Ah you said it You believe what you want to This is what I had assumed
all along 

 OK maybe I shouldn't have said no way   I guess I really believe there is
 a way  But all I can do is plant seeds  Either they grow or they don't 

You might be as well planting Satan's seeds ever thought of this
Besides you haven't yet explained why we must believe so blindly
without any guiding light at all at least I haven't noticed it
I don't think this is at all fair play on god's part 

Your argument sounds like a version of Pascal's Wager Please read the
FAQ this fallacy is discussed there

 But
 they won't if they're not planted  The Holy Spirit is the nurishment that
 helps them grow and that comes from God

And I failed to get help from the HS because I had a wrong attitude
Sorry Dan but I do not think this spirit exists People who claim to have
access to it just look badly deluded not gifted

In this respect since atheists are dominantly arrogant and claim 
selfcontrol and selfownership they would make pharoahs 
look like very humble decent people in comparison  If the logic is this
since I own myself others who are like me should also own themselves and
going further things are selfexistent and selfstanding and selfliving
etc 

Yes atheists tend to claim self control and self ownership Are you saying
that theists claim to not have self control I don't think atheists are
dominantly arrogant They don't claim some god that has supremacy over
all of mankind Now this claim would be arrogant but atheists don't claim 
it Most atheists do claim to own themselves I think any disagreement with
this claim of self ownership would be supremely arrogant

As per various threads on science and creationism I've started dabbling into a
book called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland 

	As I don't know this book I will use your heresay

 A question
that I had come from one of his comments  He stated that God is not 
necessarily a religious term but could be used as other scientific terms that
give explanation for events or theories without being a proven scientific 
fact

	It depends on how he defines God The way I understand the meaning
of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science Ideas drawn
from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming
scientific assertions that can be falsified that is where we can decide
that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations
drawn from them

	Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within
science to make them more reconcilable and especially subserviant in a basic
way to religious dogma This pursuit always fails

  I think I got his point  I can quote the section if I'm being vague 
The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates  Are there 
explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of
themselves or can everything be quantified measured tested etc  

	Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the
tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge
or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way It
gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge
while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits Science
and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional
answers at best Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful
questions More questions can be posed than it can answer At the basis of
sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve
in contradiction

So when they took the time to copy the text correctly that includes
obvious corruptions

Well yes  This is the real mystery of the matter and why I am rather
dubious of a lot of the source theories

There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text MT of the OT is
obscure and presumably corrupted  These are reproduced exactly from copy to
copy  The DSS tend to reflect the same errors  This would appear to tell
us that at least from some point people began to copy the texts very
exactingly and mechanically  The problem is we don't know what they did
before that  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the
point at which the texts are perceived as texts  They may be added to and
in some situations such as the end of Mark material is lost but for the
most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text

You're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill  Some people
like to use the game of telephone as a metaphor for the transmission of
the texts  This clearly wrong  The texts are transmitted accurately

BR        Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you
BR are referring         to the New Testament  Please detail
BR your complaints or email if         you don't want to post
BR  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and        
BR wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish
BR Historian         who also wrote of Jesus  In addition
BR the four gospel accounts		 are very much in harmony

It is also well known that the comments in Josephus relating to Jesus were
inserted badly by later editors  As for the four gospels being in harmony
on the issue of Jesus  You know not of what you speak  Here are a few
contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension

The death of Judas after the betrayal of Jesus

Acts  Now this man Judas purchased a field with the reward of 
iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his 
bowels gushed out

Matt  And he Judas cast down the pieces of silver in the temple 
and departed and went and hanged himself  And the chief priestsbought 
with them the potter's field

What was Jesus' prediction regarding Peter's denial

Before the cock crow  Matthew 

Before the cock crow twice  Mark 

How many times did the cock crow

MAR   And the second time the cock crew And Peter called to mind  the 
word  that  Jesus  said unto him Before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny
me thrice And when he thought thereon he wept

MAT   Then began he to curse and to swear  saying  I  know not the man
And immediately the cock crew
MAT   And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus  which  said unto him
Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice And he went out and wept
bitterly

LUK   And Peter said Man I know not what thou sayest  And immediately
while he yet spake the cock crew
LUK   And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter And  Peter remembered
the word of the Lord how he had said unto him Before the cock crow thou
shalt deny me thrice

JOH   Jesus answered him Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake 
Verily
 verily I say unto thee The cock shall not crow still thou hast denied me
thrice

JOH   Peter then denied  again  and  immediately  the  cock crew

destruction of cities what said was jeremiah was zechariah

This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made 
Not the only time he does this either

MAT   Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet 
saying  And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was
valued whom they of the children of Israel did value

zechariah 
nothing in Jeremiah remotely like

What was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial

scarlet  Matthew 

purple John 

The time of the Crucifiction

Mark says the third hour or  am but John says the sixth hour noon was
when the sentence was passed

Inscription on the Cross

Matthew    This is Jesus the king of the Jews
Mark	   The King of the Jews
Luke	   This is the king of the Jews
John	   Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews

What did they give him to drink

vinegar  Matthew 

wine with myrrh  Mark 

Women at the Cross

Matthew said many stood far off including Mary Magdaline Mary the mother of
James and the mother of Zebedee's children  Mark and Luke speak of many far
off and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less
John says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross along with her sister and
Mary Magdalene

Jesus' last words 

Matt And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice 
saying Eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say My God my God why
hast thou forsaken me  Jesus when he cried again with a loud voice
yielded u the ghost

Luke And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said Father unto
 thy hands I commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost

John When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said It is 
finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost

Events of the crucifiction

Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent that there was an
earthquake and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graves
opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem appearing to
many beating Jesus to the resurection Mark and Luke speak of darkness and
the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints 
John is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced

Burial of Jesus

Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being
stolen by the disciples and for the tomb to be sealed All of this was
supposedly done but the other gospels do not mention these precautions

How long was Jesus in the tomb
Depends where you look Matthew  gives Jesus prophesying that he will
spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and Mark 
has after three days meta treis emeras he will rise again As far as I can
see from a quick look the prophecies have after three days but the
postresurrection narratives have on the third day

Time of the Resurection

Matthew says Sunday at dawn Mark says the sun was rising and John says it
was dark

 Who was at the Empty Tomb  Is it 

MAT   In the end of the sabbath as it began to  dawn  toward the first
day of the week came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre

MAR   And when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalene and Mary the  mother 
of  James and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and
anoint him

JOH   The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early when  it 
was  yet  dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the
sepulchre

Whom did they see at the tomb

MAT   And behold there was  a  great  earthquake  for  the angel of the
Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door
and sat upon it
MAT   His countenance was like  lightning  and  his  raiment white as
snow MAT   And for fear of him the keepers did shake  and  became as
dead men MAT   And the angel answered and said unto  the  women  Fear
not ye for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified

MAR   And entering into the sepulchre they saw a  young  man sitting  on 
the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted

LUK   And it came  to  pass  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout
behold two men stood by them in shining garments

JOH   And seeth two angels in white sitting the one at  the head  and 
the  other  at  the feet where the body of Jesus had lain

Belief that the disciples stole Jesus's body

Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story but no other gospel makes
this claim

Appearences of the risen Jesus

Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told
them to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee  The disciples then went
to a mountain previously agreed opon and met Jesus there  This was his only
appearance except to the women at the tomb  Matthew only devotes five verses
to the visit with the disciples

Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country and that
they told the rest of the disciples who refused to believe  Later he
appeared to the  disciples at mealtime

Luke says two followers went the same day that Jesus rose from the dead to
Emmaus a village eight miles from Jeruselem and there Jesus jioned them but
was unrecognised  While they ate a meal together that evening they finally
recognised Jesus whereopon he dissapeared  Returning at once to Jeruselem
they told the
disciples of their experience and suddenly Jesus appeared among them
frightening them as they thought he was a spirit  Jesus then ate some fish
and honey and then preached to them

John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose in
Jeruselem where they were hiding  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them but
Thomas was not present and refused to believe Eight days later Jesus joined
the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas	Once
more Jesus made an
appearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not
recognised
 After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat Jesus
becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them  They all eat
together and converse

The book of acts further adds to the confusion  It says that Jesus showed
himself to the apostles for a period of  days after his resurection thus
contradicting Matthew Mark Luke AND John and spoke to them of things
pertaining to the kingdom of God And when he had spoken these things while
they beheld he was taken up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight 
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up two men stood
by them in white apparel Which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye
gazing into heaven This same Jesus which is taken from you into heaven
shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven Acts 

Paul outdoes every other authority by saying that Jesus was seen by 
persons between the time of the resurection and the
assension although he does not say where	He also claims that he himself as
one born out of due time also saw Jesus  Cor 

The Ascension

Matthew says nothing about it	Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved into
heaven after he was finished talking with the
disciples in Jeruselem  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that
while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven 
John says nothing about it  Acts
contradicts all of the above  See previous section

When second coming

MAT   Verily I say unto you This generation shall not pass till all
these things be fulfilled

MAR   Verily I say unto you that this generation shall  not pass till
all these things be done

LUK   Verily I say unto you This generation shall not  pass away till
all be fulfilled

 thessalonians 

How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention 
 Corinthians  
Matthew  minus one from 
Acts  Mathias not elected until after resurrection
MAT   Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain
where Jesus had appointed them

 ascend to heaven
	And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven  Kings 

	No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven 	
the Son of Man John 

As you can see there are a number of contradictions in the account of the
trial crucifiction and resurection of Jesus  If these are good witnesses
you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right 
In fact I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE  You would think
that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly
observing Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error
the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth
Due to the nature of the story I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of
truth

MC Theory of Creationism MY theistic view of the theory of
MC creationism there  are many others is stated in Genesis
MC   In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth

And which order of Creation do you accept	The story of creation is one of the
many places in the Bible where the Story contradicts itself  The following is
an example

GEN   And God made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle 
after  their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
kind and God saw that it was good
GEN   And God said Let us make man in our image  after  our likeness 
and  let  them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
the air and over the cattle and  over  all the  earth  and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth

GEN   And the LORD God said It is  not  good  that  the  man should be
alone I will make him an help meet for him
GEN   And out of the ground the LORD God formed  every  beast of  the 
field  and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he
would call them and whatsoever  Adam  called every living creature that was
the name thereof

Even your Bible cannot agree on how things were created  Why should we
believe in it

	First I want to start right out and say that I'm a Christian  It 

rh I know I shouldn't get involved but   

rh bit deleted

	The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a 
modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he was
rest of rant deleted

This is a standard argument for fundies  Can you spot the falicy The
statement is arguing from the assumption that Jesus actually existed  So far
they have not been able to offer real proof of that existance  Most of them
try it using the very flawed writings of Josh McDowell and others to prove
it but those writers use VERY flawed sources  If they are real sources at
all some are not  When will they ever learn to do real research instead of
believing the drivel sold in the Christian bookstores

rh Righto DAN try this one with your Cornflakes

rh The book says that Muhammad was either a liar or he was
rh crazy  a  modern day Mad Mahdi or he was actually who he
rh said he was Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as
rh follows  Who would  die for a lie  Wouldn't people be able
rh to tell if he was a liar  People  gathered around him and
rh kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seein
